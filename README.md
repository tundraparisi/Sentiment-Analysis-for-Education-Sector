In the realm of sentiment analysis, this project aimed to provide a comprehensive documentation of the methodology and outcomes associated with the analysis of user reviews on learning objectsâ€”digital educational resources such as tutorials and educational videos. The initial phase of text preprocessing employed a series of techniques, including tokenization, removal of stop words, punctuation removal, and lemmatization. Tokenization involved breaking down the text into individual words or tokens, facilitating subsequent analysis. Stop words, common words like "and" or "the," were removed to focus on meaningful content. Punctuation removal aimed to streamline the text, and lemmatization involved reducing words to their base or root form, enhancing the uniformity of the dataset.

Following text manipulation, the VADER sentiment analysis model was applied to both the manipulated and original versions of the reviews. VADER, or Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, operates by assigning a compound sentiment score to a given text, encapsulating the overall sentiment's polarity and intensity. The model relies on a predefined lexicon with sentiment scores for words and employs grammatical rules to decipher sentiments in context. This approach yielded similar and moderately accurate results for both manipulated and original text, showcasing the versatility of VADER in handling diverse expressions commonly found in user reviews.

The project then transitioned to utilize the VADER model from the Transformers library, an advanced natural language processing (NLP) library. The inclusion of this model enriched the sentiment analysis capabilities, taking advantage of the powerful features offered by Transformers in the realm of sentiment analysis.

In the latter phase of the project, a manually labeled dataset comprising 300 reviews was employed to evaluate the performance of both VADER and RoBERTa, a transformer-based language model. The manual labeling process enhanced the robustness of the evaluation, providing a more secure foundation for assessing the models' performance. Notably, the results were optimal, showcasing the effectiveness of both VADER and RoBERTa in capturing the nuances of sentiment expressed in user reviews.

It is imperative to highlight a significant observation: while VADER's performance remained consistent between manipulated and original text, RoBERTa's performance exhibited considerable differences. Specifically, tokenization alone sufficed for optimal results, while manipulated text yielded suboptimal performance. This discrepancy underscores the sensitivity of RoBERTa to text manipulations and emphasizes the importance of tailoring preprocessing steps to the specific characteristics of the employed model.

In summary, this sentiment analysis project showcased a comprehensive approach, from text manipulation to model application, in the context of user reviews on learning objects. The integration of VADER and RoBERTa, coupled with meticulous manual labeling, provided valuable insights into the sentiment landscape of educational resources, paving the way for further advancements in the field of natural language processing and sentiment analysis within the educational domain.

1,"I spent about a half an hour reviewing the DNA from the beginnings presentation tool.  I found it to be interesting yet informative. 
I thought the content was well presented in a fashion which made it easier to learn.  This tool used animation, video, and sound to create a learning environment which is conducive to all learning styles. 
The site ran quickly and smoothly and without error.  I would recommend to anyone trying to give a visual representation of DNA to a high school class.Technical Remarks:This tool was extremely easy to navigate through.  It would be ok for a beginner/novice to use the tool in the classroom setting.",5,Positive
1,This is a very useful site for a gen ed biology course.,4,Positive
4,"This is a wonderful, informative website!  I spent time reviewing it to help refresh my memory before completing a unit on the brain.  Also, I shared some of the activities with my teacher and classmates at the time (Health in the Elementary Classroom).  I think that some older elementary and even middle school students would enjoy reviewing the website themselves. ",5,Positive
4,I was on the site for a total of 20 minutes and really enjoyed the site.  I found most of the information to be very direct and well said.  This site is very good for kids especially those with burning questions.  I will be keeping this site in mind when I start teaching in my own classroomTechnical Remarks: The website was very fun to look at which is very important in todays childern.  With all the games and vertual reality things avalable its nice to see such a well designed website directed to students.,5,Positive
5,I think that this website offers a great deal of virtual information.  It allows an uninformed user like myself to easily navigate and compare the different skeletal stuctures.  I would definitly recommend this for any anatomy/physiology class.  I spent about 15 minutes comparing different bone structures.  The quality of the content was very well organized and informative.  The user is easily able to compare skeletal structures without ever touching the skeleton itself.  A website of this sort can enhance any user a great amount.  This website represents the growing process of the virtual learning environment.  Technical Remarks: Technically this website is easily navigable for the beginning users.  It offers complex terminology and compelling diagrams that a new user can understand.  This site also allows the users to navigate similar websites through hot links.  It also permits us to use a glossary to help define scientific terminology that users might not comprehend.  Overall this site can greatly improve the knowledge of its users by using comparitive structures and through definitions.,5,Positive
12,"This particular webpage is VERY useful! I spent about 30 minuties clicking on the different applications that it offers. There's everything on there from basic math to statistics. There are numerous games and math activities that you can play with. The content within the site allows you to really understand math. There are instructions, examples, games, and diagrams that are presented in order to comprehend the lessons the site is teaching. I would use many of the games and examples in a classroom. They are an excellent visual aid. I think using this site as a teaching method is a great idea. It would give students the chance to read and then explore games as examples. It's a good hands on exercise. Faculty's teaching will definitely be enhanced. This site is perfect for lectures and activities in a classroom. The site was very simple and easy to use. However, logging on to MERLOW, and browsing for this particular site, I found somewhat difficult. It was difficult because I had to search for topics, and I wouldn't always necessarily come up with what I was looking for. Other than that, this site is highly recommended by me!",5,Positive
20,"Page layout incredibly small, flash window even smaller, text in flash window smaller still. Amounts to glorified textbook with occasional annoying sound effects. Pictures too small to be worthwhile, text hard and inconvenient to read because of size problems on page. No use of actual animation, doesn't include anything you couldn't get better elsewhere.",1,Negative
25,"I'm very impressed with this site.  I entered the site not really knowing what to expect and stayed for awhile.  I'm in the process of writing a paper on Albert Einstein and was amused to find a page of quotations from him.  My favorite (and I'm using it in my paper) is:""Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics, I assure you that mine are greater.""  I will absolutely visit this site again to capture more information regarding my current site as well as look up information regarding other mathematicians I have written about in the past.  The maps are thorough beyond belief and very interesting to see.  The more you explore this site the more you uncover.  There seems to be a gem at each turn.Technical Remarks: Very simple.  My biggest problem was wanting to go everywhere and getting lost in my own thoughts.  A few times, I completely lost my focus because something more interesting caught my eye.",5,Positive
28,"A clear and detailed approach to explaining the concepts of academic integrity and plagiariarism. Of particular use for busy professors may be the quiz and resulting completion certificate (including student score) that may be emailed to the professor or student.Technical Remarks:Viewers may find they need to enlarge their screen display, as some of the text can appear quite small.",5,Positive
50,Sadly the physical Newseum location closed in 2019. There are still three online resource exhibits that are available to utilize. One of these is Today's Front Pages where newspapers from all over the world submit their daily headlines to the site. The remaining content in this site would be effective to provide additional resources or information about specific topics covered. Learners engaged in this material would need specific support and guidance from their instructor. The interface is easy to navigate and understand but there is not much information included on the website any more.,3,Negative
56,"This learning object is extremely well designed, engaging, and entertaining (especially the humorous names of the fictional employees).   The 4 cases are directly relevant to ethical decisions in the current e-commerce environment.  Although the issues are e-commerce related, the presentation would easily adapt to any course dealing with ethical decision making.Technical Remarks:The choice to do still-frame flash animation with audio was extremely wise, and the model would be easy to extend.  I am very impressed with the choice of design and the parallel structures the materials in all four cases provided.",5,Positive
62,"This page can be used to complement either an Introduction to Management or Organizational Behavior course. It provides a good introduction to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, McGregor's Theory X vs. Theory Y, and Herzberg's Motivation Theory. Graphics are visually appealing. ",3,Positive
66,A collection of applets covering many topics in modern physics. Almost all of them were very good.,4,Positive
73,"I enjoyed visiting this site and the practice Quiz. I believe this would be a great tool tointroduce to my students in the virtual classroom, maybe as a Learning Activity in the next course redesign. I found the concept great; a little more body shoudl be dedicated perhaps to the preparatory phase (prior to taking the Quiz).",4,Positive
73,"I would have stayed longer but time ran out, I simply looked around.  It is interesting.  I would look into this site another time.Technical Remarks: Not a complicated site to explore.",4,Positive
80,Excellent videos. Will definitely provide this resource to my MS Word students. ,5,Positive
95,I have used this applet for many semesters but recently have had to give it up because of Java issues. WISE is working on revision of their applets to improve the ease of use but this one isn't there yet. I keep checking though because it is a great visualization of the changes in the sampling distribution resulting from changes in sample size. The worksheet provided with the applet makes it possible to assign as homework with computer-literate students.,4,Neutral
103,This site provides valuable resources for newcomers to online teaching as well as for faculty members who are looking for new ideas and strategies to improve the quality of their distance classes.,4,Positive
104,This is a good tool to make your own learning profile. It could be used to create learning preferences/ styles of students on day 1 of a training session or as a ice breaker also with double advantage.Technical Remarks:The display of scale is bit non-readable. The learning preferences have been abbreviated here. It would be good to provide full name of learning preferences on the scale.,4,Positive
104,An interesting take on learning styles. I found the information very useful.,4,Positive
105,"It would be nice if the user could start, stop, rewind, fast forward the audio.  Content is accurate and presented very well, but the navigational elements of the tool are lacking.",3,Neutral
116,The materials reviewed are user-friendly in nature with a great deal of stimulating content.  The multiple choice tutorials/drill and practice modules are effective in teaching various human systems and processes.,3,Positive
116,I am a New York State certified Biology teacher that is currently working on my master's.  I needed to make up a lesson plan that incorporated technology so I chose to use several sites from the Merlot site.  I found the graphs in this site to be very accurate.Technical Remarks: I though this site was a great tool for students to use to review the human body systems.  It is not always easy to look at a book and try and remember the different parts of the body systems.  This site actually lets students test and retest themselves.  The site is very easy to maneuver around and is very easy to access.  I had no trouble navigating around the site.,4,Positive
126,This page cannot be found.,1,Negative
131,"This material is fun with a simple format covering 4 sections, and yet the different secions have their own unique exercises. The varied exercises, true/false, fill in the blank, choose the correct picture, etc. provide a good challenge and kept things fresh. The amount of material is great too. Some objects overwhelm with too much info, but this material gets it just right.Technical Remarks:Everything works good. No issues for me.",5,Positive
140,"This website was very helpful in coming up with ideas on how to explain scientific concepts to children. The cartoons help make the concepts clear and easy to understand. I really liked how there were activity ideas given to help reinforce the concepts. The interactiveness of the website is great, where you can take a quiz to see how much you understand about the topic.Technical Remarks:The site was easy to navigate through and there were no technical difficulties involved with this site.",4,Positive
163,Great acid base tutorial that you can print out a certificate at the end to prove that you've gone through the entire program.,4,Positive
172,"This resource promises more than it delivers.  Two of the links were broken and of the links that worked did not work well and one would require a person to purchase a test.This may have been a good site at one time, but it needs updating.",2,Negative
172,"Right brain, left brain theory is more pop psychology than science. Indeed, the utility of identifying learning styles is questionable at best.",1,Negative
175,Business Ethics is almost a required course at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This site does provide valuable information to teachers of this course. I currently teach Business ethics and I found this to be very helpful.,4,Positive
179,"I wish I had found this site when teaching Accounting. I did forward this on to the Dean. What a great interactive site, I love how if the answer is incorrect, the rationale is given why the answer is incorrect.Technical Remarks:Easy to use, so much information.",5,Positive
198,"From the introduction, I expected to find some structures in relation to discovery for research writing.  What I experienced was rhetoric on a process that did not come to fruition.  I clicked on a couple of the links but was disappointed when they did not yield any additional information.Technical Remarks:Too vague so I will not revisit this site even if it is updated periodically.",1,Negative
199,Users of this site can access and download a variety of resources for classroom presentations and activities related to microbiology. The materials that are available are peer reviewed and the site continues to grow as more contributions are solicited and reviewed. There is a search function that assists in finding appropriate materials.,5,Positive
217,"This is a great interactive tool for learning how to read a food label. It is not in the format of the new nutrition facts panel that will be required beginning in July 26, 2018.",4,Positive
221,"This tutorial is a great blueprint for designing online courses.  Some of the questions readers are invited to consider are unusual in this kind of resources--such as those that ask the course developer to consider the context of other courses offered in the department.  The workshop suggestions are thorough.  The tutorial would have been even more powerful, though, if the authors had used some of the ""cutting edge"" knowledge of exemplary course design in developing it.",4,Positive
221,"This is a very thorough, well-designed, and thoughtful approach to putting together a course. It could be used by a novice instructor or as a refresher for someone who has been designing courses for some time and wants to be sure that he/she is on track creating solid student learning goals. The authors provide some solid take-aways in the form of worksheets that educators can reuse in designing future courses and many links and ideas that will improve the design of different types of courses. This should take anyone reading carefully and completing the worksheets between 1-2 hours to complete. It can be used in faculty development settings or just as a self-study.",5,Positive
253,Interesting resource for teachers whom seek to explore education aspects within China. This resources also provides testimonials from Chinese students in a way that other children can relate to. This site also contains links to supporting material that teachers and students can access for more information regarding the life of many Chinese students and the general public.,4,Positive
267,"I spent about 35 minutes reading the material on this site. Then I spent another 25 trying it. It has a lot of information and makes you put your brain to work. I made some of the materials way more complicated than it really was. I enjoyed working out the puzzles. The site covers many topics and provides solutions. The site provides great visualization of the subject, therefore making it interesting. Its actually not as easy as it seems, to solve some of the puzzle. It is defiantly time consuming but fun. It helps a person develop critical thinking skills for sure. The materials presented are educationally significant but may seem hard to understand at first. The site contained graphics which was a great help. The material may seem a bit unclear because it seemed to me like it was lacking an introduction to the concepts. I would say that using this site as a teaching aid would not be the best way to go about teaching students on the matters described. It is an interesting tool for those who have a passion and great interest in math. Those who have the time and like math puzzles will defiantly enjoy this and probable could spend hours working on them.Technical Remarks:At first the site seems like its not to user friendly, but after some time anyone can defiantly get the hang of it. The puzzles are very interactive and interesting if you spend the time to work on them. The site can be improved to make it easier for users, because the concepts are were useful.",4,Positive
267,"The time I spent was trying and reviewing the material from this link.  From this, I spent most of my time trying to figure out what to do on the site to try to figure out the problems or issues discussed.    Many of the problems I had to read a few times to try to figure out what there was to do and how to solve the problem.  I was also interested to see what all the other links were on the problems, as possible steps to help work through the problems.	I found the whole thing to be quit difficult.  When I am on the internet looking at a web like this, I feel like I am always looking for the fastest way to find the answer to my question.  When I am looking at something like Math, I want to look at a book.  I feel this site and problems had no introduction that was clear.	I have taken other internet classes at San Jose State and I found those class sites to be much easier to use.  Everything was a step by step process making it very clear.  This site should be completely redone and make is more user-friendly.  At least I found it to be this way for The Three Puzzles.",1,Negative
269,Very interesting,5,Positive
283,"Excellent collection of culturally authentic (currently 2600+) images. Entries are divided into categories and subcategories. Nouns only, no verbs (that I found).
Site may be browsed or searched. Images may be copied and used in presentations, etc.Technical Remarks:Search engine worked well.
Each item linked to Leo and Wikipedia, when available.",4,Positive
287,The site has a good outline of the dvd.  Unfortunately I was unable to see the video.,3,Neutral
301,"I reviewed the site ""Virtual Mummy:Unwrapping AMummy By Mouse Click"".  This was not only a veryinformative site but it was also a very fun site tointeract with.  It is very helpful because it shows manyimages and even has quicktime movies of differentmummies.  You can learn a lot about how medicallyknowledgable the Egyptians were before ost othercivilizations even knew what the body was.  This siteshows any different views of mummies and it even letsyou see a mummy unwrapped layer by layer.  This site isa very good one because not only is it a cool site tovisit, but it also provides you with a 'hands on' typeof learning experience.  The only problem I found withthe site is that you must download an upgrade to mediaplayer to view it, but it is a short download and it isdefinatly worth it.      ",5,Positive
310,"This is another example of the the field of Psychology ""going off the deep end."" Wait until child molesters and sexual predators have their day with the DSM. I did not like the site because the behavior behind it is not acceptable.",1,Negative
316,"Contains SEE (artificial) signs but does not identify them as such.  Does not contain grammatical instruction.  Contains many English synonyms that are mapped to a single sign.  For example, ""abrupt"" and ""accelerate"" are mapped to the same sign (FAST), but it is unlikely that this sign would be used to translate either word in context, especially given that one is an adverb and the other is a verb.  ",1,Negative
319,"This site is now apparently a subscription-only service. I could not see even a sample of what is available. There is some procedure to obtain limited access for a short period of time, but one cannot review any of site without going through that process. ",1,Negative
323,"It is a very rich material which covers the main concepts about Learning Machine. I wouldn't suggest this material in a self study context because, in my opinion, a good mathematical background is needed.",4,Positive
340,I found the list of errors to be quite extensive.  The accompanying explanation is helpful.  I can see how this reference can be used in an assignment for students to improve their usage.,4,Neutral
346,"This resource is bogus.  The resource itself is probably ok but it is not free, even though it has a CC BY NC license on it.  This is the kind of thing that sets OERs back 10 years.",1,Negative
366,The concept is a good one to reach the intended target audience and the interactive nature of the lesson is ideal for this population.  Use of various combinations of text and graphics helps to engage the learner of this age and to keep their attention.  I only wish that I was able to experience the actual interactive components but unfortunately the links weren't working for me.  ,4,Positive
367,"I just spent an hour and fifteen minutes at this site. I found it to be very well put together & easy to get around in. The information is presented in an easy to follow pattern from start to finish. I understood most of what I perused except the technical math notation. A person of any age would benefit from this site. It offers math, history, art & science all at one time! Students and teachers alike can find many ideas and concepts in the material to enhance their own learning objectives. I could spend hours at this site & will probably return to it again sometime. I love looking at the fractal examples & ""playing"" with them (via the computer mouse)!",5,Positive
376,This video is AWESOME if it could get more than five stars I would give it. its a simple video that gets to the point with not just an explaination but visualization. I have watched other videos by the same author and they have come very handy.,5,Positive
427,"On its own this video is absolute garbage. Anyone with a modest grasp of economics will cringe at Leonard's unsatisfactory analysis.Pros: Great production value, compelling presentation, and well known outside economics department (i.e. allows students to reach outside of their discipline while on campus).Cons: Overrun with economic fallacies and poor analysis.Recommended use: This video could be used to teach students about rhetoric, and how to write about economic issues. Debunking this video provides almost endless possibilities for student op-eds. I wouldn't recommend using this in a principles class, but in an upper division class with a talented lecturer, it could be torn apart in class.",1,Negative
442,"Everything you could want to know about prime numbers. Lots of information to browse and plenty of links to continue reading after. It took me a while to look through just their long list of known primes. This site has handy tips for how to calculate primes, both big and small, and is recently updated. The formatting is heavily text oriented, but the content is easily read.",4,Positive
464,"While I found the readings on this site to likely be engaging and possibly challenging for grade 4-12 learners (as noted in the Teacher's Guide, or grade 6-12 learners as noted in the About section), several aspects of the layout and, more notably, what seem to be problems with updates to the site would keep me for using it.

As of the writing of this comment, the Quizzes, Notes and Proof for each reading seem to be no longer accessible (users ""not authorized to use this page""). The Speak Out chat section from the home page is also non-functional (""page cannot be found""). While the Tips-o-Matic option still leads to useful information on sentence to essay level grammar, it apparently was at one time meant to be able to be ""turned on"" for interactive assistance with readings offered on the site--this is no longer the case. Finally, while the Teacher's Guide offers sound suggestions for use in the classroom, it obviously has not been updated for some time, as it continues to list RealAudio as a ""new type of computer software."" Some continuing maintenance (e.g. the ongoing addition of new suggestions for classroom or student autonomous use) would be helpful here.",2,Negative
466,Contains excellent pictures useful to beginning or veteran practitioners for initial study or review.,4,Positive

490,This is wonderful. The material is well-organized and engaging for all students.Technical Remarks:The technological aspect is excellent. Each link provides information that will keep one reading and not wanting to stop.,5,Positive
495,This is an excellent resource! it is well-structured and there is much to learn from the components of this moving and realistic case study.In an ideal world I'd have liked some interpretation and references to enhance the learning. Technical Remarks:Requires Flash. The whole package of resources can be downloaded as an IMS content package with a CC licence: by-nc-sa.,5,Positive

526,"This site contains an array of information for classroom use. The basic information about color and color uses is good for beginning art students, as well as, art teachers. The site is easy to follow and it does not have an over-abundance of information to confuse students. This was a good site for introducing middle-age students to color and value. The pre-made power-point presentation is a time-saving valuable tool for educators. The site featured a section on artroom activites that was used by an eighth grade art class. The thirty-five students that visited the site were asked to go into the color theory vocab site and find answers that pertained to color. As far as using the site, the students answers ranged from really easy to difficult. I received a variety of responses to the questions I asked of the students. I was surprised to learn that quite a few students prefer to learn about certain aspects of art from the website.There were some students that would prefer to learn from an instructor.  Once the students finished looking at the site they were given directions that pertained to what they learned about color and color mixing. The color theory site gave a variety of examples of student work that is always refreshing to see. I will be using this site again when I have a new classroom full of students. I do believe the visuals really help.Technical Remarks:Most of the site was easy to use. I found that when using the drawing program that a popup would continue to show up.",4,Positive

606,"I spent about 45 minutes to an hour browsing through this site.  The quality of content was excellent with good, solid advice.  It answered tough questions, such as, will my child's anxiety go away naturally, how do I choose a child therapist, and how do I differentiate treatment. It had information on many disorders, lots of links for related information, and resources for educational toys, CD's and videos for children.Technical Remarks: First time users will navigate easily through this website.",5,Positive

660,"This Podcast really helps me to learn a lesson. I never realized Task Significance is important and make a lot of different in our jobs. Most people don't think their work can benefit others in some ways, therefore, job seems like a way to feed ourselves an d the family. From the Podcast, i know that it can increase the motivation of the employees simply by make them realize how their daily work benefit some people even most people in the world. i think all companies should consider about the task significance in their work.",5,Positive
660,"Task signficance only affects certain jobs. It can only motivate certain types of people. This is why management have different managing theories for different types of jobs. The podcast is also a bit repetitive and very slow moving. The meat of the podcast could be summed up rather easily. Into a few simple points: many jobs can be improved with task signficance, task signficance can improve jobs because it motivates employees to work harder therefore turning higher earnings.",3,Negative
660,"I found the topic of task significance to be very interesting. As someone who does want to make a difference and have a purpose in life but not necessarily let my job or work define my entire life, it is nice to know that a person's job may have high task significance regardless of job titles, such as CEO, supervisor or manager.Even a lowly data entry personel can still contribute a lot to his or her company. It was also fascinating to hear about how motivation and productivity can be boosted just by showing employees how they positively affect those around them.",4,Positive
660,"Adam Grant had pointed out some facts to me that I have never thought about. There are jobs that are people are doing which helps other people without knowing, for example authors and readers, the authors never meet all their readers. They do not know how much their effort and work can affect a person. Also, I found Mr. Grant and I have one thing similarly, life guarding. I use to be a lifeguard and I totally agree with him, you rarely need to jump in to perform any savings. I worked as a lifeguard for almost 3 years and I have never read a story about how important my job was, now I am hearing how my work would effect people, I probably would have stayed and worked longer with job satisfaction.",5,Positive
660,"I thought the Podcast on ""Task Significance"" by Mark Adam was very informative. Starting a new job is very exciting for many people. But as time goes on, these people start to lose interest in their job and forget why they ever wanted these jobs. Yet, by getting employees interested in their jobs again, motivation in the workplace increased dramatically. For any business to be successful, businesses must remember to keep their employees satisfied with their jobs. If an employee does not approve of a business, then how can a customer approve of that same business?",4,Positive
660,"The podcast helps bring out a message that high task significance is not only important to people's life but also the value to themselves. People tend to work harder and happier when they realize that their works can really make a difference. Example of lifeguard from Adam Grant impresses me because I have never thought about why some lifeguards like to work with such long hours and not so high pay, but now I realize that money is not the only first consideration to people while they choose their jobs but the feeling of satisfaction.",4,Positive
660,"Interesting, yet at the same time predictable. I think for the most part, and perhaps I am speaking on my own behalf, it is in human nature to feel compassion for others. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit it, but I don't really go out of my way on a daily basis seeking to help others... But, when I do so, I'm left with a satisfied feeling.If my job impacted people positively (which it currently does not, unfortunately), I would definitely feel more motivated to work harder, perform better, etc...",4,Neutral
660,"I've never heard of Task Significance before I heard this podcast. But after listening to Adam Grant talk about what it is and how it is used in the work place, I was able to understand how important task significance is in the working environment. I believe that all managers should take Grant's ideas into consideration, such as the interventions that he discussed. If it worked for those employees to work harder in benefiting other people, then it should be shown to those employees who only work for self-interest.",4,Positive
660,I think that task significance has a huge and psitive influence on jobs' performance. it remarkably helps the workers to work together and in a good condition to achieve their goal which is the satisfaction of the customers. Task significance is considered as a kind of motivation for the employees to well- serve all the stakeholders and the society where they live.,4,Neutral
660,"I agree with Adam Grant about the importance of task significance, and the effect on job performance. Employees in high task significant jobs tend to be more motivated, and when introduce directly to the people who benefit from their work, their motivation and job performance increases dramatically. However, I believe task significant has little or no effects on employees in low task significant jobs, and probably will not increase job performance.",4,Neutral
660,"This is a new topic to me that ""task significant."" I think it is very important to find the task significants while they are working. Workers need to improve their efficiency and it impacts on their satisfaction directly. I guess that Adam Grant's two examples, which based on his research and experience, are interesting stories and this interview is useful infomation for students.",3,Positive
660,"I think the Podcast is pretty interesting. It is totally true that task significance makes a big difference in employees. Putting myself as an example, a lot of times I go to work,  all I can think is that I want to go home right away because some days I just don't find any motivation to be at work. However, other days I really enjoy being at work because I can see how customers and coworkers appreciate my work, and it Just feels very nice to see that what you do has a positive impact in other people. I think it is very important that managers understand that having excellent employees has a lot to do with task significance. Employees always need to know that their work makes a difference and it is appreciated by others in other with be motivated at work.  when employees Know that what they do affects others in a positive way , they feel important because they feel their job is worth it; as a result, they perform better.",5,Positive
660,"I found this podcast very interesting, before listening to this podcast I had never heard about the concept of task significance. The concept makes sense, I think people will perform better with knowledge of the importance of their job.",4,Positive
660,"Task significance depends on the person and job. All people would love to be recognized for their efforts. But on the other hand you should know you did something good for another person, and you shouldn't have to be reminded. Yeah, its a great way to motivate people but you should do things because you want to, not because you have to.",4,Neutral
660,"I've had a lot of jobs over the years, and looking back I can see a very big difference in both my attitude and work ethic when I worked at a place which gave me low task significance. I feel like work ethic and motivation are directly related to how we see our jobs and our roles in a company. Positive reinforcement is always a great motivator, but for employers who can't always reward an employee there is task significance. Its always nice to know that the effort we put into a job is not for nothing.

Although this site specifically deals with East European Jewish history and Yiddish culture, it could be used effectively in Western Civilization, advanced European, and other college courses, especially for courses that touch on the Holocaust or Eastern Europe. Among the site's many features are careful timelines, interactive maps(especially useful for tracking changes in East European political geography and the emigration of Jews to North America), as well as numerous photographs culled from YIVO's massive archives. One point our seminar addressed is that the Institute grants permission for fair-use photographic reproduction from the site, provided that credit is given to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. One of the site's most remarkable features, located in Places/Lublin, is a walk down Lubartovka Steet, which is not only interactive but provides translations of Yiddish and Polish signage.

1794,"I reviewed this book with the thought of using it for an undergraduate epidemiology class. Therefore, my comments and overall rating about this online resource should be read with that in mind.  The author recommends Lessons 1-5 if the textbook is used for this target audience.  
Content
The content of ActivEpi is comprehensive and represents current thinking in the field of epidemiology.  These concepts are often taught in masters level epidemiology methods courses, and I would suggest that group as a target audience.  
Format of ActivEpi
The layout of the textbook is simple and very well thought out.  The homepage lists all 15 lessons.  If you click on a lesson, you will see a brief overview of the lesson along with links for 3-5 mini-lessons, homework exercises and a list of references for that lesson.  
I highly recommend that you watch the video listed under Lesson 1: Introduction – How to Use ActivEpi Web (video) as you will find valuable information for navigating the website.  For example, ActivEpi has a great glossary.  If you click on “Glossary”, you will see clickable buttons at the top of the page for each letter of the alphabet allowing you to quickly navigate to the correct glossary section.  Under the word, you will find its definition along with clickable links to where that word is used in different lessons.  
Once you have begun a lesson, key words used in that lesson are in clickable drop-down boxes along the right side of the page providing the definition.  On each lesson page, the content is primarily delivered in a series of short videos which stop often for the viewer to absorb the content, consider a question or perform a calculation.  
Quizzes are available at the end of most lesson pages which tests the user’s understanding of the content and ability to apply that knowledge.  Quizzes are automatically graded and the users are allowed unlimited attempts.  Homework assignments are given at the end of each lesson.  Answers to the homework lessons are available upon request from the author.  
A few suggestions
I have very few complaints about this textbook.  The textbook is laid out in lessons which cover everything from measures of frequency to counterfactuals and stratified analyses.  The content is comprehensive although I would have liked to see more on basic descriptive epidemiology, surveillance, reading scientific literature and ethics. 
The first content lesson (2), introduces students to epidemiology in terms of the overall picture using one study as an example which I like conceptually.  However, I think my students would really struggle with the content on those first two pages.  Several major epidemiologic concepts are introduced including: the study question, variable measurement, study design, measures of frequency/effect, bias and data analysis.  In addition, there are links which provide information about criteria for causality and a counterfactual basis for causation.  I am concerned undergraduate students will not be able to follow this lesson without previous exposure to those concepts.  
Summary
I believe that ActivEpi is a comprehensive, accurate, informative, easy to understand online textbook with a user friendly interactive interface.  I believe instructors who teach masters level epidemiology methods courses should seriously consider using this valuable online resource.    ",4,Positive

However, theanimation could be improved by enlarging thetemperature scale, in order to provide for moreaccuracy when estimating the temperature change in themetal bar.  Since it was mentioned what units positionand time were measured in, it could have been includedwhat units the temperature scale showed.  8.12.2        I enjoyed the animation of the growing bubble risingto the surface of the liquid to burst.  The countingvertical position scale also aided in performing theratio computation.  However, after carefullyperforming the final to initial temperature ratiocalculation, I disagree with the featured result.  Icalculated the ratio to be 6.05.   8.12.3        This animation clearly underlines the properties ofan ideal gas and is nicely done in a, however, purelyqualitative manner.  Overall, I?m not sure that theproperties of an ideal gas need this kind of elaborateillustration.  Simple pictures would have sufficed.8.12.4        The speed vs. time graph nicely illustrates thechanges in the speed of the molecules of the gaseoussubstance but aids little in showing the average speedof the molecules. This visualization could be improvedby displaying the average speed of the differentspheres at the end of the animation to assist in thecalculation of the average kinetic energy.8.12.5        In this problem, a gas is compressed at constantpressure and seemingly at the constant temperature of0 *C.  Since the container appears tight (no moleculescan escape),
 I can only ask how is this processpossible.  The pressure should have been visualized ina better manner.  The gauge added more confusion thanit cleared up.  More work needs to be done in orderfor one to make sense of this problem.  Additional Problem 1)        I had a hard time changing the temperature of the gasin theleft container in the running time provided. The running time should be increased to counteract notonly this problem, but also in order for the system tobe allowed to come to equilibrium.Additional Problem 2)        This physlet worked well and is a good illustrationof the distribution of speeds in a gas.This site could benefit from a more detaileddescription of the problems? initial conditions.

This sections also lends it self to multiple methods of face 2 face instruction, like Power Point, Voicesthread, and Wikis. Lastly, the socialization aspect of this StAIR seems lacking socialization.

3692,I like the program. It allows students to see information in all the different representations that we are now learning.,5,Positive
3708,"I have taught both these subjects about color and food in separate contexts and in different French levels.  The  content  covering  color vocabulary   and expressing  likes and dislikes  in French   in appropriate  for  FRENCH 1 LEVEL I A (meaning first semester of French) whereas food( fruits and vegetables)  related vocabulary, grammar  (the French verbs  to eat, to buy, good eating habits) are appropriate for the  FRENCH 1B (meaning second semester of French).  What interactive activity can be offered for students to speak or write exclusively in French and post on blog?Technical Remarks:No technical difficulties",3,Neutral
3727,"This is an incredibly useful lesson. In today's world of email and texting students tend to blur the lines between formal and informal. Teaching students how to write a proper email to a professor (or really any professional) is an extremely valuable skill. The lesson walks through ideas on how to teach this skill.If the instructional design incorporated more detail on exactly what students will be asked to do (example: sample assignment with rubric) it will become more accessible for educators to use. When it comes to evaluation it is stated that students will be working together to revise their emails, however, the role of the teacher is not directly addressed, this is why a rubric might come in handy.It would be beneficial for there to be an activity incorporated with a rubric. In addition it would be more pedagogically sound if examples of good/bad emails were provided for students to dissect (this could be adapted to be done in class with just discussion or done using some sort of on-line discussion forum). This lesson could easily be transformed into a Webquest format with more detail on instructional procedure and more direction provided for students. It says that it will be given in Moodle but it is not clear on what that will look like (provide a link if it is already created in Moodle).Technical Remarks:The technology component can easily be adapted to any email service that students are using. Perhaps it would be a good idea to incorporate an overview lesson of how to use different features of the email service before beginning the email writing piece.There is a colaborative component where students will be commenting on each other's emails (this could be adapted to be done in class with just discussion or done using some sort of on-line discussion forum). Either way it does a great job of opening the door to pair-sharing which is a fantastic pedagogical strategy.",4,Positive

3766,"UDL guidlines are well represented.  The appearance is colorful but not overbearing, and the use of different size, color and type of font is attractive.   I like the way you added some comedy, music and sound effects.  Additionally, there are multiple means of representation as there are not only slides but also web links from a hospital and a physical therapy organization  and a link for a worksheet.  The only thing that may be missing is the possiblity for students to hear what has been written.Technical Remarks:The lesson is easy to navigate through and there are no problems with the links or action buttons. Also, the timing of everything is great!  Well done.",5,Positive
3767,This is a great stand alone project for students who are on level in reading. Adding audio would also include the students who are below level. I believe students may get confused about what and where to click in the slide.  I was confused about where to click. I clicked on the red words and the slide chages. I went back to get back to the slide and started over.Technical Remarks:All links worked.,3,Positive
3854,"I like this website because it is very useful to the user from different background which allows the learner to extract and access variety of information such as National geography, UTexas Library, internet picture dictionary and animation factory.

3927,"I surveyed several portions on the neurophysiology and drug addiction module.  I have materials of my own that I have prepared and revised since 1996 on this topic.  I have previously drawn on resources from NIH (NIDA in particular) and find them extremely useful.  This new NIH neurophysiology and addiction module has some new graphics, animations, etc. that are very instructive.  The student portion of the site is excellent, and there are plenty of instructor preparation materials to guide the teacher.Technical Remarks: High quality materials and information based on recent research (e.g. PET Scans) in the neurophysiology and addiction module.  I have not looked at the other modules.",5,Positive

4022,"The visual appeal of the overall presentation is outstanding.  The color scheming provides a pleasing, though not distracting visual element for the presentation.  Coupled with the fun and innovative pictures, I can not imagine a student that would not get a kick out of it.  The instructional video that was linked within the presentation provided a good bit of information to aid in understanding.  What I did not like was having that video as, what seems like the only instructional piece within this presenation.  I would have liked to see more variety in teaching.  The volume of practice at the end and the link to the ""Rags to Riches"" game provided students with a lot of practice to demonstrated understanding.  Technical Remarks:I did have an issue with the ""incorrect"" slide.  Each time it would prompt me with a dialogue box asking about a certain file designator that I did not have.  I easily clicked ""cancel"" and the picture of Wyle E. Coyote came bouncing in anyway.  Not obtrusive, but a bit of a nuisance if I end up getting a lot wrong.",3,Positive

Up to date films and quite good extracts of movies.-",4,Positive

4122,"As a stand alone project this is done well, however for use with 2nd grade students there may be a problem for students that have difficulty in reading.

4183,"This project is designed for adult learners so it was less   “razzle dazzle” and more informative. Utilized two principles of the NETS for Administrators  which was similar to lesson plan: Excellence in Professional Practice, and Systemic Improvement,  The quizzes were great and I enjoyed the extra tool added for the date calendar.Technical Remarks:I would have liked to have seen a better ending for this project. Specifically, a home button after the last slide",3,Neutral

4218,"Comprehensiveness
This textbook is very comprehensive of US copyright law. However, it does not address international copyright law issues. One of the best things about this book is that it is very recent and, as such, it contains examples of very modern cases on things like the enforceability of creative commons licenses. One downside of the book is that it contains a no-derivatives license. This makes it less ""open"" than a traditional open access book.
Content Accuracy
The content is provided by two law professors who are experts in the field. It is high quality content. That said, it really is the type of book best aimed at law students because it uses the traditional ""case method"" of teaching, which is typical of law classes.
Relevance Longevity
The content is very up-to-date and includes both watershed cases as well as modern cases. It will, of course, need to be updated in the future.
Clarity
The text is clear and free from grammatical issues.",5,Positive

4393,"Nice job explaining the background and need for this activity.  Students definitely need to know how to work with number sentences and create their own number story.  This is vital in the real world- and you did a good job of helping students understand and activate prior knowledge and experiences.  You gave the students several chances to communicate and collaborate with peers.  They could ask for assistance, as well as work together to create a product.  Students with lesser skills could be helped by peers with greater knowledge and skills.   Students had several learning strategies to follow.  They were given inductive reasoning to help solve a problem as a class, they were given chances to explore their own problems and create solutions, and students also used deductive reasoning if they needed to help a partner solve a problem.  I enjoyed the way the students were able to choose creative expression in their use of TuxPaint.  Students would be familiar with this program, and had a guideline to follow (create a number sentence and illustrate with pictures) but were given ability to be creative in how they expressed their answer.  Students would be able to draw a picture or create illustrations to match the problem in their mind.  Great wrap up to the lesson as well, students were able to share their creations with their peers and learn from others.  Students will also enjoy the whole class assignment once the teacher has created the slideshow with all the numerical equations pictures.",4,Positive
4424,"I think it is great that you are creating a lesson that is relevant to the time period of the election and using Rock the Vote because it is so well known. It is good that you are giving the students background knowledge and going over important vocabulary terms. This will help the students to better understand the information that they will encounter while completing the project. I think it is great that the students get to experience the whole political platform process and are able to create their own platform.  I like that this is project-based because it is a real-life problem and it is a very motivational strategy.  I think that the project is very relevant and engaging for the students.  I like the incorporation of technology and the use of interactive timelines. I would be very interested in seeing this in action. Overall, it is a great, engaging and relevant lesson!Technical Remarks:I was able to easily open the PDF. ",5,Positive
4475,"This lesson begins with a good tutorial on how to work in blackboard.  It is very nice to see exactly what you need to do, rather than instructions in the form of a list for visual learners.  After this is done, students have to actually click everything they would need to for their tasks in blackboard.  This is great because before they ever get the chance to do it, they have done it.  This lesson appeals to different learning styles because you see it, hear it, and also have to do it.  This method of creating a tutorial could be very useful for anything that needs to be done on a computer and gives practice throughout (This is something I would like to learn after viewing this lesson!).  The quiz at the end of the sections is a good review to make sure that you are ready to try this on your own.  It is also useful that the video jumps to an answer if you get it wrong.",5,Positive

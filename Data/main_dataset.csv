0,Thank you for the excellent service that was relevant a few years ago and continues to be relevant today.,4
0,"This is an outstanding peace of information inded. The whole topic on Authentic Assessment has been adequately exhausted, well presented and the content easily comprehensible.The author's approach to the topic was appropriate as the assumtions of each assessment type were stated as a launching pad for the presentation.I have used the the authentic assessment tool some time ago in an exceptional education classroom in a high school and I can attest that students' enthusiam in the project just hit the roof. My students wre classified as being learning disabled, and from that expeience, I learnt from their engagement in the project that it is critically important for teachers to, at anytime in the teaching and learning process, identify whatever instructional strategy that will fully benefit them. Students with learning disabilities in particular, dislike monotony, especially if the learning tasks are so regimented and uninteresting. Authentic Assessments are, therefore, one sure way of getting them interested and engaged. Even though the author does not single out any category of learners as being the most appropriate beneficiaries of AA, I have course to believe that those with learning disabilities will benefit from it the most, if well handled.I particularly like the author's emphasis on the need for a combination of the types of assessments. Of course, it couldn't be all about one or the other. ",5
0,"A complete site to learn concepts, methodology and tools for assessment. It provides useful guidelines and examples in different areas.",4
0,"This is a great tool in developing relative assesments and guidelines. Very well written, and great examples.",4
0,Well build and plenty of information. easy to read and consistant in information.Technical Remarks:I find it overwhelming in paragraph after paragraph of information. ,4
0,"The example of the mentor/mentee in learning how to properly phrase an Authentic Assessment for a course assignment is excellent.  I currently use most of the language in attempting to clearly communicate to students what is expected, ""before"" it is due.  After reading this example, I have a better understanding of how to direct and guide students to particular areas that will be expected. I have a new course beginning tomorrow and am excited about incorporating this new knowledge.  ",5
0,"Great resource for learning about authentic assessment.  What's especially nice, is that this resource doesn't stop at the ""what"" but it elaborates on the ""why"" and ""how"" of using authentic assessment.",4
0,"Very thorough and clear definitions, explanations and examples. It is difficult, however, to construct a site that includes information for k-12 as well as higher education. There are fewer examples from higher ed and some of the k-12 examples in the main text may be off-putting for higher ed faculty.",4
0,This a great site for resources about assessments. ,4
0,"This toolbox reinforced the principles that I use for clinical reasoning and competency based instruction where paper and pencil tests just don't ensure that students can perform in real world scenarios.  As an occupational therapy educator, I am always trying to simulate real world clinical situations and this learning environment gave me some new tools as well as support for what I am doing in the classroom.  Great site.",5
0,"This is one of the more useful sites out there on Outcomes Assessment.  I particularly find it helpful that it provides both the big picture about assessment (formative and summative) as well as specific information about developing rubrics (holistic and analytical).  While there are examples more relevant for K-12, there are also examples relevant for college level.",5
0,"As a member of an assessment team, I found this instruction to be one of the better ones for educating new teachers - and to remind seasoned teachers what testing is supposed to doTechnical Remarks:The toolbox is essy to navigate and has many good tips",4
0,This is a wonderful site to use as a review and resource on assessment tools and how to use them.  Mueller gives examples that are easily accessible. My students really find this site helpful.,4
0,I will recommend this material to colleagues and we hope to begin using the material. It was very organized and appeared to be very useful.,5
0,Helped me to format a rubric for my TB133 classTechnical Remarks:Easy to understand,4
0,I have used this website as an instructor.  I specifically used this website to create a rubric for two MERLOT site lessons that I taught to my General Methods of Teaching students.  I then allowed the students to access the website and required them to create two authentic assessments for an upcoming lesson that they will teach. Students commented that this is a site they will refer to often and wished they had known about it earlier.  They were amazed at all of the information that this site contained.Technical Remarks: Students had no problems utilizing the site.,5
0,"The information within this website is thorough in providing foundational terminology regarding authentic assessment.  Navigating such a site can allow future teachers (and practicing teachers alike) to establish a base in comparison regarding definitions used in assessment practices.  Individuals can then evaluate what ""matters most"" to a classroom teacher and to an institution.<",4
0,A quality site. I will be referncing this as I build my rubrics for next year's teaching assignment. ,4
1,"This is an well organized and easy to navigate collection of lessons on genes, genomes and genetics. The quality of the text and figures is high, and there were easy links to a glossary.",5
1,"This material has a clear structure, is easy to navigate and is cut in slices which are easy to learn. It offers a wide variety of media and has for any learning style and learning level something to offer. Great Job!",5
1,"The Problem section in each concept is excellent. I will try to rework many of these as online quizzes for my class.
Personally, I think the apology for their role in the eugenics movement could be stronger.",5
1,"This resource offers a nice mix of text, images, animations, and videos. I could see this being a very nice supplemental resouce to help students reinforce what they are learning in the classroom.",4
1,Almost too much information. That's a good thing!,5
1,This site does a good job for learning about DNA from the beginning.Technical Remarks:This site requires java.,5
1,This is a great resource for learning genetics. Love the different levels of learning and how you can tailor the lessons based on what you are currently learning in the classroom,5
1,"There is a lot of information on this site, from reading materiasl to videos, animations, and supplementary links.  The information is clear and easy to understand. Just about any topic that you would want to cover in class concerning DNA and genetics is covered here, along with some extra interesting information. Technical Remarks:The videos and the animations both played on the school computers, which isn't always the case. ",5
1,This is a great website and I plan on using it in some of my future courses.,5
1,"I think this website is a great tool when it comes to introduicing the notion of genetics in middle or high school level. I particularly found interesting the various animations the use which is appropriate for middle school students. They also have practice problems for each concepts they introduce which is great to nail down the concept learned. As a teacher, this website will help me a lot in teaching Genetics and the notion of DNA which is sometime very abstract for younger kids to grasp.",4
1,This is a very useful site for a gen ed biology course.,4
1,wow great videos!! I have included them in my into to biology class,5
1,All I can say is wow.  I am not a biologist but this made understanding DNA very easy for me.  I will recommend this to my students that are also enrolled in genetics.,5
1,I will use this material when we get to the genetics portion of the class.  I think it will help the students to visualize some of the processes we talk about.,4
1,"I find this clear, easy to follow and interesting.  I will definitely incorporate this into my next genetics moduleTechnical Remarks:Sometimes difficult to navigate simply because of the wealth of choices.",5
1,"I have not used this particular site, but have taught the classical genetics material in classes. If you cannot have students actively doing the studies with each other face-to-face, this is the next best thing! Individuals can interact intelligently with the material and it would be an excellent supplement to pairs or small group investigations. The problems require clear critical thinking.",5
1,"I recommend this to any beginning genetics students.  The information is presented in a clear, organized approach with an animated design.  This maintains attention while covering history and theories that could otherwise become dry topics for discussion.",5
1,"I really liked the organization of the the website, the toolbar on the right side was very useful in making navigation simple. I like that the information was provided in small chunks and was simple to understand. I also liked that there was not only text to read, but there were videos and animations as well.Technical Remarks:I did not encounter and technical issues.",4
1,This site provides simple animations and explanations along with a nice mixture of text and video.,3
1,"The thing that I like most about the website, is that it is very simple looking and provides information in small chunks.  I felt that as I went through the activities, questions that came up in my mind where answered on the next slide.  In other words, it seemed really natural.  I can see using this site as homework for students and for lesson plan ideas, I probably wouldn't use it during class though.Technical Remarks:It is a basic webpage.  Does not require any installation of software, and is free.",5
1,"I love this resource because it covers many different topics related to DNA. There is everything from Mendel's pea plants, to chromosomes, to the structure of DNA. I liked this aspect since it could be used in many different lessons on DNA or genes and will have specific information for the topic that is being studied. I also liked the information on the scientists that studied the particular aspect of DNA. It is a fun way to integrate the history of science into the curriculum. It would have been even more useful if some of the scientists had a little bit more information on them, instead of just their names and pictures. Some were explained in greater length, but not all.
I didn't particularly like the organization of the site. I am happy and excited for the multitude of topics, but it was a little overwhelming as I was looking at the different topics. The topics were not organized in a usable way that teachers or students could easily locate the topic they want to learn about. It would be more useful if the topics were under subtopics of more general titles, so that the information that was needed could be more easily located. If a teacher were to use one of the pages for a lesson, they would have to look through all of the topics first to find the one that works best with the lesson. Once they found the right topic, it would be great for the student to explore, it would just be time consuming to actually locate that topic that would work with your lesson.Technical Remarks:I loved the animation that was used throughout the site. I think that it would keep students interested in the information and make  the information more comprehensible. Any demonstrations like the ones on the site, help science come alive for students and give them a more concrete visual for science procedures and concepts. This type of resource would be especially useful for visual learners.",4
1,"This a great resource. There are tons of visuals and animations that can be very beneficial to students. It is broken up into three sections: Classical Genetics, Molecules of Genetics, and Genetic Organization. Within each section there are 10-15 subsections that all include Concepts, Animation, Gallery/Images, Audio/Video, Bio, and Problems. This resource thoroughly explains concepts and provides great visuals for students.",4
1,This is one of the better pages I've came across! Very informative and interesting!Technical Remarks:This site is awesome! Has tons of multimedia to help anyone understand more about DNA. Big font makes it easier to read.,5
1,I very much enjoyed moving through the various sections in this material. The organization was well thought out and the navigation was quite easy. Well done!Technical Remarks:I appreciate all the variation. Some on-screen reading was provided. Some animation was provided. Some videos were provided. Some interaction was presented. Well done!,5
1,The animation of DNA is clear and good to drescripe,5
1,"outstanding - timeless, simple, and effective",5
1,"Lots of information. Teacher can use it to pull information. Older students can handle the site. Lots of reading.

The right side could be organized better, the font is too small.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate. Links open in new window. Video clips open on site page.",4
1,"I recommend this site to all teachers.  It was very thorough and students of all ages were able to grasp the concepts.  I especially liked the short, but information packed, dialogues.Technical Remarks:I found it easy to use.",5
1,"I spent about a half an hour reviewing the DNA from the beginnings presentation tool.  I found it to be interesting yet informative. 
I thought the content was well presented in a fashion which made it easier to learn.  This tool used animation, video, and sound to create a learning environment which is conducive to all learning styles. 
The site ran quickly and smoothly and without error.  I would recommend to anyone trying to give a visual representation of DNA to a high school class.Technical Remarks:This tool was extremely easy to navigate through.  It would be ok for a beginner/novice to use the tool in the classroom setting.",5
1,"Hi to all the other members.My classes and i find it to be helpful in many ways.One thing i have to say if your child or students have trouble with physics,genetics,biology,..Get this book!It keeps the focus and it is simple.Technical Remarks:The book needs more of a ""mature foundation"".Simply meaning that it needs to be something more.It is still a good book",3
1,I am planning to get this for my up and coming Genetics Class. I hear it is a great source for reference on anything regarding Genetics.,5
1,this is really really useful.I felt genetics very intresting after entering the site.thanks to the submitter.!!,5
1,Ive always been interested in genetics and this website is a fun way to review and learn new things related to that topic. The animations and problems are great interactive devices to allow one to think about what is being presented. The audio visual interviews presented many  facts in a way that is more interesting and fun than just reading.,5
1,I enjoyed the visual DNA graphics. It tends to allow you to enjoy what you're learning much easier than writing on paper. Thanks!,5
1,This site offered great animation and clear instructions.  The site ran quickly and with out error.  This is a great tool for any upper level highschool science teacher and a great resource for students to use.,4
1,"This website is easy to use and has very quick animation.  I feel that it would be a great aid in a high school biology class or at the college level.  i thought that the set up of the website, makes it easy to find what you are looking for in genetics, DNA, or general questions.  The graphics make it very easy to understand the piont of the animation.   ",5
1,"Excellent. Great graphics, easy to understand and use. ",5
1,Outstanding graphics and in depth portrayals of topics. A powerful learning device for novice and expert alike.,5
1,"Excellent material, very comprehensive and useful.It is as good as it is even ""addictive"": you can not stop learning.The content is very well organized and it is very easy to use it.Technical Remarks: Quick animations. Fairly good design although some drawings sould be improved (a very very minor fault, and based in my personal opinion).",5
1,"I am a fourth year college student.  I was instructed by my college professor to join merlot and to review three websites and pick my favorite.  This was my selection.I feel this website was of the highest quality.  It provided a vast array of information in an enjoyable manner.  The webpages were setup in such a way that you don't realize how much you are learning until you have completed the ""lesson"".  I am currently taking a genetics course at South Dakota State University, and we have or are currently covering many of these topics.  I found it much more effective to ""view"" the experiments rather than merely hear about them.  The videos and sound were excellent and I appreciated the animation allowing me to move at my own pace.  I was not forced to move through too quickly, or drug along for a long ride.I believe this site would be beneficial to any student who learns well by seeing and hearing the topic in pictures and sound simultaneously.I found this site to be extremely easy to navigate.  The side menu options are always the best way to go.  I appreciated being able to select the next topic quickly.  I also thought the tabs on the bottom of the page which allowed the selection of different functions without using the ""back"" button were efficient.",5
1,"I reviewed this site for about an hour initially, then returned to it to plan how to use it in my general biology classes. I plan to use it in March.Quality of Content: 	Comprehensive, accurateinformation from classical genetics to today?s advances in molecular genetics. The credibility of the source, the DNA Learning Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Lab, insures that learner that the information is ?first hand? and accurate.  Much of the content is presented by the actual researchers (primary sources) and reflects therealism of day-to-day lab research conducted by real people.  Wonderful historical reflection on DNA research as well as today?s progress.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching-Learning Tool:	This source addresses a variety of leaning styles by using tutorials, explanation of terms, audio/visual,animations, and interaction during the problem phase. The links are helpful to instructors and/or serve as a springboard for student reflections or projects on thetopic.  The information is presented in ways that are relevant to learners and the problem-solving approach helps learners advance to a higher level of learning and reasoning.  This approach leads to more meaningful learning than just memorization.  The lessons teach forunderstanding.  These activities also expose learners to real science and the people who have contributed to our knowledge of DNA.  They show that science is a means ofproblem solving that can be applied to other contexts.An index of content could be helpful, especially for students who are unfamiliar with the content.  If it ould be more interactive (not just tutorial) the learners could be more involved.  Ease of Use: 	No problems here.  It was very well organized and the format was consistent.  Learners can focus on the content and not be bogged down with navigation issues.

1,"I use this site when teaching a sophomore core course in cell and molecular biology.  The tutorials and assignments that animate classical experiments, such as the Griffith transformation, Hershey & Chase and the Meselson & Stahl experiments are excellent.  Using them in a classroom setting allowed me to cover the material in one half the ususal time, and allowed me to ask more thought provoking questions on the exam.  Students seemed to comprehend the experimental designs faster and better, and commented very positively on the supplemental use of this site.",5
2,Very helpful site as it includes cultural information as well as language.,5
2,Provides video and an explanation of daily tasks in different languages and from a variety of cultural perspectives. Very useful in beginning language instruction.,4
2,"Good site for students to hear various Spanish speakers from various countries. Teachers need to review and select videos prior to student use.Technical Remarks:easy to navigate, good video",4
2,"This website houses an archive of very short media clips that run from approximately 10 - 30 seconds each.  The clips are of daily situations: going to the pharmacy, taking a taxi, saying hello to a friend on the street, and so on, and would be great to supplement materials being learned in class and/or to highlight different accents between countries and even within countries.",5
2,"Very effective for basic knowledge of languages.
It is an interesting material because it is always possible to compare language amd culture in overworld wide vision.Technical Remarks:Very quick and easy to use.",5
2,"This website provided a lot of information from a lot of different languages. If I were to pursue languages for a teaching subject, I would definitely come back to this site and use it to its full extent.",4
2,"As a future language teacher, I found this website very helpful. There are several languages covered on this site. I know I often have a hard time finding websites which will pertain to my subject matter, but this site tries to accomodate as many people and interests as possible.For each language ther are several themes discussed which include activites. There are pictures and videos to engage students and to promote a more hands on approach to learning a language. I personally found this site to be very welcoming and easy to use.Technical Remarks:I found the videos and links very easy to use.",4
2,"This course covers beginning and intermediate learners and focuses on listening, reading, speaking and writing. It offers a wide collection of authentic audio and video files from different Arabic countries. Some of the audio and video files are accompanied by English transcripts available in MS and PDF format. In addition there are 101 grammar rules that cover all basics grammatical concepts.",5
2,"This is a very useful website.
Though it doesn't have abundance of materials, it uses all the multimedia materials.
It is good in the sense that it provides good examples of how to use them.Technical Remarks:Instead of making the users download the multimedia files, embedding them in the web would have been much better... by using Flash or something like that.",5
2,"I'm a student at CSUMB now, but I'm still teaching language in the classroom, and I have used this site in the classroom. Students seem to really enjoy it, and i am impressed with the integration of video, and the inclusion of the transripts along with them. A well done site.Technical Remarks:This site requires you to have RealPlayer installed on your computer or an audio player that will play .ram files.",5
2,"Teaching and learning of foreign language does not require only to acquire certain amount of words, phrases or speaking at certain level. Body language is extremly important and it goes along with spoken language. Foreigner who speaks target language will be understood and accepted by natives much better if such pesron shows certain level of body language. Expression of respect, or love varies from language to language. For example when I try to say to my wife ""I love you"" in English, I really do not feel much of love, and perhaps I do not show it neither. This URL is very valuable for those who learn language using media or through colborative learning. Along with learning of pronunciation of sounds, phrases, or speaking at any level, these video clips show what body language goes with spoken language.Technical Remarks:I have feeling that some of characters are a little bit shay in front of cameras, which significantly decreases their natural performances.",5
2,"This site provides the authentic video, audio, and pictures from 35 countries in 25 languages. The materials cover practical topics such as greetings, family, travel, transportation, and shopping, etc. It contains strong cultural content and English transcripts. 
I like the format of this course as it categorized the learning dialogs in different topic, each topic has a link to the video and script file, plus vocab. Viewers can hear and see the dialogs in their own pace. Hope that this course will include more languages in the future. I can adapt the format to create my web course in my school.Technical Remarks:It is simple and easy to use!",4
2,"This is a great website with numerous short video clips, photos and written material addressing culture and different other issues that every language learner needs to know and pay attention to. I like the fact that the clips are short and ?down to the point?.  As a language teacher, I noticed that students get overwhelmed with ?too much spoken language?, especially at the early stages of learning a second language. I also like the fact that all video clips are accompanied with a target language transcript and English translation. I personally used Croatian and Serbian materials, and students really enjoyed seeing authentic settings, pictures, language, and cultural messages that came with it.Technical Remarks:The site is user friendly and is very simple to navigate. 
Some of the sounds might need improvement.",4
3,the ability that this site has to use 2d and 3d examples right in front of you helped to get a better understanding of the graph. being able to see it from all angles helps to figure all possibilities.Technical Remarks:very many tools to use in many different ways to solve many problems.,4
3,"I have reviewed the material at Merlot.org over the past few months now after being introduced to the site by my instructor.  I believe it to be an awesome resource.  Yes, I do believe that the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant.  Additionally, the potential effectiveness for enhancing the learning process I found to be significant.  I found the material and the website to be user friendly, however, at a quick glance it would appear crowded with information and necessary to focus on each point specifically without a general overview present.Thanks,Bryan M. Woods",5
3,I looked over this website that had a lot of informational reading with some examples to look at. Not much interaction is envolved in this website but it was definatly educational and easy to follow. ,3
3,"This has been one of the best graphing programs I've seen so far. The software covers a variety of mathematical fields, especially calculus and differential equations. This can be used both in class and at home for students who want to explore more about Math and Physics.Technical Remarks:It takes a little bit of time to get accustomed to this program. However, the interface is friendly, easy to use. Plus, all the questions are answered in detail in the help section.",4
3,i spent about 10 minutes looking at this program. the program is nice because it is simple to use.students and teacgers can use this software because it helps people in different math categories.,4
3,"I spent about 10 minutes reviewing it. It seemed to have a lot of valuable math applications ready to go for you, for all types of math levels ranging from root finding to vector plotting; no idea what these things are, of course. I think it'd be useful for teachers in classrooms who can use it to enhance student learning who are visual learners. The tools are there,  for ex. to manipulate a curve at the press of a button so the student sees the concept relating to the visual.",4
3,"I found MVT to be very useful for many different problems and applications.  As a teaching tool this would be very effective for a high school to college level math student.  Great for someone who knows computer language.Technical Remarks:The problem with MVT is its plotting system, when plotting certain graphs it seemed to be inaccurate.  The software is also a little hard to use when trying to plot more difficult equations.",4
3,"well organised and usefull, lacks in user friendliness but generally recommended",4
3,"I found Mathematical Visualization Tool very helpful for many different problems and applications. It would be an effective teaching tool for all math levels. It makes the student understand the different between 1D, 2D and 3D.",4
3,"This is an excellent online graphing utility.  This software can be utilized from the basic math courses all the way up to the very intermediate math courses.  However, there may need to be some directions included on how to effectively use the utility.  Nevertheless, the help section gives very detailed explanations.  Overall, the end user aspect is user friendly. ",4
3,It looks great and also very useful for people for people who can benefit from this tool.,5
3,"Is interesting, easy to use and has many resources",4
3,"It was somewhat easy to use on problems.But it was more useful for many problems.I think any level of math would be very useful with this.It teachers use this, they will surely learn more effectivley. First time users shouldnt feel that uncomfortable wiht it, as for me it was quite easy.Technical Remarks:I really like this one.",3
3,I enjoyed interacting with the 3D function plot. I moved it and twisted it in so many ways. I even pushed some of the buttons that made it transform it's state of being. It got me curious on what else I could click on to find out how math can entertain me. Math isn't my strong suit. But being able to manipulate what was presented to me at first was fun and educational.Technical Remarks:Having to click on the object and hold down to move the object any which way I could was amazing and had me wanting more. But I wanted to give my comment in so others can definitely and substantially know that this is a site to visit and learn from.,5
4,"Great educational website, numerous collection of links with learning activities regarding the nervous system. Diverse learning activities presented including, reading material, creative projects, experiments, games, and teaching lesson plans. The website is informative providing logical information and examples of projects and classroom activities for teachers to use as hands-on- activities. It also has a diverse amount of information for students or parents to access for fun activity time.The website has activities for a variety of learning levels, learning styles and a variety of age levels.           Technical Remarks:It was easy to navigate and find information related to specific topics in neuroscience. ",5
4,Great set of materials that can be used in lecture notes or as the basis for a project.,5
4,The site was very interactive and had a wide assortment of different activites for different levels of learning. I liked that the site featured questions from different students.,5
4,"This Web site recently won the Science magazine SPORE award.This has something for everyone, from a kindergarten student to an undergraduate.  In fact, my only issue with this Web site is that the title makes it seem that undergraduate wouldn't be interested. This Web site also includes a monthly newsletter that keeps you up to date on changes made to the Web site, but also on news articles pertaining to neuroscience and any other points of interest in the field.",5
4,This website contains a lot of useful information on the neuroscience. I would like to use some information and games on the lecture of nerve system in living environment class. The Q and A section has wonderful information for teachers to plan the lesson. I spend more than an hour to browse this site. I think this website is mainly for teacher not for students. I love the brain games section especially the “Brain Hieroglyphics”. By playing that game students will definitely remember the vocabularies relate to the neuroscience.,5
4,"I have not used this resource in the classroom yet, but will. I teach brain-based graduate education leadership, to teachers, principals, and superintendents. They will love this resource! This is a very thorough Web site that links to many significant sources and age appropriate.Technical Remarks:This Web site was easy to navigate, and the links provided to ""sister"" or related sites were also easy to link to and relative to this age group! 
Excellent resource!",5
4,This is an excellent resource to spark young student's interests in the nervous system. Great interactive resources for learning!,4
4,"I liked the colorful pictures and the Q and A section. This seems to be a Web site of resources more than a teaching or lesson-based site, but provides good supplemental material.",4
4,I love this website.  I have used a lot of the information in my Introduction to Psych 201 course.  It provides easy to understand  explanations of some technical concepts.  We made the pipe cleaner neurons in class and everyone loved it!,5
4,"This is a terrific site. It is engaging and challenging.  Some of the q & a were pretty sophisticated and might benefit from a little example or illustration, but",5
4,"This is a wonderful website, utilizing experimentation and exploration in the classroom.  I thought that the information provided was educationally significant and would aide in the broadening of young minds.  I also liked that there are up-to-date information sections that can keep people interested in what is happening on a daily basis.  There is always something new to learn on this website.",4
4,"I thought this was an interesting website with a lot of great information.  The reason I stopped short of giving it five stars rests in its organization.  The website says that it is for teachers and students and in fact appears to be, but some sites seemed to be aimed at one group more than the other.  The organization does not however tell you which sites are intended for which audiences.  An organized teacher could gain a lot of information and demonstration from the ideas, but a child might become flustered if they are using the site and have problems finding information they can relate to.  I would recommend this website for any teacher to study before teaching on the subject of neuroscience, but make sure you find specific websites on it for your younger students and do not expect them to be able to explore it on their own.",4
4,"This is very engaging. I am not a specialist in the field, but I did have some reservations about the section on Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. This could be potentially upsetting for children who exhibit any of the freatures which are depicted. Also, it fails to recognise that this is an uncertain area in terms of recent research.",4
4,I was on the site for a total of 20 minutes and really enjoyed the site.  I found most of the information to be very direct and well said.  This site is very good for kids especially those with burning questions.  I will be keeping this site in mind when I start teaching in my own classroomTechnical Remarks: The website was very fun to look at which is very important in todays childern.  With all the games and vertual reality things avalable its nice to see such a well designed website directed to students. ,5
4,"I navigated this site for a total of 96 minutes and was very pleased with the results. This site is directed toward many age levels and could be used in the classroom by students ranging from the elementary level to the high school level. This site helps the user develop the key concepts in neuroscience and employs interesting and fun ways to explore the dynamics of the field by providing interactive experiments, charts, and illustrations. This site is obviously designed for students at a higher reading level, as some of the information is somewhat extensive. However, for the most part, this site could easily be adapted for use by younger students through teacher guidance and instruction, as it provides clear and concrete illustrations and entertaining demonstrations  to help students develop the basic concepts of neuroscience. Although I did not use this site in a classroom, I believe it could easily be adapted for use in a classroom and could be a very useful tool that teachers could use to introduce the basic ideas found in the field of neuroscience, which would more than likely prompt students to want to find more infromation within the field on their own.Technical Remarks: This site is well organized and is very specific, breaking down topics into many subcategories that could be focused on by the instructor if used in a classroom. The site is easy to navigate as well. The use of color and entertaining photos also make the site asthetically pleasing and would definitely draw the interest of younger students who use the site.",5
4,"I feel that this site has enormous potential as a teaching tool.  I found that the site was easy to navigate so that even younger students would have no problems using it.  There is just a ton of information here and there are unlimited possibilities for lessons that can be devised from the material on this site.  I also feel that this site is great because not only can college age kids find something they are interested in, but I think that junior high and high school students would have no problems navigating this site and using it to their advantage.  I spent about 1 hour surfing this site and still didn't get to most of it.  I will definetely recommend this site to my students and will use it to incorporate a technological side to my lessons on neurological processes.  Technical Remarks: I found that this site was extremely easy to navigate.  I had no problems and the pages were quick to pop up.  There are also a lot of great extra activities at the bottom of many pages.  I think the illustrations are helpful and the language is appropriate for various age groups.",5
4,"I took three settings to go through at least 1 link for each of the the 13 parts of the resource.  I thought the content, presentation, activities and potential effectiveness were excellent.  The way information was arranged and presented was user friendly and I was able to easily move within the web page.Technical Remarks:This is covered in my general remarks, but again I want to say how teacher friendly and student friendly this site is.",5
4,"This is a wonderful, informative website!  I spent time reviewing it to help refresh my memory before completing a unit on the brain.  Also, I shared some of the activities with my teacher and classmates at the time (Health in the Elementary Classroom).  I think that some older elementary and even middle school students would enjoy reviewing the website themselves. ",5
4,I spent a number of hours looking over and reviewing the information provided on this site.  I found that the information provided would be helpful to both students and teachers.  As an educator the activities and lesson ideas were very appealing.  Children would be drawn in and would gain termendous knowledge about the nervous system by it.Technical Remarks: The site was very eye-appealling.  It was also very easy to navagate for a first time user.  It would be a site that I would come back to often.,5
4,This is an awesome website.  Very easy to navigate and a great resourse from kids to adult.,5
4,This is a great web site.Technical Remarks:> I spent about an hour reviewing this web site.  The material on this web site was easy to read and very eay to understand.  The information that I found here was just what I needed.  Thank You,5
4,"I found this website to be very interesting in that it breaks down into sections the different ways to look at neuroscience and how to teach children about it. I believe that this site allows for learning about a subject that may sound terrifying but if applied in the right manner can be fun and educational at the same time.Technical Remarks: I think that the software allows for first time users a ""user friendly"" approach.  It didn't seem to complicated in accessing the imformation that you were looking for, may just going back might be a problem. AS for the merlot system I think it is a great learning and teaching tool, and the comments from users is a great idea to see how other people have viewed the material.",4
4,"Overall I was very impressed with this website. It is an excellent teaching and learning tool. The web page is bright and colorful and is well marked for easy navigation. There are thirteen main areas to investigate. It is a fun, interactive way for students (age 13-16) to learn about the brain. It also has a section called ""Resources for Teachers"" that helps to plan a lesson!Some highlights for students are the basic facts offered about the brain in trivia style. For example,the brain is made up of 100 billion neurons and weighs approximately 3 pounds.There are puzzles, brain games and reflex games. The reflex games include turning off the lights (sothat you pupils grow big), then turning them back on to time how long it takes for them to shrinkagain. There is another reflex game where students test each others knee jerk reflex. I think thegames are significant, because they teach real concepts by doing.There is also a section on a drawing contest, a free newsletter and a place to send a card. This webpage also has a section where you can make notes and e-mail it to yourself.I highly recommend the web page as a must for any student learning about the brain in the 13-16 agegroup. It is also a must for any biology or health instructor teaching this age group about the brain. Itwould be an excellent source of fun homework for students. In other words, sending them to theweb page to learn about the Stroop Effect. It is a fun game. Try it. Some older students could utilizethe web page, but might find it 'kiddish'.MercyTechnical Remarks: Great color and interest.  Easy to navigate.",5
5,"I link to this site in my Introduction to Physical Anthropology class during the primatology component to let students explore the relationship between osteology and taxonomy. 
The detail of the pictures is excellent.",5
5,Good resource for comparative anatomy.,4
5,"Awesome learning tool for the students, would need teacher scaffolding.Technical Remarks:Excellent graphics, easy to navigate.",5
5," I have been using this site as a student for years.  As a teacher, it is well organized and easy to navigate.  Furthermore, images of the bones are easily captured for incorporating into worksheets or PowerPoint presentations.  A great resource to find uniform images of bones. ",4
5,"This tool was incredibly useful in not only explaining, but showing the similarities and differences in human bones and other animals. In terms of understanding evolution, it drives home the idea that we all came from one similar ancestor.Technical Remarks:This website was very unique in that it allowed one to look at particular bones from six different angles. It allowed me to really see the similarities and differences. I also found the site very easy to navigate. Most importantly, the site made learning about bones fun, interactive, and interesting.",5
5,"I was highly impressed with this site. It allows the viewers to see bones in a very realistic way, from different angles and views, and compare the bones to different specimens. Since it would be very difficult to get the array of bones represented in this site present in a classroom, the site allows students to interact with many different kinds of bones that wouldn't be available to them in real life.
I especially like the comparative feature on the site. It would be very useful in a lesson on the evolution of mammals, and would allow students to see the similarities and differences between the bones of different mammals.
This site would be very useful as a supplementary resource for a lesson and would allow students to navigate at their own pace, as well as investigate bones and comparisons of bones that they are interested in. There are many different bones to choose from, so students would have many choices and be able to see many different kinds of bones.
I would also be able to use this site for the students to learn the names of the different bones. It is different to learn the name of a bone and point to it on your body compared to seeing the actual bone, from all different angles. Seeing the bone would allow visual learners to connect that image to the name, and see the same bone in different mammals. The site would appeal to other learners as well, since there is a lot of interaction and options for students to explore anatomy.
I think this site is very useful for teachers and students in the study of anatomy and would benefit many different types of users. Even as I was navigating, I kept saying ""Wow"" out loud because it really gives you a picture of what our bones look like inside our body. I have never experienced that before and look forward to sharing it with my students someday.Technical Remarks:Everything was very easy to navigate through and could be easily used by a student or teacher. A teacher could also easily give directions to a student to go to specific bones and look at specific information. A student could also easily explore on his or her own and learn about the bones they are interested in or having trouble learning the names of. Everything was organized in a logical way and a user wouldn't have trouble finding the information they needed to find.",5
5,"This resource will complement an introductory anatomy class nicely.  Uses HTML so the materials are easily accessible, no plugins needed.",4
5,A very good source on comparitive anotomy,4
5,great pictures. perfect for compare/contrast activity.,4
5,"Good for anatomy or zoology, good for comparative anatomy. Provides detailed pictures of individual bones in multiple views.",4
5,This is really neat for students to have a comparison between animals. This is also great as more schools add a physiology and anatomy course.,5
5,Wow! I have never seen anything like this! Very sophisticated.Technical Remarks:Confusing at first...User might need to be kind of proficient...,5
5,"This is truly an amazing resource! There is a clear statment of mission and very sophisticated technology and taxonomies are used in an interactive flash card approach that allows the user to drill down for more information and also compare objects to one another. 

This site is truly impressive.",5
5,"This would be an excellent resource for teachers who do not have access to actual or replicated primate bones and/or articulated skeletons. For students, this site provides incredibly detailed photographs of bones from a variety of views. In addition it allows the student to make side-by-side comparison of primate bone structures. This allows the teacher to assign homework using this site rather than printed texts which usually do not have the kind of detail needed for comparative an anatomy.",5
5,As I went through this website I found it very easy to use and very helpful.  It was easy to find specific bones in an array of different types of skeletons; which were all sorted for the viewer.  The site allowed you to find a specific bone in a pull down menu and then would open a new page with an in depth and close up picture of the bone.  It also allowed you to view the bone from different angles and perspectives.  This site also provided the user with a glossary and a help section which were very useful.  Overall the site would be very useful in any anatomy or biology lesson or class.Technical Remarks: This site was easily navigable with the help of color coded scroll down menu and colorfully highlighted links.  The format of the site was organized in a helpful manner.,5
5,"I looked through the website and spent time trying different things. I think that this website is easy for people to navigate through and answers your questions. The glossary is very nice to have, so you can look up the things you don't know. Also, it is interactive and can keep students interested while they are learning.",4
5,I thoroughly looked over the website and found it to be a very useful website.  It had a glossary where definations of many bones could be found.  It also showed the bones of several animals.  It labelled all the bones and located them.  I found this website extremely useful in teaching units on bones.  Students could go to this website and be active when exploring the different bones.  I think this will help to engage the students in active learning which will make them learn more.  The website is easy to figure out how to use.,5
5,I think that this website offers a great deal of virtual information.  It allows an uninformed user like myself to easily navigate and compare the different skeletal stuctures.  I would definitly recommend this for any anatomy/physiology class.  I spent about 15 minutes comparing different bone structures.  The quality of the content was very well organized and informative.  The user is easily able to compare skeletal structures without ever touching the skeleton itself.  A website of this sort can enhance any user a great amount.  This website represents the growing process of the virtual learning environment.  Technical Remarks: Technically this website is easily navigable for the beginning users.  It offers complex terminology and compelling diagrams that a new user can understand.  This site also allows the users to navigate similar websites through hot links.  It also permits us to use a glossary to help define scientific terminology that users might not comprehend.  Overall this site can greatly improve the knowledge of its users by using comparitive structures and through definitions.  ,5
5,"I found this site to be very easy to use,informative and very interactive. It has very good images. I feel it would be a strong addition for anatomy or evolution studies.Technical Remarks: Technically this site is very user friendly and yet offer a lot of high quality images.",5
5,"I really enjoyed this website.  It was very easy to find,easy to use, and the quality of both the information and the  pictures was fantastic. This resources would be beneficial to anyone studying anatomy.",5
6,"SAMPLE:  As a student, I always found labs boring because it was just following the same directions.  WIth Virtual Chem Lab, I was able to test ideas on my own without running out of time or worrying about making mistakes.",5
6,"I didn’t do the tutorial, just jumped right in.  Consequently I couldn’t do much of anything.  Before sending students to complete a lab in this simulator, they will definitely need to complete a tutorial.  Note that the java-based program wouldn’t work properly in my Firefox browser, but ran just fine in Chrome.  I am disappointed that the tool that allows teachers to construct a lab is currently being “revamped,” but I will keep checking back.  This could be a great supplemental tool to check in on a student’s theoretical lab understanding, maybe even as homework.  But I imagine even the authors would agree that no simulation can replace actual lab time.  One awesome feature that the site has is the tutorial feature that allows students to complete problems with guided help.  The learning curve to work in the tutorial mode appears to be far less steep than that of performing a virtual lab.",4
6,This is an excellent resource for upcoming teachers. I am really impressed with the amount of free information and presentations found on the site. ,5
6,"Although it took me a while to figure it out, this one will definitely be recommended for the course I'm helping to develop.",4
6,"Remarkable simulation of a chemistry laboratory. You can use virtual solutions and get the same results that a real laboratory. Presents information of molarity, ph meter and component of the solutions.",5
6,I will definitely use this in the future with my teacher candidates. Excellent tool for schools that don't have a lot of equipment and chemicals.,4
6,"I think this could be a good lab for instructors and their students to use before the actual lab day.  There does seem to be a bit of a learning curve with doing this, so I'd make sure to tell students to view the tutorial AND to take notes.Technical Remarks:Tutorial does go quickly, perhaps a download version of the script/directions would help?",3
6,very good material,5
6,This is an awesome site. I am in the Education Program right now and I would love this and I'm going to send my sister here.Technical Remarks:One imporvement would be to allow for students to write labels on the glassware. That is a habit that needs reinforcing.,5
6,"1. How did you review the materials? (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing or 2 hours trying it?)

Spent about 30 minutes browsing site and performed simple titration lab using HCL and NaOH with Phenolphthalein as indicator (using Buret).

2.  The quality of content. (Do the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?)

The handling of the lab equipment is straight forward and the array of reagents (mostly acids and bases and indicators) provide for the development of a variety of labs on acids, bases, neutralization, indicators, conjugate bases & acids, as well as possible experiments on dilution of acids & bases, and formation of precipitates.  Also, the presence of the thermometer and Log of the different ions provides a good tool to teach exothermic reactions between acids and bases as well as the time course of the changes of various ions during the chemical reaction process.

I think a brief tutorial is necessary to have students get accustomed to the workshop, using the mouse to gather and handle equipment and reagents, as well as become familiar with the lab bench and pH meter and other log based read outs.

3.  The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning. (If used appropriately, will students learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?)

If used properly, this lab would be very useful in understanding the various lab techniques as well as principles of pH scale and neutralization.

I would highly recommend it for online courses or as a practice run prior to having students actually use acids and bases in a real laboratory setting.  If properly used as a lab simulator, it could reduce the risks of lab accidents with acids and bases in real laboratory situations.

4. Technical Remarks: Specifically address the following issue:
5.  The ease of using the materials.  (Will first time users fine it easy to use?)

Students will need to have Java applet plug-in present.  Before students go to this site, it is suggested that they be referred to www.java.com; test if the have Java, and download the plug-in if they do not.  Also, it helps if this is an online course to notify the Tech Help Desk that they may need to assist newer students in downloading the Java plug-in.  But, it is STRONGLY urged that any course using this site have a technology requirement (listed in the syllabus) that the student computer already have Java plug-in present.

I think a brief tutorial is necessary to have students get accustomed to the workshop, using the mouse to gather and handle equipment and reagents, as well as become familiar with the lab bench and pH meter, temperature, and other log based read outs of ions and presence of gases and solids (e.g. precipitate).

One suggestion is a demonstration and then a test lab where student just manipulate the stock bottles to make dilutions of acids and bases (both weak and strong) and read the resultant changes in pH.  Also, one other training exercise is to have students fill a beaker from a stock container to get used to the select as source and select as recipient settings.Technical Remarks:Students will need to have Java applet plug-in present.

7,What an excellent resource. I think  that it is refreshing that people still take the time to build something like this in the face of standardized testing. Bravo!Technical Remarks:Surprisingly easy to navigate. Searchable too.,5
8,The material has a lot of information about mitochondria. cool.Technical Remarks:There weren't any technical requirements for the material.,5
9,"Interesting, text-heavy simulation about the Crisis at Fort Sumter. Users should be notified about the text-heavy nature and small size of the videos that display on the screen. ",4
9,I really liked the use of the calendars to show the time frame of events as well as the use of the Notebook page for students to answer the questions.Technical Remarks:I found it a bit hard to read with the background texture.,5
9,"Nicely done; I lived in the area as a child and this was a great review of the history lessons in school. I like the video snippets, although mine displayed very badly; that could be a local issue though. The embedded links for more details on significant figures were a nice addition. I can see this being quite useful at the middle and high school level where history is a tough subject for students to absorb and remain interested in studying.",4
9,"Lots of fascinating information provided. Not my area of expertise, but very interesting, nonetheless.Technical Remarks:Fairly easy to navigate. Need to use the ""back"" button to get back to the material after selecting a link; otherwise fine.",5
9,"It is a good assignent, though it is outside my area of expertise.  Nice interaction to get the student involved.",4
10,"I plan to implement it with my education students, I think we can learn a lot and get a lot out of it.",5
10,"I spent about 90 minutes reviewing this site and experimenting with it to design an assessment instrument.This site helps instructors to design and administer web-based course assessments.  The site provides users with a simple online tool for assessing their students? impressions of their courses and their teaching.  Instructors can then open a proactive dialogue with students about teaching, the course, and the entire learning process.  An immediate benefit of this is that it integrates assessment as a formative process throughout the delivery of the course so that changes can be made immediately--during the course--to benefit the students who are giving the feedback, rather than receiving feedback after the course is completed.The program is easy for instructors to administer and easy for students to use. It allows students to contribute their feedback anonymously.  It provides a graphic summary of results.",5
10,"I found this site very helpful.  I spent approximately 1 hour (shorter if on T3 line) setting up a four-question survey for one of my courses.  The students found it easy to respond.  The quality of the data obtained is, or course, related to the quality of the survey questions generated.  That being said, the ANONYMOUS information that is generated is very valuable.  I would encourage others to set up the survey so that students can see what others have said.Technical Remarks:Finding a course is more difficult than it needs to be.  It is supposed to be alphabetical, but that isn't apparent.  Finding by instructor is even more time-consuming if your last name begins with a letter near the end of the alphabet.  A search function would help useability greatly.",4
10,"After reviewing this site, I can see how this can be use in online course evaluations.  I especially like the spreadsheets and report graphs that it generate.",4
10,"FAST is a great tool for creating online surveys, especially if you use questions from their own database.  Open ended questions are rather easy to create, but the creation of multiple choice or likert scale questions is more difficult because of the challenge of matching the question wording to the response choices.  There is now a tooFast in beta format that I have not yet tested.  

If you don't already have access to online survey tools, or want to ask more questions than is possible in Survey Monkey this seems to be a good option.  The availability of the question database is very helpful for those need ideas about the types of topics about which feedback should/could be obtained, or who need help with wording.Technical Remarks:fairly easy to use, and it seems to load pretty quickly via high speed internet.",4
11,A comprehensive resource about grammar; a bit text heavy.  Lots of great information. Could be a great resource tool for students.,4
11,"This is a great site with a lot of useful materials; however, over the past year, quizzes and presentations have stopped working, so it may not be maintained any longer.",4
11,"I found this website quite useful for writing teachers at college level. They could use this website as a resource when they prepare their lessons. There are many subtopics related to English grammar and writing tips. Teachers can choose from a large of pool of resources but sometimes I found reading so many entries from the dropdown menu and pick those I want was not always an easy job. 
Some links are no longer available.",4
11,This is a wonderful tool for teaching and learning grammar and writing. I will definitely return to this one.,5
11,"I could see using this for grammar mini-lessons in writing classes or secondary English classes. I wouldn't want to spend too much of my time using it -- grammar is best taught in context, after all -- but it provides some good quick look-up resources for students and teachers",4
11,"This is an excellent resource; however, in the section on vocabulary some links are dead with a bit of research needed to find their new homes. Other links for vocabulary do not represent the new words over the last ten years. Even a site for academic vocabulary was last updated in 2003 so newer terms such as multimodal and information literacy are not represented.   I do strongly recommend the sections on grammar and writing. This would be an excellent site for some eager soul to update.",3
11,The different electronic information is wonderful.   I could definitely use the different information in a computer lab setting or using an individual computer along with a projection screen.,5
11,"I have used and recommended this site to students who are either struggling with grammar concepts or require refreshers in specific areas.Technical Remarks:One word of caution.  Since this site drills down in grammar concepts and writing, the instructor should review and determine a path for the student(s)based on skill levels that are being studied. (Fundamentals, Composition I or II, etc.).",5
11,Wonderful resource.  Very user friendly.  The exercises are a nice touch.  I can see this being quite useful.,5
11,Short and clear: very good for students. Roll overs provide attention getting animation.Technical Remarks:Site well organized and user friendly.,5
11,"I've used this site as a tutorial in my basic writing courses. Students find it easy to use and helpful once they get the hang of it. It's also a great link for students to work from at home. Some students struggled a bit at first understanding how to move throughout the site, but with a bit of help, they were soon pros.

Students found the design fun and were eager to try it out, even if it was ""grammar."" They liked to compete with one another on certain assigned modules, or modules they explored on their own.

With my transfer-level writing courses, I've used this site for students who need some brushing up on grammar and usage. Again, it was ideal with this because they could do it on their own at home or in the writing center. If they got stuck, they asked me and we could work through it together.Technical Remarks:Students reported it easy to use and accessible.",4
11,"I have used the grammar and usage parts of this site in my classes for two or three years, and I have also spent several hours exploring its resources.  Its general title is accurate, because the site provides explanations, tutorials, and interactive exercises for a very wide range of grammar- and composition-related topics.  The explanations use traditional schoolroom grammar and terminology, but they assume minimal prior knowledge and they are informed by a sophisticated understanding of how language works.  Straight explanations are varied by PowerPoints, an ""Ask Grammar"" section, an FAQ, an extremely useful ""Notorious Confusables"" page, and various other resources.The site's design makes it easy for instructors to give students URLs for specific grammatical concepts and usage rules to be reviewed (or learned for the first time).  Clear explanations are followed by interactive exercises that illustrate the concepts and test students' understanding.  My honors composition students frequently report not only that they really like the immediate feedback but also that the first interactive exercise makes them more attentive to material they thought they understood.  Finding links to recommend is made simple by the site's search engine, index, and drop-down menus.Technical Remarks:The pages of the site, including the interactive exercises, work well and nearly always seem to be available.  The closest thing to a design problem I have encountered is having to retype, rather than cut and paste, when putting in a corrected sentence as an answer in some of the quizzes. Those who know what they want to look up will find the site relatively easy to use, although its size and complexity can make it hard to be sure one has found the best available section for the purpose.  My only reservation about the site's helpfulness for general users is that it may be hard to look up a rule if one does not know what an error is called--but that is a problem common to reference works on this subject.",5
11,"I spent time accessing sites for supplemental grammar exercises for my Basic Writing class at the university freshman level.  I used this site extensively for its fun, educational exercises dealing with pronoun case, adjectives and adverbs, and modifiers.  The materials were helpful for students as they contributed to what we had addressed in class.  Their learning was enhanced because they liked using the computer and said the exercises were better than doing in-class worksheets.  Technical Remarks: Students found the site easy to get to and to navigate.",5
12,"Like this practice page for students.  Moving through the exercies takes a little practice, but once students understand how to input answers if flows well.",4
12,I feel like this site would be a great site for middle school and high school students to practice math.,5
12,"I am impressed by what he offers.  There's something for everybody.  Good work, Larry.",5
12,"Larry Green's Applet Page rules! Once again, being lured in by the possibility of punching numbers and interacting, I spent a good 20 minutes browsing through the material. I even found an awesome game called ""Exponent Invaders""- like Space Invaders but uses exponent problems instead of aliens. Very fun!
Arcade games aside, the quality of content here is very relevant to intermediate algebra/college level math students. From basic math to statistics, there are interactive applets for many example mathematical situations.
This material absolutely has the potential to enhance learning across the spectrum for early math students. Using real time applets is an invaluable resource for the understanding of math. Especially when no one is around to help, there are hints available at each section of the equations which help the user to find the correct solutions.
Ease of use gets an A+ here. The site has a basic layout with suggested applet links without any distracting nonsense that takes away from the subject matter. Even Exponent Invaders is based on math!
I highly recommend Larry Greens Applet Page!",5
12,"This page has game and practice exercises. For me this is very good, because the students can practice the lessons.",4
12,This website offers a lot of interesting applications that can help students from basic math to statistics. It has interactive games and visual aids that can really help students to understand the concept. I played a few games and I had a lot of fun. An excellent site for students to have fun and learn at the same time.,4
12,"This website is very helpful. It covers a wide range of topics covering basic Math to statistics. The site provides a variety of mathematical concepts that will enhance your knowledge. I personally enjoyed the games and activities, and the visual aid for better comprehension. An Excellent reference for math review.",4
12,"Great site.  Very clear outline of topics listed on Larry Green's Applet Page.  Broad range of levels covering Basic Math to Beginning Algebra, Intermediate College Algebra and Statistics.Technical Remarks:You do need to download programs prior to actually participating the the games.",4
12,After reviewing this page for about 15 minutes. I was fascinated. This is a link that I would use for help. I think that the quality of this page shows a great detail of help. It has various sorts of links to be used for many different types a math. This would be very helpful to students that were needing help on homework or help in a specific area of math. This is something that I would consider using as a first time using. One because it is easily accessable and two because it will be beneficial to my mathematical skills.,5
12,very useful - great for review,5
12,"This particular webpage is VERY useful! I spent about 30 minuties clicking on the different applications that it offers. There's everything on there from basic math to statistics. There are numerous games and math activities that you can play with. The content within the site allows you to really understand math. There are instructions, examples, games, and diagrams that are presented in order to comprehend the lessons the site is teaching. I would use many of the games and examples in a classroom. They are an excellent visual aid. I think using this site as a teaching method is a great idea. It would give students the chance to read and then explore games as examples. It's a good hands on exercise. Faculty's teaching will definitely be enhanced. This site is perfect for lectures and activities in a classroom. The site was very simple and easy to use. However, logging on to MERLOW, and browsing for this particular site, I found somewhat difficult. It was difficult because I had to search for topics, and I wouldn't always necessarily come up with what I was looking for. Other than that, this site is highly recommended by me!",5
13,"Thanks you for this post, is really usefull the information.",4
13,Very complete information about each instrument detail. Includes drawings and sounds of instrument which are very helpful to understand it´s use.,4
13,Lacks interactivity,3
13,"Incredible site, explain very clear and dynamically how physics of sound works.",5
13,"This is an excellent site to see how physics and music are related.  It is very detailed and gives many examples. If someone is studying sound, it is a wonderful site to see demonstrations, including the mathematics and science behind sound. It is an excellent resource for anyone studying engineering, as well as music.Technical Remarks:This site does a wonderful job by using video, simulations and interactive exercises. ",5
13,Lots of interesting physics concepts on strange aspects of sound,5
13,A great site overall! Loved the section on guitar bracing geometries.,4
14,"This website contains a wealth of information, including interactive activities and engaging visuals to explain the material. I went with 4 rather than 5 stars because much of the information has not been updated recently. For example, many of the pages were last updated in Jan, 2004. The majority of the information is still correct and relevant, and it would be nice to have updated statistics on prevalence, incidence, etc. ",4
14,Perfect for people that do not know much about Osteoporosis. Great pictures and videos as well.,5
14,"This webquest designed tutorial is an outstanding resource for many levels of healthcare practitioners, students, and the lay public in formal and informal education settings.

It appeals to visual and auditory learners and has interactive components.Technical Remarks:Techinical requirements include flash and quick time player, current version of adobe.",5
14,"This site is a great learning tool! It is VERY descriptive and has many graphics and charts that further enhances the learning experience. It has an abundance of information including who is at risk for osteoporosis and how to prevent osteoporosis- information that a student nurse or other healtcare providers can give to their patients. This site incorporates appropriate information for the student, doctor, teacher, or person simply curious about osteoporosis.Technical Remarks: Very user friendly and well organized.",5
14,I spend an hour browsing the site and doing the assignments. They are very helpful not just for people with osteoporosis.  It is helpful for healthcare provders too.  The assignment is a good practice for knowing what to do for a pt when he or she has a certain diagnosis. If used correctly it can enhanced student's learning.  ,4
14,This site goes beyond basic osteoporosis information to include all bone matters.  Pictures and charts are well chosen/implemented and aid in holding attention while complementing material.  This site can be used to educate all age ranges.Technical Remarks: Pages load quickly and no apparent technical mistakes exist.,3
14,This site is a great find.  The slides and information was a learning experience.  Individuals of all ages can something about bone health and how to protect bone health.  I have assignments planned for my Infant and Chile Nutrition classes from this site.,5
14,This sight is informative about osteoporosis and is a good learning tool.  I would reccomend it.,4
15,"I have just identified this really neat game, so I have not had the opportunity to use it in a class yet; however, I definitely intend to when I get to the unit on public health in my health care systems course. This was very informative and FUN!Technical Remarks:Simple to use; a lot of fun; neat, personal interactions and animations",5
15,"I really like this game!
First of all, it shows the importance of collaboration between different professions (nurses, scientists, project managers, public health professionals)

Second, I learned about the detective work in fidning out the source of infection

Third, this game teaches critical thinking

Fourth, it is a very engaging tool useful for student nurses, nurses (nice relief from all t he lectures), and  a good course for the general public
Case studies (people who came in sick) were very helpfulTechnical Remarks:Recommend: headphones (good quality)
Wireless access",5
15,Will use in classroom this fall!  It is great!Technical Remarks:Would be nice if there was a back button that would allow you to correct a wrong click and it not take you all way back to start of game,5
15,"I had so much fun with this game, and I am not even related to the discipline of Public Health (I also did quite well!!!) I am amazed by how engaging it was (I could not leave my desk!) and impressed with how much control I had sometimes (i.e. game did not easily lead me through a certain path). Highly recommended for introductory courses, e.g. ""scientific thinking"" or general science",5
16,This is a fantastic resource for encouraging group participation! The ease of use makes it non-intimidating for beginners. The site is streamless and very well done.,5
16,The presentation held the viewers interest. Quick and to the point. Technical Remarks:Loved the animation in th presentation. Very good use of technique and explanation of things going on.,5
16,"you need to learn what Voice Thread is all about.Their main focus is to bring people a cutting-edge experience with digital technology and media. Voice Thread can be used in education, business, or for everyday use at home. On their website you will find very detailed descriptions of how to create and edit voicethreads, how to troubleshoot problems, accessability, privacy & security, account types, purchasing, and more. As I navigated my way through the website and created my own account I felt confident due to the fact that they have easy to follow language and instructions along with videos that walk you through the various ways to create your own Voicethreads.They also provide the users with various manuals, brochures, websites, and publications to walk you through the process of getting started with Voice Thread and how to work on or share any project you complete.People of all ages can use Voicethread, and it has multiple communication modes which is great for use in a special education classroom like mine. You can type comments into your Voicethread, or you can use a microphone to add audio text if you like. Giving people multiple methods of communication is one of the biggest reasons I chose to use it in my classroom. My students are successful using Voice Thread, and it has been an engaging and motivating way to help them learn. I use Voice Thread to enhance my lessons by either creating videos or slideshows that relate to a topic we are learning about, or I create discussion boards where my students can communicate and discuss a lesson or unit we have done.Voice Thread is such a versatile tool, and I would recommend it to any educator I knew who was looking to enhance their lessons and offer students multiple ways of communication and learning. Voice Thread is free to sign up and share, which is another reason why it is great to use in the classroom.As an educator and an educational technology student I would highly recommend looking into Voice Thread and finding out more information.Through my Graduate Degree Program for Educational Technology, I have learned about many new online tools to use in the classroom; Voice Thread being one of them.Voice Thread's easy to navigate website is appealing to the eye with multiple visual images and clearly deatiled links that provide you with the information Technical Remarks:This website and product are easy to use, free, and provide multiple uses for educators and students.",4
16,"VoiceThread is an excellent tool for student reflections. Students can choose to create a video, audio, or text-based comment to address an instructor's prompt.  It has been my experience that most students will try the audio but prefer text, maybe because they do not like the sound of their voice. Some professors use it instead of asynchronous discussion forums, but I don't think this is a good use as it is difficult to respond to another student's post because the comments aren't organized by threads.Technical Remarks:Works on Macs, PCs and iOS devices. Microphones and webcams are recommended but not required.",5
16,"Simply fantastic, the material is useful and really captures the power of voice thread.You can use it on any field. I see potential in training health workersTechnical Remarks:Basic ICT skills",5
16,This is an excellent tool for allowing comments from students on a photograph or other art object.  It would provide an excellent start to a class discussion in either an online or face-to-face environment.,4
17,Actually im using Webquest because this form my students can to learn better and more fast. I recommend it.,4
17,"I think this a good resource that provides an introduction to creating a WebQuest.  I've found that some individuals will design a ""WebQuest"" when what they have really put together is just a ""Web Search"".",4
17,"I use this site in one of my courses in which students actually write and then present a WebQuest.  The model has been around for quitre a while, but the new technology tools, ever-changing online resources, and the opportunity to include the 'creativity' level of the 21st century Bloom's Taxonomy makes this old topic new again.
Concern: Occasionally the matrix returns items that are only tangentially related to the search terms.",5
17,"Bernie Dodge first introduced us to WebQuests in 1995 and they are still a relevant technology integration strategy today. Teachers in one-to-one environments can assign inquiry-based activities that can be completed in a timely manner. The five sections of a WebQuest (Introduction, Task, Process, Evaluation, and Conclusion) are easy to understand and can promote higher level thinking. Teachers can search http://webquest.org for more information on WebQuests.Technical Remarks:WebQuests require Internet access and a current browser such as Firefox or Google Chrome.",5
17,"WebQuests are a great way to enhance student learning, especially since students are  so technologically savvy.Technical Remarks:The links are absolutely wonderful and colorful. The materials are so easy to use, especially for novices.",5
17,This is a good site for learners and teachers who would like to utilize the Web as a tool for teaching and learning. The information about the WebQuest is easy to understand and follow.Technical Remarks:Some of the links were broken,4
17,A very creative way to engage your students.  Great ideas to share.Technical Remarks:Easy to understand instructions for the beginner making a webquest.,5
17,Good material to guide learner on inquiry based learning. Found to be useful with my teacher traineesTechnical Remarks:basic ICT skills assumed,5
17,"The Web Quest is a wonderful tool for engaging students in any subject. I have used it in science and in history courses in the past. Currently, I am investigating it's use for enlivening students' career development. It works most effectively when students create the web quests for others. The challenge is how to bring this traditional web method into Web 2.0 tools! Of course, students will have the answers here too.",5
17,Terrific resource to showcase model WebQuests and offer support to teachers who are creating their own.,4
17,Examples and templates make it very easy for pre-service and in-service teachers to generate their own model for classroom use.Technical Remarks:Built in tutorials make it easy to create own. Teachers should be aware that if using a template with nav bars that they should practice how to make changes to that section so they will know how to instruct their students how to make those particular changes if so desired.,5
17,"I use webquest.org to teach webquest design. To use this site you have to spend some time browsing because webquest.org is webquest ""warehouse""Technical Remarks:The link provided in the description is a redirect to webquest.org",2
17,"I have used webquests in the past, and value the opportunity this one will provide future students I may have.",4
17,Good ideas and relevant content.  Updates seem to be regularly done.,5
17,"I did not spend much time browsing this material, but it caught my eye because in one of my classes that I am taking this semester, I used a webquest and I thought that it was a very interesting way to teach students how to browse the internet.  I thought that the information that it supplied was accurate and that it was very educationally significant.  I think that webquests should be used in all grades.  It helps students with the ability to think about where else they could go to  find information, while giving them guidelines so that unwanted websites don't show up.  If this was used correctly it would enhance teaching and learning in the classroom greatly.  I thought that the way this website was set up was very good.  It has direct links that took you to where they said they would, rather than getting lost and having to back track like some websites.  ",4
17,"The Webquest site was very interesting and valuable tool for new educators. I am just now advancing my degree to enable me to more fully participate in an ADN program at my community college. This site will help me understand better the tools available to me.Technical Remarks:It is very easy to navigate, well marked so I knew what was available without having to use ""trial and error"" to find out what the area was offering.",4
17,"This website could actually be very useful for students that are trying to learn about WebQuest.  It is of good quality, and it has a good setup.  It has a lot of useful information that would be great for aiding in learning.  One down fall to this website would be that they get most of their information from the internet, and most of the information on the internet could be false statements because anyone can post anything on the internet.  But overall this website could be very helpful.",5
17,"I used this site ask an instructional tool to teach my graduate students, who were pre-service teachers, about WebQuests.  The students were instructed to evaluate the site and the Webquests for their educational value in a K-12 setting. Technical Remarks: The site is well organized and easy to navigate. ",5
17,"I spent about 30 minutes trying out various links on this site. The content was of high quality. The trouble I found was that many of the webquest links were not working for some reason. Teachers could use these sites in their classrooms tomorrow! They are well organized, engaging for students, and knowledgably structured to promote learning. I generally found the ones prepared by teachers better constructed than those prepared by college students. This is reasonable considering the teachers would have more experience working with children and, therefore, would be better equipt with an understanding of how children learn. Expectations were better represented.Technical Remarks: First-time users would find this easy to use as the content is geared toward elementary children.",4
17,Very playful way to ecercise the subjunctivo,4
17,I have used Bernie Dodge's site before and I find it very helpful when setting up a WebQuest.  The content is very good and the site is easy to use.  I recommend this site to anyone setting up a WebQuest.,5
18,Fantastic!!!  I am excited to use the 1970 Draft / Lottery example in the PDF version of the text.  ,5
18,"The information is clear and simply stated. The site is well organized I didn't feel overloaded with info like on the Fibonacci number site. I think the simulation app could be very useful to teachers, and plus the cases presented could be used to enhance class material and are very interesting. Hw. has practice reviews, and visual demonstrations for in class learning enhancement.",5
18,We use this material in our intro stats course and it works great.  More specifically we use the confidence interval and the sampling distribution simulations.,5
18,"So i was reading over some of these cases and they seem to work. the ones i read had to do with common sense. i am huge on common sense and if people dont have it, it usually annoys me. so when i was reading these cases and saw that it can be used like this in math, it made me smile(like my case i read) and glad to know im not the only one. i would definatley use this in the classroom because it shows students that there is much more to math then just complicated numbers and formulas.",4
18,"The Java Applets in the Simulations/Demonstrations area are good.
Some students may require background information on using the simulation. Relevancy is not always clear to a novice.",4
18,"As a middle-aged beginning doctoral student, I was 30 years away from my last Stats course. I sometimes have problems visualizing concepts. This site explains many key concepts and provides excellent visuals. Clear & concise.",5
19,This would be a great way for students to review material. ,4
19,I found this site informative and easy to understand for students who have difficulty understanding the basics of the cell structure. I also refer students to this site who would like to refresh their memory on cell structure. Students love it!!,5
19,This is a super site to learn about cells and cell processes.,5
19,I spent about 20 minutes browsing the site including the quiz on cell structure. The content is very useful for my microbiology course I will teach for respiratory care students.It was easy to use.,5
20,"Page layout incredibly small, flash window even smaller, text in flash window smaller still. Amounts to glorified textbook with occasional annoying sound effects. Pictures too small to be worthwhile, text hard and inconvenient to read because of size problems on page. No use of actual animation, doesn't include anything you couldn't get better elsewhere.",1
20,Can be used as assignments outside of class or animations can be used as part of class. Excellent set of animations and materials.,5
20,"A very good introduction into evoultion, it includes all the topics new biology students need to learn, or are considered about. The site is very interactive, and it would be a very good resource for students.",5
20,"Excellent graphics, easy to use and the pictures and text were fabulous.",5
20,"The PBS evolution web site is truly exceptional.  The content covers an impressive breadth and depth of evolutionary theory.  Furthermore, the design of the site is logical and easy to follow.  If used in conjunction with the video series, students could develop a true understanding of evolutionary concepts.Technical Remarks: The plug-ins add an extra level of interest by making the web site more interactive.  Each section of the web page has an adequate level of variety in format to maintain interest regardless of learning preference.",5
21,"This drill and practice material is well laid out. The table of contents makes it very easy to navigate the page. The content is accurate, appropriate and relevant to patient care. There is also relevance to curriculum content in nursing education since each nurse must be aware on cardiac conditions, be able to read EKG strips and provide nursing evaluation and management for patients with cardiac conditions. Recognizing various EKGs is a difficult topic which requires practice therefore, I was quite pleased to note that the page also provides another link to course material where student nurses can acquired knowledge on the topic while, registered nurses can take the course to acquire continuing nursing education credits towards the renewal of their licenses. Due to the multiple scenarios provided the user will be able to cover a wide range of information on cardiac care.  I will definitely use these scenarios and quiz in the future for my cardiac simulation sessions.",5
22,". How you reviewed the materials (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing, 2 hours trying it, or actually use it in teaching-learning activities?). I spent abbout 35 mins. reviewing the material on this site.2. The quality of content (Does the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) I found information to informative and fun.  The little applet above that said did you know...? I foiund it to be interesting.  3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning (If used appropriately, will students' learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?) I belive that for the most part people are visual/interactive before they are analytical. It allows for a better understanding of concepts.  Teachers will find that the comprhending the principles if they something tangable that they can apply it too.4. The ease of using the materials (Will first time users find it easy to use the software?) I think that first time users will find it easy to navigate in this website",4
22,I find this great and plan on using some of the material in my course.,5
22,"This collection of material was very good. There were many interactive games that engage the memory, attention, and problem solving skills of learners. I inspected about 3 puzzles and one significant factor is that there was always an explanation that related to a real-world example. There were also many applications of various levels of math.",5
22,"I spent 5 minutes browsing the website, and decided to play the Fish Soup game. The game was fun, and I assumed it had to deal with statistics, but there was no explanation on how the game was linked to mathematics. As a first time user, it was pretty easy to play, but seeing the direct connection to math and the explanation of what math the game was using was difficult.",3
22,"I spent fifteen to twenty minutes reviewing the games on the site.  I found the site easy to use and a great way to understand concepts in another method of presenting the material (game).

Im not a games person, so I would not go to the site for ""fun"".  As a classroom tool, it may provide an alternative method of expressing more difficult concepts and ideas and a more user-friendly fashion.Technical Remarks:The site was easy to use, understand, and not difficult to navigate. A quick browse enables the student to see what is available very quickly.",4
22,"I took about ten minutes on this website and I loved it!  I loved playing all the games, especially the easy arthimetic ones.  The quality of the content was extremely informative and it was easy to use, and I believe for it to be very effective.  As a student I feel like I learn best through games like this, it helps me to visually and mentally understand the concept!Technical Remarks:I love all the information introduced through a visual, interactive way",5
22,"This site is a definite keeper. I spent about 10 minutes browsing. I liked the fun, engaging attitude of the problems, ranging from the most basic math to the higher level, here's-where-your-brain-gets-fuzzy math. material is given in an informative and clear manner for both teachers and students to use when they need it.  It's simple, user friendly,arranged in clear organized categories, and makes math almost edible. Yes, edible. Students will benefit greatly from this site if they say, need a brush up on a concept or something.",5
22,"cut the knot has a lot of different mathematical subjects to choose from.Theres a verity of topics that can be used for high school and college students. The materials contain movies that you can look at if your more of a visual learner.The text in the material is interactive, making it hands on for the student.The site contains math games and puzzles making it more fun to learn.

22,This site will be good for teachers and parents. it seems to be a good resourse for all your math doing.,4
22,"So i was playing with a few puzzles and they are so confusing. To me i do not get some computer games or puzzles so this one was confusing a little bit. if i was showed how exactly to do this i think i could master it, but since i had to fend for myself i got lost. It is good for people that arnt like me, because im a visual learner and hands on.",3
22,"I spent about 30 min playing in the puzzle, The most important thing about this site that I have found a solution for the 3 Utilities Puzzle that my teacher gave in class.",4
22,I like it...I think. I need to figure out what to do with the site now...,3
22,"I spent about 40 minutes browsing and looking at all the interesting sites. I spent some time trying out some of the games. I ran into many interesting quotes and some of the games were actually really fun. The site is very user friendly and only several of the links did not work properly. The games are very educational. The games I looked at covered materials such as probability, algebra, geometry, arithmetics and more. Its a very useful and informative site. Its great that it has so many games and interactive activities to choose form. All of the material presented on this site is educationally significant.

22,I spent about 30 min. playing the games on this site. They were enjoyable even though i had hard time to figure out the solution. The material accurately present concepts and model that is educationally significant. I think the material can helpful for anyone who is searching but its little hard to understand and also little challenging.,5
22,"I spent about 40-55 minutes reviewing this site. I found very interesting and educational information for example ""veen diagrams are used widely to bolster thought process in every walk of life, whenever decisions have to be made.

It also has what will be used for the thing that is wanted to be looked at. (ex. Three Roads, Three Travelers [Java]) ",4
22,"This is a very user-friendly site full of interesting quotes, interactive games and information. I spent about 30 minutes on the site and tested various links, including the interactive games which I found very interesting and educational... I have no specific favorites but recommend others give it a try, even if just to keep the mind stimulated. The site also sprinkles a lot of interesting quotes throughout the different pages and all the mathematical statements and theorems I came across were very easy to understand. This is a site I'm sure instructors/professors and students alike can enjoy and use as a tool.",5
22,Some of the comparisons that were made (between the math concepts and examples) were rather poor and quite confusing.  As far as content- the basic information was all there and could be rather helpful in reviewing the topic of transitivity.  Technical Remarks: The pop up images which one could manipulate made the site fun to understand,3
22,"I spent about 30 minutes browsing and working on the activities and by the time I logged off I was absolutely lost. There was a series of interactive mathematics miscellany and puzzles. I tired to word out a couple of the puzzles, but they were too confusing for me. This site a site also provides several of information about different puzzles, for example about geometry, probability and other mathematical material. I think this site had a bit to much information, as I was browsing and trying out the activities I felt overwhelm. I think the material can be helpful if uses for research, with the expectation that the material is hard to understand. This material appears to be challenging to master.",4
22,"I spent about 15 minutes looking over the material for cut the knot. I saw a lot of mathematical games that I thought were interesting and they sort of helped me to understand what I was doing a little better. The content seemed a little unorganized and I sort of got a little lost when I first started to look at things, but I finally found my way around and it all worked out fine.This could definatly be a good teaching tool, especially for those people who learn with hands on types of things. I liked the use of ganms to help explain mathematical techniqes. It really help me out.Some of the materials were kind of tricky and it took me a little bit to figure them out. I just had to read the directions carfully and make sure that I was doing evrything right. All in all this website was very interesting.",4
22,"I thought that this site was quite interesting. I enjoyed going through serveral of the games. They were enjoyable even though i was unable ever beat the computer or figure out the solution. I tried the 3 glass game, the night game, the 7 coins, the date game and the bogus nim game. All of which i lost but i found very thought prevoking. I feel that these games could be brought in to a school envirernment and be found to be very beneficial to a classroom were students would be forced to really utilize their minds and try to solve these problems. I found that this site was very user friendly and made it quite easy to navigate.",4
22,"I spent about 25 min. reviewing the site.  By reading the manifesto I got a feel for the flavor of the site - that is, the site covers a lot of mathematical material that you may have wondered about and gives quite a few ideas and answers that the average person would never think about.  I liked the 'Did you know that...' section because it offers a recreational view of math that is beneficial to the 'math phobic'  The site is well set up and easy to navigate.  I would use the site in the future.   ",5
22,i probably spent about 20 minutes on this software. I played a few of the games. The games had an explanation link to them if you needed help. The information in the material gave good explanations.,4
22,"I spent about 15-20 minutes looking over the site.  The explains well about a person who doesn't like math for a particular reason.  This site can help people who hate math for one reason or another.  Its a more hands on expirence.  Better than just reading something in a book.  When it is put in an interactive format you can work with your hands.  If something is wrong it will tell you.  Not make fun of you, not critisize you, or anything of that sort.  Very good article.",4
22,"I spent a good bit of time on this site, of course p[laying the games.  They were an interesting way to present math theories, but I think a less complex explaination of the solution is needed.  And I am not sure exactly what the Memory Game has to do with math, as there was no explaination.  All together, a very good site, with many tools, many explainations of math theories.",4
22,"I did not speed a ton of time reviewing this cite, but in the time I spent the cite seem like an endless source of mathematical information. It had everything from an extensive glossary to a interactive activites to proofs. This could be a good tool for teacher to put to use. ",4
22,I am not a math person and this was really fun.  It was nice doing math in an interactive game mode.  You don't want to drift off on this math.  I really paid attention.  Some problems were challenging and some were extremely hard.  Overall the hour I spent didn't seem like a math class.,5
22,"Wow!!!! That was the best web page. I think ""Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles"" is very usefull and user friendly. You can spend many hours and not be bored of math. Yes that is a true statement. I thought that the page is very useful in trying to solve math useing interactive games. I play video games that can rot my brain, but if I spent not play video games and started ""Cut-the-Knot"" web page I would learn more about solving problems. I thought this page had all sorts of math easy and very hard games. The cool thing is that if you can't solve you can reset and try it again. Also it show tip and example of problems.Technical Remarks: Very user friendly......WOW!!!!!!!!!",5
23,"This site gives the material type, technical format,location, author and submitter. The material was excellent. There are innumerable concepts for our information. The site is very useful and interesting for new learners like me. Being an art student, I was very impressed by the details of Fibonacci's rabbits, Dudedeney's cows and honey bees and family trees. I was excited to see Fibonacci numbers in so many fruits and vegetables. It was very informative. Dr Knott's Fibonacci and Phi was very impressive. The latest being the Pen rose tilings has exhibited five-fold symmetry yet which do not repeat themselves.Technical Remarks:It was quite easy to browse this site. I was able to browse according to my Professor's instructions. And here I am with a little effort.",5
23,"If you are someone who enjoys numbers or working with patterns then you will like this site.  This site deals with other kinds of Math. For instance,many puzzles in dealing with nature and animals to try like the honeybees where numbers add together to make a certain group. The number Trick is a must to try under Mathematical Magic Fibonacci Numbers. It gives a very good explanation and a formula on how to do it. So you pick any two numbers add plus the new number ten times and try it with your friends. Also, working with triangles in making a number pattern inside the triangle. And,you can try doing a family tree. Also,numbers dealing with prime numbers and factors I found that this part was difficult to understand the pattern of numbers. However, there was a table of numbers was easier to see the process.As well as towards the end of each puzzle it gives an option if you like for Things To Do so you can try it yourself. And, they are also great pictures included for each puzzle. So, if you like doing puzzles and nature then you would enjoy this site. Also,any of you teachers out there it is great tool because they can work with their students in groups dealing with patterns and numbers. I enjoyed viewing this site for about an hour in solving these puzzles.   Technical Remarks: While I was on this site there wasn't any problems while I was looking over this site. While I was trying the problems it was easy to get to the next page and move back to the begining. There was no conflict like the site dissapeared or I couldn't get the page up on screen.",3
23,The content on the site is very helpful and entertaining. The site describes Fibonacci's numbers simply with a variety of useful visual aids.Some of the examples used to describe how Fibonacci's sequence works is a little bit confusing but most of them get the point across well. The examples used to describe the golden number was also fascinating. I found that using the examples was not difficult and the questions did not require too much critical thinking. It was an easy to learn system.,4
23,"I found this content educational and interesting
I had read about this in my math book but this helped me understand better because of the visual aid.The material was easy to understand,pleasurable to use. Great for the first time user.I thought it presented the content accurately.It made the concept easy to grasp because of the way information was related to every day items.",5
23,"I spent about 7 mintues looking over the page, and basically I was looking over for titles that striked my interest.  I think the one that I liked alot was about Fibonacci and who he was.  I think its great when learning math to understand the history too, that way you can pick up interests to students who love history and can relate math through it.  I think the quality of the content is great, its extremely informative, and looks like it is updated consistently.  I think it could enhance teaching because of all the information it contains...but, I personally wish there was better visuals ( like maybe pictures of rabbits to replace/represent numbers) that were interesting besides the use of numbers as the visual aid. That would probably keep me more engaged when viewing this site.  It was really easy to view this website, especially when it provided a Content Box at the top of the website so I can see a preview of the remaining website and it categories without have to look through the whole thing.  Overall I think its great!Technical Remarks:Better Visuals",4
23,"The website is pretty useful, I spent about 10 minutes trying to navigate to this page, a few times it didnt load right away (might be my computer) As for the content, I enjoyed it. I like Fibonacci numbers and think that material that is at our disposal like this should be used and brought to attention more.",4
23,"This Web site is full of information.  I spent about an hour browsing the links and looking at it from a teaching perspective as well as a practical perspective.  I found that there was a mathematical explanation for a graceful spiral.  Who knew!  Yes, I'm new to Fibonacci and mathematical theories, but what I found in the art and architecture links opened up a new world to me.  As a newbee, the puzzles were a bit over my head, as were some of the explanations.  But, new to Fibonacci as I am, the concept clicked when I could link a string of numbers to an aesthetic in art.  I recommend checking out Brian Knott's ray tracing in the art section... and in the architecture section, the Cal Poly Engineering Plaza is stunning.  

Unfortunately I found many broken or outdated links which was a bit frustrating.  However, I still recommend this site for the novice or advanced mathematician as well as those who teach art or math.  This is a very complete Web site.Technical Remarks:Many broken or outdated links.",4
23,"this is very detailed and interesting... it helped me understand fibonaccia numbers a lot more

-dean levita",5
23,really good links i reviewed alot of fibonocci numbers and phi good refresher,4

23,I spent about 45 min on this site! I loove the math involved in fibonacci! (Mostly because it has to do with nature) I think this site does an awesome job explaining everything involved with fibonacci. It's easy to understand and definately will be of help when I need to do further research on this subject! :),5
23,"This section is great for people who have studied Fibonacci numbers in the past, or even if it is their first time. It explains first what they are and what they require, secondly, places you can find them (i.e. nature) and also talks about the golden section. It gives you realistic applications of the Fibonacci numbers which usually helps people when dealing with math. A practical application is always helpful. It also gives art references which would help someone connect to the lesson. The quality of the page and information is decent, accurate and easy to follow.Technical Remarks:It it organized very well and easily understood from start to finish.",3
23,"I spent about Ten minutes reviewing the material. It was interesting to me because I have seen the Fibonacci numbers and golden section in class before. It was interesting to see a different outlook on the material. The material was put together very well and was very organized. It was easy to understand and read. It presented the material accurately and showed great detail. I feel that if a student needed to access material about Fibonacci numbers and the golden section, this material presented would be a good source of information. It would be good because it is easy to understand, but all has all the information needed to know everything you would want to know about this topic. I this material would be easy to use for first times user. I am a first time user and was glad to find a description of material I had seen before, in a different way. It is good to have a different perspective on material that you have seen before. If I wanted to know more about this topic I would use this website.",5
23,The website is defiantly packed with information. I've done research on Fibonacci numbers before and this website would have been helpful and more trustworthy then some of the other sites I visited. The information is very thorough and would make an excellent resource to teaching.,4
23,"I browsed around the site, clicked on links, and surveyed it from the perspective of both a math student and a content judge; read through various portions of the site and subsequent links. Content of the site is excellent, filled with extensive information on the Fibonacci numbers and its related topics; plenty of information along with numerous references and external sites to explore. There is information on who Fibonacci is (personal information, biography) along with what the Sequence is, how it is used, and its history. Very relevant to learning math/Fibonacci sequence and would most definitely be useful for anyone researching this topic, as the information is extensive and well-researched, along with being very well-represented.

I have studdied about Fibonacci's number and this website does a great job on covering the material. They cover the material in every aspect. It gives great examples, what is it, where it's found, where did it come from.",5
23,"When I first clicked on this link, i expected the site to list a bunch of facts on Fibonacci numbers and the golden section. But as i explored the sight further, i found the material to be very helpful and interesting. take for example how the site explained, fibonacci and the original problem about rabbits where the series first came up. I thought that this site would be helpful for someone who wants to learn about Fibonacci numbers and get an overview of some problems. It was pretty self explanitory on how to veiw and use the sight.",4
23,"Thank you for that. It took me a while to digest what I was reading, but I appreciate the details that went into creating this. 
It took about twenty minutes for me to just browse lightly over the website. All in all, I thought that it was very impressive and easy to navigate around.
The content was great!The fact that it was broken down into sections with links below made it a lot easier. I have read lightly on Fibonacci's Numbers and I wish that someone had told me about your work earlier, because the explanation is very detailed and organized--the topic was very well covered. I would definitely visit this site again next time I have to write a paper.
The site is great for students who are looking for more information on Fibonacci Numbers, and it's also good to read for fun and curiosity.",4
23,"I think that this topic, the Fibonacci sequence in particular, is very interesting. I enjoy the materials that were used to further explain and illustrate the concept of the Fibonacci numbers. The visual aides that were used were very effective, in fact the material relating to the Fibonacci square I found personally to be quite interesting. I had not heard about the Fibonacci square and with the examples that are used in this material, it makes it very clear and strikes in me a new found intrigue.",5
23,the site is really interesting and very exciting. its is very enjoyable somewhat is was kind of hard. if you dont know what Fibonacci means set counts 1 and 2 equals 3. 3 and 2 equal 5. etc,5
23,"i spend a while looking over this website. the website is very detailed. however, it semms like a lot all at once. a little crowded and confusing.",3
23,I spent 15 minutes exploring this website. I feel this site has a lot of great material and number patterns tat are interesting and fun. This definently can help students by not only teaching them but giving examples and material to look at. This site is fairly easy to navigate I got mixed up a little.,5
23,"I browsed through all the links and used the applets. This site is very helpful, it has a broad list of explanations, pictures, and visualizations to help the learner. It is well organized and had lists of references and further things to do that could be helpful for continued learning.",5
23,"Hi, my name is Andy, i am a student at Mission College. There is a lot of great stuff on this website, i have spent all most 1 hour and 300 minutes on this website because it is so interesting. This site is very useful because everything is there, we don't need to spend 3 hours looking for the materials.

For the most part the site is clear and helpful for anyone looking to learn about Fibonacci and the golden selection. The materials are simply written without too many distracting fonts, colors and pictures.",4
23,"I spent 30 minutes reviewing material related to the Fibonacci website. I spent about half the time looking at the different number patterns and sequences. The other half of my time was spent exploring the many links. In addition, I learned about the Golden String also by Fibonacci which reminded me of modern computer binary code. The website presents many useful teaching instruments, this is done mainly by visually showing the way in which the numbers are sequenced. I would say the website was great and would help people that were interested in learning more about Fibonacci Numbers.",5
23,"The Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section was an amazing learning material. I spent a few days exploring this information to better further my knowlege about the Fibonacci sequence. I was really happy to find this information because it helped me to write my midterm paper. The material presented showed many concepts that pertain to math. Not only did the inforamtion pertain to math the Fibonacci sequence has connections with nature, sexual reproduction, and the human body. Students will learn a whole new persepctive on concepts that i mentioned above. learning about the fibonacci sequence gave me the opportunity to enhance other students in my class about nature and the golden spiral and how they followed the fibonacci sequence exactly. If you are a first time user using this website you should have no problem trying to access information to help futher better their knowlege on topics of interest.",5
23,I would like to say thank you to all who have taken the time in creating this web page.  I really benefit a lot from the learning material.  I have gotten some great ideas for extra math problems for my kids to work on over the summer.,4
23,"After reading this great resource, I learned a lot of new interesting information to me from this site.  I have never heard about Fibonacci numbers and the Golden section. I spent more than one hour reading and looking over all the material on this web site. I liked the graphics and images on the web site, because they were engaging. The Fibonacci Rabbit Sequence was one of the most fascinating concepts.  I also found the plant example to be interesting, because as it appears that the amount of petals on plants is a Fibonacci number. The information was very informative and descriptive. I had to read a lot to understand the concept but the material was very clear and precise.  It is very useful and helpful information. Teachers can use this as an aid to teach this concept. The site is very effective and will enhance a students knowledge. This site provides a lot of useful information which can be linked to many math courses and a persons life.Technical Remarks:I am a first time user of this web site and I found it very easy to follow. I found a lot of helpful, clearly described content. There are many areas which contain visuals which makes it even more interesting. This site was developed in a very good way. The layout is perfect and the content is easy to understand if you read it carefully.",5
23,"I spent almost 45 minutes to familiarize my self with this webpage. I found it really useful because it is an excellent resourse to aid teachers in teaching this subject and also it enhances learning capabilities. I think the material provided is very useful for Math students to help understand them the course better. I found that this website was very well organized and very easy to read.

The potential effectiveness for enhancing  for both students and teachers is very high. I think the website is very easy to use and understand.",5
23,"This is a great example of a well organized informative site. Be prepared to spend a few hours to really get into the material provided. The examples, reasonings, even the formulas are well organized. The Visual aids involved is very attractive, and keeps ones attention. Its easy to read and we can easy find the value in the information provided. Again I cant stress the amount of material available, and for those who are new to this material, dont stress. The way its laid out, its presents itself to the highly experience to the inexperience.",4
23,"I spent one hour going through all the different links at this site. Before I went to this site I had no idea what a Fibonacci number and the Golden Section was. But now after this I have learn a lot. The quality of the material was great and well organized. It was easy to read and learn. I liked the example of plants. On many plants, the number of petals is a Fibonacci number. For example, Daisies can be found with 34, 55 or even 89 petals. Also, Pine cones show the Fibonacci spirals clearly.Technical Remarks:This site contains a variety of images and graphics. I found this site to be really easy to go through and very easy to understand.",4
23,"I spent about two hours and so, I found this website to be really easy to go through and very easy to understand. This section and its visual content made it interesting and easy to understand. The examples and found them fun as well as useful in math. It helped me to grasp a better understanding of the concepts,and the quality of the material is great and written very deeply.

This is an excellent resource to aid teacher's in teaching this subject and it does enhance learning capablities.Technical Remarks: I think the material provided was great and well organized. It was easy to read and learn. With Merlot and a regular search engine the Fibonacci site was easy to access for me and I'm sure it would be for first time users as well. ,4
23,"After reading through this great information, it took me about ten to fifteen minutes looking over and reading it.  I thought that all of the information was very useful and very descriptive as well.  I tried taking down some important notes and began writing down some of the bold letter words.     As I was reading all of the material that was given to me I realized that most of the information helped me to understand what a real Fibonacci number was and what it represents.  All of the concepts that were brought up in this site were very descriptive and very educational as well.  I thought that all of the information was educationally significant because it gave certain models and explinations of what a student was trying to look at or find.     I think that the students learning will be enhanced if they choose to look at this site because of the simple fact that it gives a great meaning to what students are trying to find.  This site also gives great understanding to all the material as well.  Once a student takes a look at what they are trying to study, they will find that these sites will be very helpful to them no matter what.     I also believe that first time users will find this technique very easy to use and go by because it gives so many different examples and notes to understand the material.",4
23,"It was really intresting to come across this topic, as I just recently finished reading The Davinci Code, by Dan Brown and the Fibonacci Numbers were used as a cypher in two different situations.  This topic is quite fascinating and I really like how this website depicted feasible ideas of this concept.  The Golden Number was also discussed, which I found equally as intriguing.  Again it was great to see that almost everything in nature correlates with the golden number.  I spent about 30 minutes browsing this topic and think it has given me a great topic for my final research paper!Technical Remarks: The content on this page is quite helpful.  Everything is explicitly described and clearly depicted so it is very easy to follow along.  I think everyone should easily be able to grasp this concept as described on this web page.  It was very effective.",4
23,"I learned a lot from the sit, and before I went to this sit I had no idea what a Fibonacci number was, and had no idea how the golden setion worked. This sit I feel was very educational, and I also have to say it was very easy to follow.  So I enjoyed this sit a lot.Technical Remarks: Try to not be so confusing on the golden section.  I understand it might be very hard not to be confusing, but maybe there can be a more fun approuch to the material.",4
23,"I spent aproximately two hours fumbling through the site. this is no fault of the site, but the inexperience of the user. i did spend some time on the fibonacci numbers, specificaly the the rabbits and reproduction. this section and its visual content made it interesting and easy to understand. i feel the general effectiveness is good and that the  overall learning potential for both students and teachers is high.  Technical Remarks: the content quality is good at least from the areas i attended. i especially liked the areas i viewed because the were visual and easy to understand. if fiist time users are proficient on the computer and the internet ",4
23,"I found this website to be really easy to go through and very easy to understand. I went through it for about 15 mins and looked at some of the puzzles and listened to an audio play on the golden section.     The material seemed to be pretty accurate on the goldon section, at least from what I have learned in my math class. It helped me to grasp a better understanding of the concepts.     This site seemed like a pretty legitimate site for use as a teaching tool. I think it could be a good tool.    The materials were very user friendly.",4
23,"I spent a while going through this site and looking at all the different links. Before I read this page I never even heard of a Fibonacci number or sequence. But now after this I have an extremely good awareness of what they are now. I liked the examples that they used on this page, how many bunny rabits can be produced in a given time and the whole bumble bee thing. I never knew that rabbits can reproduce after a month. Then the examples with the bee's the male's compared to the female's were very cool. I tried the Fibonacci sequence for myself by doing the diagram and following all the directions it says. This material accurately presents concepts and models that are very good for educational purposes. They break it down and explain it with out confusing you. The models are good and also are not confusing. After reading this I now know what the Fibonacci numbers are and how the Fibonacci Sequence appears in nature. ",4
23,"I spent a fair amount of time reviewing the material and trying to grasp the concept.  I tried to follow along, rereading certain sections, but had very little luck understanding.Technical Remarks: I think that the page was laid out well and I found it appropriate to have as many pictures and examples as it did.  Even though I couldn't understand it I still gave it a four: I think that the material was well organized and I'm sure would make perfect sense to a more mathematically inclined individual.  The pages go into great detail about the subject and present the material in a number of different ways.  I found the section on the Golden Section in Nature to be interesting and some of that made sense but apparently, Fibonacci numbers are not for me.  I am sure that the material was presented accurately and that this is educationally significant.  The author gave examples and backed them up with proofs and pictures/diagrams.  I don't know if this would be the best ""candidate"" for enhancing learning and teaching, but that is strictly based off of my own experience with the material and this is not to say that others wouldn't benefit from it.  I suppose it would be fine to use if the words were put a little more simply.  The software was easy to use and the links were easy to access.",4
23,"After spending 10 minutes on how to figure out how to get to the web page, I'd say I spent about 20 minutes really grasping all the information I could take in.  This web site was extremely easy to use and to get around.  I loved everybit of this site.  The thing that struck me most was not necessarily the math, but being a visual person, the pictures showed how it could be used in a different scenario other then numbers and art. The golden section was already fascinating for me, but to see how they provided different images and explanations, this made my experience even better than originally expected.  Overall to get to the site was a bit difficult but after a couple of minutes fooling around, you'd get the hang of it.",4
23,I enjoyed this facinating site...so many links and so little time! I especially liked the animation regarding the circular spiral moving within the daisey-like shape. So much of nature relates to the Fabonacci Numbers and the Golden SectionTechnical Remarks: This site was easy to navigate thru.,5
23,"I thought the site gave a lot of intresting ideas in fibonacci numbers. They gave good examples of concepts to this type of math, making it easy to understand how the math can be used. There was not alot of applications on the site. It had educational purpose on puting projects togeather.    ",4
23,"I love this site!  I am a first time user and yes, it was very easy to use the software.  I'm embarrassed to admit I did not know what Fibonacci numbers are.  I just like the name, Fibonacci.  Once I arrived, the simple explanation of what Finonacci numbers are fascinated me (I guess it's easy to fascinate me).  I immediately thought, ""how cool!""  I went to the link that was mentioned in terms of introducing one to the site and was drawn to the animals.  I could spend hours on this site.  In fact, I may go back.  Who or what is Fibonacci?  I actually figured out the rabbit problem.  The visuals were great and having the answer available is even better.  Thank you.Technical Remarks: Very simple, user friendly.  Well done and so easy to understand.  ",5
23,"I spent a few minutes looking over this site.  I found that it was organized fairly well.  I liked that right away it showed what the Fibonacci secuence, golden section numbers, and the golden ratio all were.  Then I told where to go to get a basic understanding of the ideas.Technical Remarks: I have had a very small amount of experience with these concepts.  I think this site does a good job at showing even someone like me how these concepts might be useful or applied.  ex.  rabbit family trees, or packing to save on wasted space",5
23,"Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section is quite intriguing to me. Not necessarily the history behind Fibonacci but the section on Numbers and Nature. Since I have an appreciation for nature I am more inclined to gather my information here. Mathematics? surrounds me and I haven?t been able to recognize it. Fibonacci has my attention.This site offers plenty of resources ? enough to make your head spin. My second time exploring this site kept me busy for a couple of hours. If you have difficulty understanding math and love nature this is the place to come.Technical Remarks: This site offers students and teachers a like a great variety of topics and helps. There are convent tools such as calculators, charts and graphs that assist in understanding mathematical principals. ",5
23,"Hi, my name is Beatriz Solorio, and I'm a student at Mission college in Santa Clara California.  When visiting the Fibbonacci web site it took me approximately an hour to read.  This was due to the fact that I took time in reading what I thought was interesting.  I gave this site the highest score because I thought that it really was informative and actually fun to learn.  This site focused on a series of numbers called Fibbonacci.  It was interesting to find out were this idea came from, and how these numbers are found in nature. It also introduced the idea of ""phi"" the Greek representation of 1.61804.... The pictures were one of the best parts of this site; they really helped in understanding the concept.  ",5
23,Lovely materials! They can certainly brighten up a math class!,5
23,"Wow!  This site is VERY rich in content and quality.  I spent over one hour here just the first time.  I'm sure I'll be back many times.  It is like math play-land.  The first time I heard of Fibonacci numbers and the golden section was when I saw a Disney producion called ""Donald Duck in Mathamagic land"" or something like that. It was a long time ago.  The program and its treatment of these topics has made a lasting impression on me.  I was very pleased to see those two topics together on one website.  I know I only saw the tip of the iceberg here.  The site and its links seem endless.  I especially enjoyed the Fibonacci puzzle section, although I have only visited the simple games thus far.  I can see why this is an award winning site.Technical Remarks: Everything I visited on this site worked flawlessly.  I am not qualified to rate it technically, except that as a learning tool, it is very effective.  ",5
23,"It took me about couple minutes to get to the siteand more than 2hrs to review the materials on the site. The site is so large. It will take alot of time to cover every single information. I think this web-site is very useful for enhancing teaching and learning. The quality of material content is perfect. We can find most of valued informations we need about Fibonacci Numbers and The Golden section. I love the way they arranged the pages. The informations, formulars, examples, explainations, sources,etc are conected. Web- links and references are powerful. Especially, the website was designed very organization with interested graphics; thus,that makes the users are quite persuaded and actracted. The direction is clear and helpful for users easy to enter the entire pages. The materials are written simple, easy to read and understandable. It is excelent site, and suitable for different levels of background knowledge.",5
23,This site is rich in information on the Fibonacci numbers and their mystery. I've spent 15 minutes following the links and the trail of information. Feasting on examples and charts. The links to outside sites are just as good. I think this site will do well to instruct the expert as well as the intermediate. There is such a wealth of information that you'd be hard pressed to not go away withs some deeper understanding.,5
24,"Always ipd adress was very complicate for me, but i think that with this material, could i to learn right now.",5
24,Reviewed these videos for about one half hour. This is an excellent series of videos that can be used in a classroom to help students understand a difficult subject (subnetting). I will use some of these in a routing and switching class that I teach.,5
24,"Very good information - well organized, easy to follow.Technical Remarks:The audio tool bar could be smaller and more graphics instead of just audio or even video might make it more interesting.  Overall great job.",4
24,Easy to use and has very good information for students to learn and understand IP addressing. ,4
24,I only browsed the material for a few minutes.  The quality of content is very good and is very helpful.  The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching is great it is a very good page with lots of good information.Technical Remarks: I didnt use the materials much at this time but I plan to come back and use this more in the future.,5
24,"This site is easy to use and has very good information for students to use on their own to learn about IP addressing. There is a fee to use it in a classroom, so it is best used outside of the classroom, as an additional study guide for students.Technical Remarks: Since this site contains a ""video"" slide show, it takes a long time to load on a dial-up line. This may make it difficult for students to use because they will get frustrated waiting for each portion to load.",4
24,I spent a few minutes browsing this site.  This site had good quality material on it.  I think this site will enhance learning because it is layed out in an easy to understand outline.  ,5
24,"This was an excellent jumping board for the beginer in networking. I have very little knowledge of binary numbers and I do not grasp math very well, but the tutorial videos were an excellent teaching source.  In past classes the subject material all seemed to be over my head and way too complex for me. This information brought the materials to my level by explaining piece by piece how exactly the numbers worked.  I did not get to spend the time that I would have liked on this tutorial, but the time that I spent was well worth it.  This would have been a very effective teaching tool in some of my earlier Computer Science classes.Technical Remarks: I absolutely loved how this tutorial used PowerPoint, Windows Media and voice stream to bring this to the learners.  Some of the flaws that I found were that the slides were not visable due to the compression at all points during the ""lecture"".  The voice of the presenter was very nice to listen to and kept the learner involved",5
24,"Students may use this tutorial for their own personal use but if you want to implement it within a classroom environment you must purchase a license. Excellent, well developed tutorial...",4
25,Excellent resource for any Mathematics course. I use it often.,5
25,"Wow, Very interesting so much information to review alot of time went into this material. This content was extremly easy to browse.

People could very easily use this in the classroom in several different ways. First time users could find it very easy to use",5
25,"I first browsed through the material for about ten minutes; I then narrowed my search to ancient Babylonian mathematics. Had incredible amounts of information with pictures and graphs. 
Easy to understand and get around the graphs and pictures were significant to the subject matter, I could spend hours on here getting information about the history of math.
This site has so much information: links to encyclopedias, biographies, glossaries, quotations, timelines this is such a great resource for students and teachers to learn.
tool to demonstrate mathematics in a way where its fast and much easier to teach. 
I found this website very user friendly it was organized in such a great way. When I looked up Babylonian mathematics it had lots of subcategories that gave great information and served as a great learning tool.",5
25,A bevy of resources at your disposal.  Very imformative.  I browsed around and found pretty much everything you need for math. I love the time line of mathematics ecspecially. Tell you the famous mathematicians of their times.  Very fun and cool,5
25,"I was quite pleased to find this site, as the history of math was the direction I had planned to take for future assignment in my math G class.  There is a wealth of information that will benefit me greatly; whether it be in the way of a particular person that I focused on, or a certain time period.  I spent about an hour looking at the website, and not only found information on people of math from past time periods, but calulations, pictures, graphs, cartoon strips, and much more. Although the visual quality of the website looks a little amateur, the content is rich in details, yet there is clarity of understating for someone such as myself who is not math savvy.",5
25,"I spent more than one hour reviewing and using the materials on this website.  I used the materials for my classroom activities.  I found The History of Mathematics, and especially, the  biographies in this site to be fascinating.Technical Remarks:The quality of the content of this site accurately presents concepts and models that are educationally significant.

This website is large, and I am sure that I will continue to spend more time reading it. The website is easy to maneuver.",5
25,"At first, I was overwhelmed by the contents of the material, but as soon as I started reading I found it very interesting. The site offers a lot of excellent historical background of various cultures, biographies of mathematicians, well detailed time line, and a lot of references. I will definitely use this site for future reference.Technical Remarks:All links are simple and well organized.Alphabetical and chronological index for easy access.  The site is user friendly too.",5
25,"Outstanding site! Within two clicks I was right where I wanted to be.  Very rich in content on the History of Mathematics, educationally significant for any college student.  Visual learners will appreciate the symbols, maps, equations and photos. Excellent overview of Mathematics in various cultures from the Ancient Babylonians to the Americans and Scotts.  Each overview has links that take you to specific biographies. A History Topics Index simplifies your search. All printer friendly.
Index is clear, specific.Technical Remarks:Very easy to navigate from one link to the next.
Color highlighted links with generous spacing for ease in reading topics. Each topic has numerous links to do further research.  Excellent source for teachers or students. Very well written.",5
25,"I've never seen a website that had so much information in one place about math of all topics. He or she can find out about mathematicians as far back in time as possible. I even click on a site that had every women mathematician and their background. And specific dates that you could click on to find out who was born or died on that day. The math topics itself; he or she could get the definition. I just thought this was an amazing site to view. This site, I would definitely tell people about who needs information on any math topic.Technical Remarks:I had no difficulty reviewing the content in this website. It took me through one amazing site each time I click on something different. I thought where does it stop. But then I thought do I want it to stop? No, I loved it. Being a student this would be a source to go to for information the first time around.",5
25,"This is my first time on this site. I have spent 45 minutes exploring and reviewing different links.  I have found the History of Mathematics as one of the links that has sparked my interest.  The material is  very detailed.  There is a quantity of quality information available for either mathematical research or lea sure educational reading. I enjoyed reading the mathematician for the day which was Lazare Carnot (1753 - 1823).Technical Remarks:The website takes some getting use to. All the links make it difficult to identify in which direction you are traveling in.  After 40 minutes of searching, I have become accustom to the layout.  First time users like myself will find this easy as long as long as they are prepared to give the site patience.  There is a lot of useful and helpful information on this site.",4
25,I spent almost 30 minutes in exploring this site. It is quite an interesting website because there is a lot of information given about the history of mathematicians. The more you explore this site the more information and resources youll get. The quality of content is very clear to understand because it gives a detailed time line or information about a specific period of math history. I found that this site is really very effective for enhancing teaching because it gives you the information and biographies of Mathematicians in various cultures and from different parts of the world. This site is very easy to use and browse material and also it gives you the clear instructions about how to use it and its also as easy to use as any other website there are no complications in using this website and the interesting thing is its free.,5
25,"This site is definitely one of the sites that I bookmark. The historically information regarding math is quiet interesting. There is plenty of information on here that will keep you busy for hours on end. Some unappealing aspects of this site however is the multiple additional sites that must be gone through to actually access the historical information. One item that caught my attention was the time line, Im still not sure why. I guess it might have been that it took me a few glances at it to grasp what was trying to be taught. Overall I rate this site 8/10, its very informative and helpful to any student and or instructor. For anyone with a report on the history of math, THIS IS YOUR SITE!!",4
25,"I found this site very simple to use. I easily browsed through time lines and biography on famous mathematicians and before I knew it I was way over my head in data but interested in math again. After about 20 minutes or so, I moved on but I thought how this would be a great reference website for a student doing a paper or project on a famous mathematician or a famous moment in math  history where a detailed time line or information about a specific period would be helpful. Also, I thought that the website was very user friendly which is really important for general educational usage.",4
25,"this website has alot biographies one alot of people. biographies dont have that much information about the people. the biographies are one page long and some have pic's but not all of them. this website also gives you a lot of informatoin on ""Mathematics in various cultures"" for example:
Ancient Babylonian mathematics
Ancient Egyptian mathematics
Ancient Greek mathematics
Arabic mathematics
Chinese mathematics
Indian mathematics
Mayan mathematics
American mathematics
Mathematics in Scotland
overall its a okay site to see but not so great.",3
25,Wow!!! This is just what I have been looking for. I will be implementing this in my 6th grade classroom soon.,5
25,"I spent about hour+ viewing this site.  I really enjoyed finding history of math which is more than I knew before.  This includs biographies of math, math in carious cultures, time line, in-depth converage of a large number of history topic. Very simple, informative site.  I love math history!!!! I really recomeded a studnet who really want to learn and know about a math history.",4
25,"This is a simple page but contains a lot of information.  At first I don't know what to expect from this website, but the more I read, the more I find out about mathematic.  I spent 45 minutes browsing this website and there are so much information that I learned from.  This is a great resource page for math researching.",4
25,". How you reviewed the materials (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing, 2 hours trying it, or actually use it in teaching-learning activities?). I spent about 25 minutes review material in this section.2. The quality of content (Does the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) The content was informative and it has excellent hisotrical background information on mathematics.  3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning (If used appropriately, will students' learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?) This is an excellent to use if you are doing historical research of Mathematics.  It allows both teacher/student the ability to enhance knowlege, understanding and learning potential.4. The ease of using the materials (Will first time users find it easy to use the software?) Yes this site was quite easy to use and I will possibly use it to write my final paper in Math G.",4
25,"I spent 1 hour viewing Mac Tutor History of Mathematics. I really enjoyed reading the information on this resource it was very interesting and educating. This resource is very helpful, it provides lots of information about the history of math. After veiwing this resource, I want to learn more about the history of math and explore other similar sites. This is a great resource to use for a paper and for first time users.",5
25,"I spent approximately 15 minutes browsing, at which time I focused on the history of Greek math.  My interest in Ancient Greek architect led me to discover that mathematics and architecture were, in many ways, considered one and the same.  I spent a total of 45 min. reviewing the wealth of information provided regarding Ancient Greek mathematics.  There is such a broad range of topics, ranging from biographies to teaching methods, to principals, that I could easily spend much more time reviewing this material.  I found each area to be well written, interesting, and informative.  I may have discovered the next topic for my final mathematics paper.  Thanks!!Technical Remarks: This site was relatively easy to navigate through.  I was surprised at the speed in which I not only received my password, but also in how clear the directions were for getting to each link.",5
25,I really enjoyed this sight.  There were various attachments that included exclusive information.  I liked how it had information on many mathematicians dating from 500 b.c.  It also had mathematics from different cultures which was very interesting,4
25,The MacTutor History of Math site which is from Scottland has the largest amount of general math concepts on any site I have ever seen. It's basically the mathematical equivlent of Google. After viewing certain topics such as the Fibonachi Sequence and Statistics I wouldnt go anywhere else for math related stuff!,5
25,"I'm very impressed with this site.  I entered the site not really knowing what to expect and stayed for awhile.  I'm in the process of writing a paper on Albert Einstein and was amused to find a page of quotations from him.  My favorite (and I'm using it in my paper) is:""Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics, I assure you that mine are greater.""  I will absolutely visit this site again to capture more information regarding my current site as well as look up information regarding other mathematicians I have written about in the past.  The maps are thorough beyond belief and very interesting to see.  The more you explore this site the more you uncover.  There seems to be a gem at each turn.Technical Remarks: Very simple.  My biggest problem was wanting to go everywhere and getting lost in my own thoughts.  A few times, I completely lost my focus because something more interesting caught my eye.",5
25,"It seems to me that this is a very well organized site.  The format is simple, straight forward, with no flashing logos, or any of the other things that annoy me so.  The information is honest, even mentioning that the biographies may have had some dramatic liberties taken with them.  Simple, informative, very easy to navigate, so you dont have to mess around.",5
25,I felt that the History of Mathematics Archive would be a valuable asset to any person who wishes to find a wide range of information available at a single site.  This archive has almost everything ranging from bibliographies and timelines to maps of birthplaces and famous quotes. This site would be a great teacher's resource for any teacher who wishes to lecture on a particular mathematician.  The brief definitions in the glossory index is also very convenient for finding a short and to the point definition of any mathematical terminology. ,5
25,I found that the Mac Tutor full of goodies. Something for everyone. The Biographis Indexs was easy to use and well writen. I pulled up two and read them. I then played in the famous curves Index. and completed my tour with History topics Indext: Egyptian Mathematics and the History of the Zero,5
25,"I've actually been to this website before, but didn't explore it as much as i did just now. I find MacTutor History well contained of informations. Just by browsing and reading some of the articles made me understood a lot of things. I didn't even know how they based when giving an award such as Nobel Price until I went to this website. There's so much other things that is helpful especially for students that are going to be writing a paper about Mathematicians, their achievements and basically everything about them. Having topics like Mathematics and Astronomy combined together is also a very excellent feature. This website is great itself for all the topic it offers and how it's a very good attraction to those who want to learn about Mathematicians.",5
25,"This site offers information, on top of information, on top of information. Excellent source of learning for any level of curiousity. If you want to know more just click on a link inbedded in article your reading continues. I stayed on this site for more than an hour. I started out in the History of Mayan Mathematics and ended up in Christianity and Mathematics.Technical Remarks:This site offers an extensive source of information. I found it easy to access -the only draw back with a site like this is trying to make a decision on a singular topic. Excellent resource for any topic in math.",5
25,"1)I spent about 15 min exploring this site. There is so much to explore on this site.2)The quality content on this site is very good. There is alot of resources. This site is very knowledgeable. It may seem overwhelming at first because there is so much. 3)This site should definetely enhance the effectiveness for students and teachers in the classroom. The reason being is because the site has a wide range of information on the history of math, mathemeticians, and I feel it woold be an excellent source for a student to get topics for research papers. 4)I feel that first time users browsing this site may feel overwhelmed at first. But it can be very useful if patient.",4
25,I enjoyed finding out about the history of mathamatics more then I knew before I came to this site on math history.  I did find it annoying getting sent to five other sites before I could find some history.  I believe this is one of the most frustrating things. I also found the Time Line Graph a bite hard to read but this could be me . On the positive side I did like the Time Line bullet info and will share this with my son.  I spent about 10 min. checking it out and really enjoyed the history. I really do want to come back to this site when I have more time.  Thanks for the history of math!  ,3
25,"This tutoring site was a very detailed and informative to both a student and a teacher. I browsed for about fifteen minutes and found some intersting things I can use for future refrences. I recomended this site for students looking for interesting topics to explore.Technical Remarks: I was really taken back by the math Astonomy and how everything in the universe ties into math it was kind of crazy,but in a good way.",5
25,"This tutoring guide was to say the least in depth.  It seemed to contain information about evrything.  Everything about this guide was easy, from the way it was setup to understanding the readings.  I very quickly browsed through the sight and I didn't use any of the learning activities.  It seemed that everything was accuratly covered.  I can see that this would be an effective learning tool for learning but it seems more of a resource then a teaching tool.  This one sight I picked was easy but the Merlot sight gave me a lot of trouble when I tried logging in.  I ended up having to come back to this sight on a different computer so I could log in.",5
25,This is a great site to find information on mathematicians. I must have spent over an hour just navigating through this site. A person could easily spend much more time than that just going through everything. It proved to be full of historical in depth information about many mathematicians. The set up was simple and easy to follow. This site is wonderful when a little history is needed behind the actual math work. The content seemed to be accurate and useful. There is no doubt that will make a great starting point when working on an assignment. ,4
25,"I SPENT A HALF HOUR REVIEWING THIS SITE AND LOOKING OVER ALL SORTS ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION. I FOUND A LOT OF INTERSESTING MATH REALTATED TOPICS THAT CAUGHT MY EYE, SINCE I HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT THATS COMING UP. THIS SITE HAS GREAT INFORMATION AND IS WRITTIN VERY NICE SO STUDENTS AND TEACHERS CAN BROSWE AND FIND WHAT THERE LOOKING FOR. IT ALSO GOES INTO DEPTH SO IT MAKES IT USEFUL WHEN DOING A PRESENTATION. THIS CAN ENHANCE BOTH THE TEACHER AND STUDENT TOGETHER. ITS VERY EASY TO USE AS FIST TIME USER. I AM GOING TO BOOK MARK AS WELL FOR FURTHER VIEWING. ",4
25,"I spent about 30 minutes browsing through this site, and one hour reading through the topics that interested me. I was mostly fascinated with the history of Egyptian Mathematics, and the Mathematical Astronomy. The organization of this site made it easier for a first time viewer like me to locate significant information I can use for my math class. In my opinion, I think this site is a good place to begin searching when looking for a math topic to present in class. First time users will find it easy to access and it contains pertinent information. ",4
26,"I have found this site to be very useful.  The tutorials are easy to follow and they make the visualization of cell division very clear.  I have used this website in the classroom while doing a lesson on Mitosis and the students really enjoyed the fact that they could see exactly what was happening during it.  I would recommend this site to any biology teacher or biology student.Technical Remarks: The site was fairly easy to follow.  Not as professionally done as some, but that didn't detract from its usefulness.",5
27,"Really great stuff for teaching physics. Interactive, clear simulations. Excellent.",5
27,"This site is highly recommended for use as either ""stand-alone"" simulated labs or as an effective instructional aid to class-room lectures. Most of the simulations are well-thought of and illustrate the main physical principles adequately.  The teaching notes provided by instructors who have already used the simulations are noteworthy and helpful. ",4
27,"This suite of applets and associated research are phenominal. I have been using them in my general physics courses for more than 4 years.You can use the apps in what I call ""experimental"" mode to try to generate some data and allow students to do their own.Technical Remarks:You probably want to download the java applets to avoid difficulties over a slow network, and then have to make sure your computers are setup properly, but once that is done, it is smooth sailing.",5
27,Simulations enhance students to learn physics by playing with them.,5
27,"The best part about Java/Flash applets is how well they support inquiry-based learning.  My student love exploring with them.  The Circuit construction kit is the best circuit simulator, hands-down!",5
27,Great animations with tons of lessons/handouts to choose from or work from. Covers tons of topics and the students love it!Technical Remarks:Animations can be downloaded to be used in your classroom even if you don't have internet!,5
27,Very easy to use. Great for visual learners,4
27,"Some of the BEST simulations on the web!!!! Easy to use, very interactive, and super graphics!!!!",5
27,Large collection of physics java applets.  Many are appropriate for high school use.,5
28,"A clear and detailed approach to explaining the concepts of academic integrity and plagiariarism. Of particular use for busy professors may be the quiz and resulting completion certificate (including student score) that may be emailed to the professor or student.Technical Remarks:Viewers may find they need to enlarge their screen display, as some of the text can appear quite small.",5
28,"As a one-stop, comprehensive resource about plagiarism, I love this material.  In my composition courses, we go over plagiarism in depth.  There are times, however, when I have such a brief touch with a student about plagiarism that a simple website recommendation is all I can offer.  I might meet someone in the university's computer lab or library.  The person is not in my class, but somehow plagiarism comes up in conversation.  I can recommend such a student to this excellent site.  It's attractive, engaging, and complete enough.Technical Remarks:Flash.",5
29,"Very nice! The various java animations enabled me to better understand many of the topics covered in physics. Nice doppler effect animation!Technical Remarks:This site was tested using Mac OS X, I just happen to be using Tiger (OS 10.4) right now, so the compatibility was seamless.",5
29,"Physlets are small, versatile building blocks that can be controlled by JavaScripts. Individual Physlets can intercommunicate; for example, the Animator4 physlet candisplay motion as the DataGraph4 physlet plots it. The details of how thisoccurs are controlled by your scripts, and thus may be completely customizedaccording to your pedagogical goals. More importantly, Phylets allow you to go beyond the typical Java simulationby creating applications that require active participation from thestudent.  Students can be asked to analyze motion using parameters thatmust be inferred from ""measurements"" taken from the computerscreen.The authors have recently published a bookthat provides a wealth of tutorial and pedagogical information.Technical Remarks:A Physlet only does what your scripts tell it to do.  Therefore the usability and effectiveness a particular Physlet application has much more to do with the associated scripts than with any particular Physlet. Getting started with your first Physlet application can be a bitdaunting.  The very best approach is to copy the source (just right-clickon the browser screen) from an application you want to use. You candownload the java archives (jar files) if you want to host the application onyour server.Most folks with just a bit of programming background will find it easy to modifyexisting scripts to produce customized applications.  The Physlet book andthe Physlet website have tons of example script to start with.",5
29,"My first comment was a little unfair, as I did not appreciate the utility of this site for physics educators on my first visit. Rather than being a mere tutorial on applets as I first described, this site contains very useful resources for those that want to incorporate physics-related applets into their curriculum.",4
30,"A lot of good information, but the text-embedded ads are distracting and could potentially be confusing to high-school students, who may think they are related to the element that they selected.  One ad in particular, looked like a quiz that could be interpreted as a site-related activity.  I also noticed some grammatical errors in the ""History of Carbon"" section that I attribute to some sort of ""find and replace"" programming issue.  It said ""Carbon was discovered by Known [sic] since ancient times although not recognized [sic] as an element until much later. at no data in not known.""  I get what it's trying to say, but it doesn’t make grammatical sense the way that it's structured.  Again, for high school students, this would be confusing.",3
30,"Wow!  I have used this site (prior to MERLOT membership) in class quite a bit...and on my own, as I was developing assignments or exams.  It's handy and reliable.  It's been accurate for every element I have used so far.  The periodic table is really the best ""cheat sheet"" for any chemistry class.  This one make the information behind the symbols very accessible to students.  The instant access is such a plus, and the depth of knowledge adds to its reliability.  I always caution my students on the use of web based information, and this was and is one site I have recommended to them.",5
30,"I don't teach G-Chem anymore but this is an excellent tool for any chemist.  I have a student that I am going to recommend this this to that is currently having trouble learing the periodic table.  This really brings it to life.Technical Remarks:I think that the page is a bit cluttered, but overall a very nice exercise.",4
30,This is a wonderful site. The site is loaded with great information. There is a lot of interesting facts about the periodic table including pictures and an audio option. The periodic table comes alive and would be a great resource for students to visit. It is also a great resource for teachers to gain valuable information when teaching the parts of the periodic table.Technical Remarks:This site is very easy to use. I had no problems maneuvering and clicking on the specific options they provide.,5
30,An excellent source of information on the chemical elements.  Easy to use with great graphs!!!,5
30,"An interactive periodic table with lots of information available for individual elements. Could be useful as a teaching tool, study aid or reference.",5
31,My students have benefitted from utilizing this resource as we begin the unit on digital storytelling.  They like to read material on this subject from a subject matter expert ... which also reinforces what I am sharing with them in the course.,5
31,"This website provides theory and methods for integrating digital storytelling into a course or curriculum. The why and the how are covered. It links digital storytelling to the history of storytelling in general, and gives plenty of examples.",5
31,"I loved the website, it was very attractive, easy to read and go through the website. The videos are very informative and detailed which answer if not many questions that I had not even thought of. Technical Remarks:should add more videos and topics",5
31,"As a resource for introducing students to the concept of digital storytelling, this site is top notch! All too often one finds resources that implicitly associate ""digital storytelling"" with one particular medium (e.g., video), but this site takes a broader approach in its definition, examples, and supporting resources. The ""More Web 2.0 Resources"" section is particularly impressive in that additional tools and articles seem to be added beyond the initial site design. (A criticism might be, though, that the remainder of the site is rather ""fixed"" in place and doesn't appear to be added to. This may result in datedness over time.)My students have commented that this site is the most helpful of the digital storytelling resources I've shared with them.",5
31,"This is a comprehensive website that can be used to give educators a thorough understanding of the potential uses of digital storytelling in the classroom. The website is clear and easy to navigate and the opening example is engaging and will draw educators into the potential of using digital storytelling in a classroom. 

This website is comprehensive and provides not only the pedagogical information about why these projects are beneficial for students and teachers, but also provides technical information of concern to many educators such as what software is needed to produce these projects and even discusses copyright & legal issues.",5
32,"Excellent, informative material, written with a great sense of humor and passionfor educating! Thanks",5
32,"I enjoyed the author's humor. I believe students would relate to the easy, non-threatening tone of this material.",4
32,"I though that this learning object was ok.  I admit I did not spend time going through all of the available lessons, but I was not excited with the several I observed and it felt like a bad video game- cool concept but it just doesn't run smoothly or feel like you paid top dollar for it.  In some lessons it was informative, interactive and easy to use, but I felt that most were composed too quickly and that fewer lessons with more quality would be better. Overall I liked the idea but I think that it fell a bit short in its goals.  It would probably not be something that I recommend to my students for further learning but it has potential.Technical Remarks:It has several animations that make visualizing the concepts easier.  It is hard to navigate because there are too may links at the bottom.  The simulations were ""ok"" but could be much better/ faster/ visual oriented. The lecture/Presentation material was ok because it has lots of great information in it but it also has some distracting dialogue as well.",3
32,I thought this site provided lots of useful information about the different minds. It has interesting stories and information about the minds and why certain things are the way they are.,3
32,"This is a great site for exploring the mind.  This site distinguishes different divisions of the mind and provides stories, information, and ""adventures"" which makes learning fun! I love how interactive this site is!  It is great!Technical Remarks: I love how interactive this site is.  It is not black and white and boring like some sites can be.",5
33,The presentation is a great tool to use as a refresher for nursing students. I especially like the hyperlinked features to see the section of the brain. I enjoyed looking through the presentation and plan to return later.Technical Remarks:I was able to easily navigate in the site.,5
33,This is a great resource to help students understand the brain and processing.  I use this in my Introductory Psychology course and students really do spend time navigating through the resource.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate and use.,5
33,"This is an impressive site with a great deal of detail. I liked the engaging questions including ""Why do I say so many stupid things when I am drunk?"" Engaging. I appreciated having three levels of explanation.Technical Remarks:I found the site easy to navigate.",5
33,"After taking a thorough look at this psychology learning object, I find it to be very informative, accurate, and comprehensive on multiple developmental levels for various disciplines on a variety of topics.  In assessing this presentation/lecture material from a psychology standpoint, it is even better because having information from multiple disciplines facilitates a more thorough psychology experience (i.e. using both the Neurological, Social, and Psychological presentations on ""From the Simple to the Complex"").  Overall this site is a great resource, however, to use it to supplement (instead of replace) teaching students the material may be tricky.  Also, what separates this site from a lecture or any text book is the option of different difficulty levels that allow struggling students to choose an easier level if confused and then return to the level they should be learning at.  What a great resource for presenting material!Technical Remarks:Although the LO is great in the presentation/lecture format, it is not very interactive.  Other more interactive functions could really boost the appeal of it.  Quizzes with feedback, flashcard options, and tutorials should be considered to make this the most appealing resource for students.",5
33,"This is a very well organized site with extensive information on the brain. There are also clear, colorful diagrams included. 

I especially liked the ""bread crumb"" navigation cards listing topics and subtopics. 

This site is original in that it presents not just scientific information on the brain but also social and cultural information as well. 

This is a tremendous resource for people with all types of interests. I like the cross discipline approach, a very thorough approach for the subject matter.",5
33,"Because of how well the website is designed, it showed how much effort the author took in making the information less dense and more entertaining and informative.",5
33,This is overall an excellent site that I have recommended to students and associates.  However the inaccurate and superficial article about the culture of fear in the U.S. is a real blemish.  This is an important topic in social psychology that deserves examination not a poorly written and narrow political statement.  That article is a blemish on an otherwise excellent site.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate in a logical and straight-forward fashion.,4
34,"I think the this is a great and concise resource for students learning about different types of publication. The narrator is clearly audible and the graphics engaging. The auto-captioning is perfectly serviceable, and I think that the creator does a good job of discussing trade literature.",4
34,"It's no wonder this material has been awarded the Merlot Classic designation.  The material is excellent and clearly presented.  The topic is a timely one for the audience for which it is intended, and the quality of production first-rate.  The animation is hardly staid and should be appealing to the college-aged.  Figures in the tutorial do not simply present a statuesque appearance, but interact ever so slightly with the voice- over.  The voice-over itself is resonant and easily understandable, the diction precise, and the intonation appropriately emphasized.  Users of this materal should not only find it engaging but also humorous.  While the examples are to the point, the are also cleverly self-mocking of the sometimes ponderousness of academe.",5
34,Well written and illustrated presentation on the differences between scholarly and popular serials.  It is short enought to keep the attention of students while opening up opportunities to explain more about the gray areas mentioned.,4
34,"This is a nice, easy to follow video.  The length of the video is appropriate.  It does an excellent job of reviewing key points to consider when reviewing popular vs. scholarly materials.  This is an effective resource to use when working with students.Technical Remarks:Easy to use.  No technical difficulties encountered.  Close captioning for ADA compliance would make this tutorial outstanding.",4
34,"Good discussion of source material, could be strengthened by consideration of commercial and educational sites, which are not peer reviewed, but many students will feel should be authoritative.  However, this would make excellent material to provide the basis of a seminar to promote discussion and understanding of scholarly work.Technical Remarks:Very easy to use",4
34,Topic (Magazine vs. Journal) was explained in a succinct and easy to understand manner.  High school students would greatly benefit.,4
34,I use video in most of the library instruction classes that I do. I have found it to be very effective and engaging for students. It is very short and helps to break up the class time. I also try to bring actual print periodicals to pass around to enforce the video. Highly recommended!,5
34,"Nice video that uses simply, engaging graphics. The content covers key issues students should know about popular versus scholarly sources.Technical Remarks:The video displayed without problems. One consideration is that captioning would make content available to students with hearing impairments.",4
34,Nice video that explains the differences between scholarly journals and popular magazines.,5
35,Not only is this software an excellent stand-alone package; integrating it into textbooks and MyStatLab is a very powerful teaching tool. It has numerous pedagogical applications in addition to statistical analyses. The ability for students to open a data set from a homework or assignment directly into StatCrunch solves a major problem in simply getting the data ready for analysis.,5
35,"I really like using StatCrunch in my online Statistics course. Students can use the applications anywhere they are and on any platform. The students really became engaged in the material when they were able to create their own survey, collect their own data, and make their own decisions based on the analysis. I highly recommend using the survey building option within StatCrunch.",5
35,"StatCrunch seems as if it would be a great resource for students who want to do statistics on their research.  However, the software is only available to those who have a Pearson Education Account. Technical Remarks:I do have a Pearson Education account and tried to sign up for access.  Unfortunately, I am not currently teaching a Statistics course.  Therefore, I was unable to actually try out the software given there was no textbook information.",3
35,"I love StatCrunch and have used it for years. My Statistical Methods online class used it for the past two semesters to make graphs of all types and do regression analysis. They were all able to make, copy, and use the output from StatCrunch. It is very easy to learn and use and well worth the subscription price. I also use StatCrunch for my own statistical analysis and to make graphics for teaching at all levels of Statistics.Technical Remarks:Easy to use, versatile, accurate. The online storage space for data sets is generous and the new abilities to share data sets and reports with other users is a great feature.",5
35,"WebStat is a great statistical computing site for comparitive data analysis with various language based capabilities.  I was able to view a demo on existing gathered sample data, read thru procedural instructions on how to generate and display statistical results using plots, graphs, charts, and table information to show your data effectively.Technical Remarks: Even though I found the site to be navigationally easier than most, please ignore my earlier 9/29 posted comment of ""testing 1, 2, 3 ..."" I wanted to make sure today I was able to post my comments. On 9/28 evening I attempted two times to post my comments about this site and I was unable to do so.  Perhaps due to technical difficulties ... anyway, I do however believe this site is very user friendly otherwise, offering additional computer based language program interfaces and capabilities for www access.",5
35,Java based software package that allows user to solve some statistical problems only using browser only. A good tool for a student who does not have an access to comercial statistics software packages.Technical Remarks: A very friendly interface.,5
36,"I spent 5 min. browsing, but I do feel that the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant. I feel there is a high level of effectiveness for enhancing teacher and student learning. I found it easy to use this software.",5
36,I spent about 30 minutes looing through this site. I like the idea of having kids use 3-D glasses because it is a fun activity students will enjoy. Students can definitely learn from this material and all the materials are easy to use no matter what grade it may be used for.,4
36,"The peer reviewers worked with the author to develop the following snapshot about the paper project.Technical Remarks:This site offers many opportunities to use 3-D glasses.   If you don't have any, instructions for making them are available at the site.",5
37,"The amount of information here for US History classes in particular is priceless. Primary documentation is rarely so easy to find, or catalogued in a manner that is so user friendly. I see these materials as being valuable both as research sources and as springboards for discussions on a host of American History topics.Technical Remarks:The site is easy to navigate, but even better is the link that describes how materials are organized, for those who might be intimidated by the initial presentation.",5
37,"Valley of the Shadows is a web site that deals with primary resources to tell the story of two towns before, during, and after the Civil War.  The wealth of knowledge that history enthusiasts can gain from this web site is incredible.  The primary information seems endless.  Examining the primary information is a rewarding experience that is made easy with the wealth of information that is available.  The interactivity creates an excellent learning experience for visual learners.   Technical Remarks: The maps clearly excel with technical value.  The web site is a work of art when you consider the development of the overall plan of the site.  The site map is unique and easy to use.  The information that is available from the site is clearly laid in such a way that you don?t feel overwhelmed or confused.  The lesson plans that are available will make this work of art, easy to use in a classroom.   The site is geared more for college but those in the secondary schools that can take the time to analyze the information may be able to use the material.  The web site can be used over and over again to find valuable information for any topic that deals with this time period.     ",5
37,"Winner of the 2001 eLincoln award given to distinguished Civil War historical projects annually through Gettysburg College, created under the guidance of the respected historian Edward L. Ayers (and others) Valley in the Shadow is one many University of Virginia anchored historical sites that provide first rate scholarly resources for instructors and students. Not only does this site serve as a window into antebellum and Civil War era lifeways and culture through primary materials from Virginia's Augusta County and Franklin County, Pennsylvania, the creators also saw fit to provide grammar school, high school, and college level learning objects--for creative writing and traditional essay lessons, each with several possible subjects. The materials digitized for the site include periodicals, letters, diaries, photographs, maps, church records, population census, agricultural census, and military records. Women, African Americans, farmers, politicians, soldiers, and families are represented. The site provides for easy navigation and is separated into antebellum sources and those covering the war years. Subjects include death and dying, defenses of slavery, post-emancipation lifeways, attitudes about slavery, occupations of the 1860s, debates over secession and unionism, the impact of railroads, German and Irish immigration, and many others subjects.

38,"I would highly recommend this material, it is visually appealing and easy to navigate.Technical Remarks:Good Quality materials, information is thoroughly researched. The use of flash player is key to using this site.",5
38,"For students and for historians who teach, this lovely, user friendly, and engagingly considered introduction into the world of the Vikings stands as one of the finest examples of learning objects found on the internet. The quality of the material is first rate and up to date and relies on a combined use of myriad resources archeological, environmental, genetics and saga studies based, and those convential to provide a fresh approach to the subject.  Browers may opt to use animated Flash pluggins to view the site or frames based means. The site's clear discussions and bright colorful imagery allows instructors to use the site in class or to augment online instruction. Furthermore, the site contains no premade assignments or learning modules, such tools can be easily constructed around the use of this site as it allows for many different perspectives on the Vikings. Maps, animation, discussions of domestic lifeways, and the significance of Viking travels and deeds are all here. If any I were to issue any caveat about the site, it would be a warning that instructors avoid the temptation to request that students simply use the site without any additional instructor comment whatsoever. WSTechnical Remarks:Flash pluggins recommended, but not required.",5
38,"This Smithsonian Institute site is both fun and informative. It can reach both traditional learners who like to read facts as well as those newer users who need multimedia elements to be truly motivated.  Movies, sounds, images, and map that you can navigate with a Viking ship.Technical Remarks: A bit intensive for those with slow connection speeds or lack of plug-ins but the plug-ins appear to be fairly standard ones.",5
39,I really liked how engaging and thorough the resource was.  I believe it would be a great learning tool!,5
39,"This is an excellent resource and badly needed. The material offers a way for students to wade into the process of archival research, which is often too time intensive to approach during a semester. This site allows instructors to give students a taste of this work, without taking time away from the teaching of other important research methods.Technical Remarks:The site works well and the links appear to be in good order",5
39,"This was an amazing site.  I was just looking at all the articles on merlot and found this site and it was so interesting to read.  It makes you wonder who really did do the killings, was someone put to death that was not guilty?  And what happened to the real killers.",5
39,"MERLOT Web Site: Who Killed William Robinson?Overview: After a 20 minute navigation of the web site, I was impressed how this web site invited viewers to explore original historical documents about the unsolved murder case of black American William Robinson in British Columbia in 1868.  The documents included newspaper stories, inquests, trial documents, private correspondence, diaries, paintings, artist's reconstructions and photographs.  The site invited learners to interpret the raw materials of the past to develop an historical understanding about what actually happened in the past. The overall goal of the site was to define and understand the role of primary sources in historical research. The primary audience was college-level students, but this site could easily be used by high school students.Strengths: The site is an excellent teaching and learning tool. Through reviewing some primary sources, learners are invited to engage in historical research whose goal is to interpret the sources to be able to draw some substantiated conclusions about who did murder William Robinson. The accessibility to excellent primary sources is well done, and the task encourages the learners to engage in critical thinking.  The navigation throughout the site is clear and easy to follow, too. The menu bar at the top and the references on the left are easy to use.Concerns: My concerns are only a few. One portion of the site requires using a password that only the designers of the site can  provide in order to view certain interpretation sections. The designers do, however, include their email address on the site,
 so a learner can email them requesting the password.  The site might be more effective if the learning objectives were clearly posted on the website as part of the beginning of the task.Technical Remarks:I was impressed by how easy it was to have ready access to primary sources in a clean, simple web site design. The enlargement of the tumbnail images and maps was well done.",5
39,"I spent about 45 minutes exploring this resource, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It provides a window into 19th centurycolonial life in British Columbia by looking explicitly at a historical murder mystery. The murder provides an engaging context from which to explore what amounts to a treasure trove of primary source information surrounding the case itself as well as more general sources whichanchor the story in a specific time and place. Information about the settlement of BC and Canada, the importance of land, the dispossession of aboriginal people, justice, racism,family life, relgion etc in 19th century Canada can be explored via the primary source material.  It is student-centred in its approach -- users can choose their own path through the materials, and draw their own conclusions from the vast array of primary source information available. Critical thinking skills are engaged in the final section, ""Interpretation"" which provides links to secondary source material, documenting how historians have traditionally viewed the case.  Part of the excellence of this resource is that the learner has direct and immediate access to the primary source material on which the interpretations were based, enabling them to critically evaluate the conclusions drawn by the experts. This section is password-protected --I assume passwords can be obtained from the authors.I think this is an excellent resource for history instructors--excellent quality, a well-designed interface, an archive of primary sourcematerial available to the learner to explore as s/he needs it. Discovery is left entirely up to the learner.  The interface is simple to navigate and instructions are clear and readilyavailable. Technical Remarks: The interface is simple to navigate and instructions are clear and readilyavailable. ",5
40,"I viewed the Data Interpretation Lesson which can be adapted for use in biology courses outside of water management.  It appears an effective lesson for getting students to think about, analyze, and manipulate data to solve a problem, a core skill for any discipline.Technical Remarks:It took some time to learn how to navigate the site, ie it was a little difficult to switch between the ""studying"" lesson, the ""investigating"" lesson, the data, and the""teaching"" lesson plan",5
40,A very thorough and complete study.  I will definitely use this in my environmental class.Technical Remarks:It does appear as if the editors are updating and keeping information current.,4
41,"This site offers students an excellent introduction into historical research and analysis through the use of primary sources.  The site has great potential as a teaching and learning tool, however, it is limited to a specific subtopic within the late colonial period in American history.  The site is rather easy to navigate and offers some rather clever tools to aid the user in perusing the site's primary documents.",4
41,This site provides an excellent tool for teaching students about the work of historians.  Especially interesting is the inclusion of the actual diary pages that students get to decipher.  The historical toolkit also is useful in providing a step-by-step overview of historical interpretation.Technical Remarks:Navigating the site is a bit of a challenge.  Attempts to view the film clips also presented some techical difficulties.,4
42,"4.	Merlot, as you already know is a fantastic site. The site has all sorts of educational information.  You can become a member for free. Member benefits include being able to share your own expertise, contribute learning materials and receive peer recognition.  This site even has examples of assignments that teachers can utilize in their own classroom.  Very easy site to use, easy to read and explore.",4
42,This site has been a great tool for me and I'm very pleased that Mr. Rutledge allowed our class to experience this site because I know that I will continue to use it. This site provides us with many resources that I can continue to use through out my career and I will tell others about this site as well.,5
43,"I expected a more global approach as opposed to a piecemeal approach to the subject. This site is good for a specific area such as naming a new product, but does not offer a global perspective of the whole successful process.",3
43,"I will eventually use this website in the future, hopefully this fall. I feel that more information that is used through technology for the students while learning about marketing and advertising helps the students engage in the outcomes of the learning process as a whole. I really like this website!Technical Remarks:Easy enough considering the amount of computers and Internet software that is provided through the school.",4
44,"Part three of three excellent interactive exercises on microevolution. The student is required to interpret data. If wrong answer submitted, they have to go back and redo the section. Well organized and accurate.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash player",5
44,This website contains tremendous amount of ressources for students independant practice. It lays out a steps by steps aproach in teaching evolution. it has a lot of interactive activities that will help student mater microevolution and selection in a given ecosystem. I could use this website in my teaching of natural selection to compile activities for my students. Can also direct students to the website to practice a specific concept for homework. It also have a lot of links to other websites that shows the same concept.,4
44,"A really useful interactive exercise to encourage students to think about selection pressures and work out allele frequencies over three generations. Technical Remarks:Last slide slightly confusing as it invites viewer to click on forward  arrow for next.  However, this is different to all preceeding slides,  and the arrow it refers to is NOT on the slide but above it.   A small  hiccup in an otherwise great presentation.",4
45,"I use this in the classroom, for creating new web materials, for creating images for testing, and give student assignments where they are required to create their own GeoGebra applets.  Student reviews are consistently very high, for this software.",5
46,This is a good material it needs some modification,3
46,"The lay-out is unique in that it shows the inter-connectedness of several areas of physics. I have not used this site in my classes personally, but was wondering if other instructors stress this aspect (regarding the sub-fields being interlinked) to their students!",4
46,Great reference!  Explains concepts at intro college level. (Wikipedia is too technical for most students.)  Concept map layout is easy to navigate.,5
46,The comprehensive nature of this site is fantastic.  Students have an easy time finding the information that they need and seem to like to use it for that extra explanation.,5
47,"I've found Jing to be very useful in creating short videos explaining assignments to students or to create ""how to"" videos on technology applications (e.g. how to create a hyperlink in PowerPoint).",4
47,"When I click the ""Go to Material"" link, it is supposed to take me to the project (jingproject.com).  I instead am taken to the Jing website.  There, I can locate a series of tutorials.  Is this correct or was I supposed to be able to view a tutorial that you created?",2
47,"Jing is a very useful tool for showing online learners videos and screenshots of how to do something. It is especially useful when teaching computer science, web development, or design classes.Technical Remarks:Sometimes there are bandwidth problems with the free version. Videos can be no longer than 5 minutes. This issue can be avoided with a subscription.",4
47,"Jing is fabulous for having both instructors and students capture screen visualizations, but is highly limited by the amount of time for the recording (5 minutes or less) and the lack of the editing features of free competitors such as CamStudio.  Still, given the price tag and ease of access, it serves as a potential tool in the instructor tool belt for giving students another channel for dialogue and meaningful feedback.",3
47,It took me some time to realize that all there is to this entry is the link to the Jing tool itself. There needs to be some instruction around this entry. Perhaps providing an example too.,2
47,"I was disappointed in this resource because it was simply a copy of what could be found on the product website.I love using the product, Jing, for short screencasts.I think that this would have been a much more effective learning tool if it incorporated screencasts in the tutorial--demonstrating how Jing works.",2
47,This is a good application. The free version only gives you a small amount of time to make your point (5 minutes). You will need to be concise when recording your video.,4
47,Jing is a remarkable tool that allows the user to capture a screenshot or cast.  It's excellent to use in explaining technology to students or explaining technological errors to help desks!Technical Remarks:Easy to use on Mac or PC.,5

49,"This site is excellent as a teaching tool for students who are not familiar with Linux. I spent about 1 hour browsing through the various sections of each module and I was very impressed. The modules are very elementary, but for beginning Linux students, this would be an excellent way to learn the commands.  It is easy to use and the students are given the opportunity to practice the commands, with immediate feedback on their success.  There are also intermediate quizzes as well as an end of module quiz to test their skills.Technical Remarks: The site uses pop-up windows for feedback and uses a good combination of text in the left window with an actual Linux command line in the right window.",5
49,I spent approximately 1 hour exploring the materials related to this interactive tutorial. I have the quality of the content to be great even though it was limited -- it succeeds at covering the tip of the iceberg but has great potential of going even further.  I belive that this would be a great enhancement to any course where a student needs to become familiar with the Linux operating system.  The modules where easy to use and set up for both the Linux and WinTel operating systems although they may be available for other operating systems in the future.Technical Remarks: The modules where easy to use and set up for both the Linux and WinTel operating systems although they may be available for other operating systems in the future.  Each module comes with interactive activities and a self-test quiz that reveals the answers when you are finished.,5
50,Sadly the physical Newseum location closed in 2019. There are still three online resource exhibits that are available to utilize. One of these is Today's Front Pages where newspapers from all over the world submit their daily headlines to the site. The remaining content in this site would be effective to provide additional resources or information about specific topics covered. Learners engaged in this material would need specific support and guidance from their instructor. The interface is easy to navigate and understand but there is not much information included on the website any more.,3
50,This will be great for my history teachers - great resource.,5
50,Site offers uses for pre-service and in-service teachers who can and cannot make the actual trip to the newseum. There are pre visit portals as well as lesson ideas for actual trips and for those not able to make the trip the lessons make use of newseum materials with links to current and past news items. Great way to get 7-12 students to integrate Enlgish and social studies skills/content in one project/assignment.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate and openlinks. Materials on site do not require any advanced skills or applications.,5
51,Outstanding!  Visually appealing with tons of detailed information.  This can be used in multiple courses.,5
51,I think that this is a great resource. My only issues with the site is that I wish there was a little more visual effects with the table. It would be nice if you could make it so that when the cursor goes over an element a quick bio pops up. This will help make the table a little more interactive.,3
51,"Great tool for students to understand periodic table. The pictures and explanations help to make connections, and therefore, have a better understanding of elements.",4
51,"Excellent resource for students to navigate around the Periodic Table.  I always tell them that if they can get to know the Table, they'll have less use for my class!Technical Remarks:Some of the apps require quicktime video.",4
51,"This is a great tool! Very complete in information and love that they have a picture of the element when possible. Only concern is that there is too much information for younger students to sift through, but great resource.",5
51,If you want a periodic table that really comes to life you can find it at http://www.periodicvideos.com/,3
51,"This is a tremendously useful website for any grade!  I looked at just about every element on the site and found out many different facts that I never learned while I was in school.  There was a significant amount of interesting and seemingly useful information for each element that I clicked on.Technical Remarks:The site is very easy to use and could wind up being quite addicting to students who use it to their advantage for research, projects, etc.",5
52,Awesome tool interacting with how plants work!,5
52,"This site is tremendous for both  teachers and pupils.It is a great site because I am edified  and  entertained with the movies and  flipcharts  to teach the topic:""Plants. These materials have assisted me to  have a wider knowledge  to teach this topic in the classroom. I am encouraging teachers and pupils to take full advantage of this site because it is an award winning site.",5
52,This is a great site to learn about all sorts of plant movement.  Great animations.,5
52,great site on plants in motion and growth of plants from seed to plant or root to plant,5
52,I spent about 40 minutes browsing this site. I would like to use some of the videos for the lectures that involve plants. I like very much about the movie categories. Each vocabulary it has its own video clip. Students can define the meaning by seeing the motion pictures. I so love the part of “plants in Hollywood”. The movies that relate to plants definitely motivate students’ learning desire.,5
52,Videos help understand by seeing plants movements. Good combination of videos with the relevant information about what you are seeing.,4
52,"Excellent-it shoes real, live plants using time lapse video.",5
52,I spend around 2 hours reviewing this site and found it very interesting.  I would like to use this in an Into Biology class and have the students perform something similar to the time lapse movies.  I feel students being involved with the process would enhance their learning experience.  The site was very user friendly.,4
52,"I spent about an hour reviewing the movies.  I think that this site has a lot of potential to be used in the classroom.  I would like to use it for an introductory biology course.  I think it would be a good way to kick off a unit and generate student interest.  The site was very easy to use, and the movies loaded quickly.",4
52,"I spent about 1 1/2 hours reviewing movies  for most topics included.  From my T1 connection, most movies loaded in less than 10 seconds.  From my 56K modem at home some of the movies took over 5 minutes to load.  Aside from the slow loading, the videos were excellent!    I plan to use this site for my online non-majors biology class and for my general  botany class.  I anticipate that my students will be amazed at the videos and be more interested in plants as a result of viewing the videos.  The materials are easy to use, of high quality, and should enhance the educational experiences of my students.  ",4
52,"I used this site in teaching a graduate level education course in plant sciences.  The animations of the tropisms are excellent.  I asked class members to create assignments based on the Quicktime movies available on the site.  This proved challenging for them.  However, they were very excited about the opportunity to discuss complicated plant responses based on a movie.",4
53,"   the worldatlas : This material was very usefull  for me as I am learning about "" learning objects"", what are they, its importance, its  design ,  and why they  are  necessary to add them in my  lesson plans. 
I want to share the comment  because I agree that  this is a good learning object because students could go to this site and learn something without being supervised by a teacher. The site is full of fun facts and information that is easy to get to. Students can find flags, maps of oceans and countries, and learn vocabulary that will benefit their learning. Teachers can find printable maps, and valuable information on any country. The website is engaging to all who come across it. It is aesthetically pleasing and fun to use. There are games, quizzes, graphics, and fun facts that will keep the attention of students and teachers alike.",4
53,"This a remarkable, outstanding site to learn about the origin of WebQuests, search for existing WebQuests, and create your own WebQuests. I spent several hours over two sessions browsing through all of the material and many of the links associated with this site (did not look at all existing WebQuests, but did extensive meandering through the what, how, and why of WebQuests).

The quality of content is superb. While clicking through a plethora of information, I came across and viewed 53 slides built by Bernie Dodge, titled: Overcoming Obstacles to Quicker WebQuest Creation. This PowerPoint gave me great insight into the evolution and on-going process of WebQuest design and solutions; mentions available WebQuest authoring tools (including links) and current WebQuest authoring environments (also linked); and lists the many features of WebQuest Garden. The concepts and models are educationally significant to all potentail users and creaters of WebQuests.

If used appropriately, student learning and faculty's teaching will be significantly enhanced. The information presented on this site gives an educator the knowledge, resources, and ability to create WebQuests that will technologically engage today's learners in ways that intrique them and make them use higher order thinking. If an educator doesn't have the time to create a WebQuest, he/she can easily search the database on QuestGarden to find materials that will enhance the learning experience in their classroom.Technical Remarks:A few links did not work on the older linked sites. In almost every instance, there was a message at the top of the page stating that all links may not be working. 

The materials on this site were very easy to use and I feel a novice user would find it easy to navigate around QuestGarden. I very much enjoyed this site and am very thankful I found it. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in locating existing materials or creating a site of their own. The site is free to use. However, if you'd like to create your own WebQuest and add it to the QuestGarden database you need to subscribe for the nominal price of $20. That will get you a two year subscription and will also allow you to modify existing WebQuests to fit your classroom needs.",5

56,"As we prepare to offer an E-Commerce Business Ethics course in the fall, we are reviewing many materials, and this case study has great possibilities for student engagement and thorough discussion. Students can read the case studies and relate in-person or online using ZOOM or asynchronous.   The professor can use the case studies by helping the students to relate to their situations and/or environments.",5
56,"Each of 4 cases offers videos (and text transcripts) for students to review. Questions for discussion are included. Many of the ethical issues presented (e-commerce security, website credibility, privacy) will be interesting and relevant to students. A comprehensive list of links provide a starting place for student research and discussion.Technical Remarks:Text transcripts available for all videos.",4
56,"While I am assembling my course itinerary for this fall session, I going to incorporate this as an exercise each week. I can foresee this generating some interesting discussions and I intend on forming groups to take varying positions of each of the classes presented.",5
56,Engaging use of case scenarios to apply ethical decision making.Technical Remarks:Use of technology including video clips and visual features adds to the quality of this material.,5
56,Good case studies. Currently teaching business ethics. If I get to teach e-business then this will be good information to have some case studies incorporated into the course.,4
56,"This learning object is extremely well designed, engaging, and entertaining (especially the humorous names of the fictional employees).   The 4 cases are directly relevant to ethical decisions in the current e-commerce environment.  Although the issues are e-commerce related, the presentation would easily adapt to any course dealing with ethical decision making.Technical Remarks:The choice to do still-frame flash animation with audio was extremely wise, and the model would be easy to extend.  I am very impressed with the choice of design and the parallel structures the materials in all four cases provided.",5
56,The students really enjoyed working on these case studies in groups. They provided a chance for the students to apply their e-commerce knowledge to a new situation.,5
57,There is so much to be learned in the area of integrating technology into the classroom.  Richard Byrne's blog is a wonderful resource for educators at all levels.  Highly recommended!,4
57,"Excellent resource for finding and using technology in teaching. Includes iOS and Android devices, and Google tutorials.",4
57,Great tips on this site.Technical Remarks:Could use a different site design. The site is real cluttered. ,3

59,"Very readable, but detailed information on these endocrine glands; used nice diagrams and picture to compliment the narrative explanation",4
60,"This is a terrific source for protein and small biomolecule structures (lipids, carbohydrates). The site has a tremendous amount of useful material that is well organized and easy to navigate. Tools to create molecular images are also included. The “Structure to Function” area is a great resource for information about specific topics. I noticed that the Krebs Cycle overview page began with an out-of-place figure (TGFbeta signaling pathway instead of citric acid cycle), but this was a rare and minor problem.  I especially liked the inclusion of Video Guide and Help links for new users.",5

61,"This is a neatly laid out, interactive, and well-illustrated account of the Raid on Deerfield in 1704. The organization of the website allows users to explore the event either in chronological order, thematically, or by simply browsing through the wealth of illustrations, explanations, and background information. The reconstruction of the Raid on Deerfield allows users to find out about the multiple (cultural, economic, geopolitical) contexts that came to play in the conflict, and lets them piece together their own interpretation.The home page and the video introduction do a commendable job of explaining what is at stake in revisiting this historical event through this case study. Also, the website balances judiciously between the English, French Mohawk, Huron, and Wobanaki perspectives in the Raid on Deerfield, and offers ample background history on all of these groups. The glossary, bibliography, timeline, and maps make this website not just a compelling case study/tutorial, but also a more widely usable resource on the interaction between European and Native American people in colonial New England. Technical Remarks:The website has a clear and appealing layout, and is easy to navigate. Most of the texts contain useful hyperlinks to the glossary and maps.",5

61,I am planning to use this site in an assignment in my college-level U.S. history survey course in Fall 2008.  I particularly like that the three Indian groups and the French each receive as much attention as the English perspective.  I also like that the site provides considerable background information so that the Raid in 1704 does not appear out of context.,4

Well done.",5
62,The outline represents a strong knowledge of the fundamentals and serves as an excellent supplement. It offers a wide variety of learning activities that promote group discussion and reflect levels that are appropriate for the concepts presented. I especially like that it includes situational leadership.,5
62,"I have seen pieces of this before while searching the internet.  Now that I have seen the full site, I know I will use it for myself and for students.  I teach in a Leadership minor program and I enjoyed the learning activities the site provides.  I am particularly happy that leadership is not confused with management here.  Both are useful in an organization, but they are different.",5
62,Materials are well organized and cover a wide variety of foundation elements for leadership analysis and self assessment tools.  Small group disucssions using Bolman & Deal's four frame model were especially relevant.Technical Remarks:Materials all opened without difficulty.,5

64,This was a great website used to reiterate or review topics. It was also useful to add to webpages so students have the lessons notes to help with homework outside of the classroom. I also found this to be great because there were YouTube videos along with 2 other versions of videos depending on the individual's preference. This website suits not only spatial learners but visual/auditory learners as well. Great site to assist various students and learners.,4
64,"This  resource caters to both the visual and auditory learner. I loved the variety of learning materials: class notes, video, quiz. I believe students will find the resource engaging.

I also liked that the video not only provided audio, but subtitles. This would allow students will visual and auditory disabilities to follow along with the video. I also liked how there were different versions of the topic quiz. This could prevent cheating amongst students, but also provide a student with another opportunity to test their knowledge of the topic if they weren't success the first time. I think that is great that students are able to use this material at their own pace. i could see myself using this as supplemental material for my lessons if a student was struggling or wanting extra practice with a specific concept. ",4

66,"I don't know much about quantum mechanics but, after reviewing these wonderful websites I'm willing to take a chance and learn a little more.",4
66,"Having had a first course in undergraduate quantum mechanics I found Manuel Joffre?s wave mechanics physlets to be at most supplementary in nature but at the same time rather enlightening. The wave-particle duality physlet provides a simulation of the well known double slit experiment. The simulation provides two windows. The first window serves as a backdrop revealing the interference pattern that characterizes the wave behavior of particles passing through a two slit barrier. The second window serves as a histogram for each shot registered at a particular channel/detector on the backdrop. The author does well in asking the user to make qualitative and quantitative assessments as to why the relative noise in the per channel histogram decreases with sample size. This really forces the all important notion of statistical procedure associated with quantum mechanics.In this double slit simulation, the user may vary two aspects of the experiment: the rate at which particles are fired and the number of fringes to be observed.  Some comments might be in order concerning the option for fringe variation. When a double slit experiment is performed in the laboratory, there are certain parameters that must be varied to produce a different number of fringes. Having presented the option for fringe variation in the simulation, it seems natural to provide some instructional comments as to why fringe variation is possible and how it relates to wave theory and experiment.In the second physlet, Joffre presents a simulation of the propagation of a free wave packet in a dispersive medium. The simulation provides an excellent visualization of the spreading /dispersion of a wavepacket as it propagates through space. As in the double slit simulation,
 this simulation has a dual window presentation. The simulation allows the user to toggle between two different representations of the same wave packet as it moves and disperses through space. The first representation is the probability density associated with the wave packet in configuration space. The second representation is the actual physical wave packet itself or the real part of the packets wave function. By toggling between these two representations the user may develop some intuition as to how a probability density in configuration space relates to the physical propagation/dispersion of a wave packet in space. In short, this dual representation offers an excellent opportunity to develop some physical interpretation of a probability density. The author offers some instructional comments concerning the spreading of the wave packet and its probability density  in momentum space. While the comments are instructive, perhaps a third representation of the wave packet  in momentum space would be most enlightening. In conjunction with the configuration space and real/physical representations , a third representation in momentum space might allow the user to form a more complete picture of the motion of a wave packet and its associated probability densities.The next of Joffre?s simulations presents a particle of fixed energy relative to potential steps and barriers of various energies. In the case of potential steps the user may vary the step potential and then observe the differences in transmission and reflection probabilities. Probability densities are plotted versus position. The simulation is extremely effective in conveying the idea  of how step potentials of various energies affect probabilities of reflection/transmission. In the case of finite potential barriers,
 the user may vary only the barrier width and not the barrier height. This is somewhat unfortunate as both barrier height and barrier width determine transmission/reflection probabilities. This dual dependence on height and width seems to be obscured by restricting the users ability to vary only barrier width.The final simulation in this wave mechanics applet brings us back tothe laboratory with an interactive demonstration of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Here, the user traces out the surface of some sample by varying the height of the STM. As the STM traverses across the surface of the sample, electrons tunnel into the microscope?s tip through a Coulomb potential due to the sample?s nuclei and thus generate a measurable current. The user has the task of keeping the measured current constant by varying the height of the STM as it moves across the sample. The interactive nature of this simulation gives the user a good idea of how an STM works and what it measures. What seems to be lacking here are some contextual comments on how the measurements might be interpreted and the overall purpose and usefulness of the STM. More on the STM, however, may by be found in the last segment of this wave mechanics applet. This last segment also contains some interesting biographical sketches of quantum mechanics? most well known pioneers.In summary, the simulations in this wave mechanics applet do much to enhance the users intuition of some key concepts in quantum mechanics. The dual representations in both the double slit and wave packet simulations are most revealing in their presentation of probability densities, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. To make a final criticism,
 the author might have done better in providing some textual instruction; the simulations seem to have been presented in a sort of vacuum where key concepts might be missed for lack of textual underscore.",4
66,"This site does a beautiful job of visualizing otherwise difficult to conceive aspects of quantum mechanics. With their changeable conditions, the applets inspire great curiosity for the layman to inquire more in depth about the presented topics as well as clarification for the a little more advanced physics student. In either case, the applets invite the user to spend ample time with the concepts.The applets are not only very helpful and sound, but also an aesthetically pleasing supplement to any Quantum Mechanics/Modern Physics book. Minor technical flaws overal do not distract from the site's easy to use, instructing applets.Wave/Particle Duality in Quantum Mechanics	This site superbly visualizes the Young slit experiment. The posed question about the reason for the decrease in noise the when more particles have hit the screen guides the reader in the right direction to think of the experiment in a statistical manner.Propagation of a Free Wavepacket	The otherwise difficult to envision propagation and successive spreading of a wavepacket is playfully illustrated here. The only improvement suggestions I have are 1)	To enlarge the graph in which the waves are spreading. This way the waves of width 1 and 2 would more clearly show signs of spreading by the time they reach the graph's end in both the probability density as well as in the real part of the wave function.2)	To include the wavepacket's propagation in momentum space as it is so tightly related to configuration space.Propagation of a Non-Minimal Wavepacket	This illustration is an excellent follow up to the previous applet. Not all wavepackets start propagation from their minimum size. The non-minimal wavepacket first contracts in configuration space as the waves with higher frequencies at the trailing edge ""catch up"" to the bulk of the wave and then spread ahead of the rest.Steps and barriers	This applet smoothly visualized a gaussian wavepacket hitting a step potential under various conditions. The reflection,
 interference and transmission are evident and well executed. The user really benefits from the changeability of the energy of the step potential. There is one thing that demands change for the text to be physically sound: The second paragraph should read ""When the step height is less or smaller ?"" It would also be nice to see what happens when a wavepacket hits a finite barrier of step height less than its particle energy.Scanning Tunneling Microscope	This applet is a fun and thoughtful addition to the previous visualizations as it provides a bridge from theoretical to measurable physics. I suggest explaining what is meant by the ""sample."" The electric green color made me think of GAK, which the sample is not. Technical Remarks: Spelling and grammar need some attention to make the texts a non- distracting, flawless reading.  A better compromise between tex box size and applet size could also be found. When manipulating an applet would be moe helpful to be able to read the whole featured explanation text rather than merely one sentence at a time.",4
66,"The most admirable aspect of this site is that it provides a certain amount of visual elucidation and thus inspiration to the novice quantum mechanic.  It is easy to feel like quantum mechanics is a vast collection of unrelated mathematical abstractions when one first embarks on the time-honored set of introductory wave mechanics problems (the particle in a box, particle incident on a step potential, harmonic oscillator etc?).  This site illustrates every introductory wave mechanics problem I had previously encountered and several I had not.  While the lack of associated text and derivation makes this site unsuitable as a stand alone educational tool it did give many of these problems, which were heretofore vague and abstract, a more visual and concrete significance, and a sense of coherence which I found to be quite appealing.  The material presented on this site is primarily at or above my current level of competence in the field of wave mechanics and partial differential equations, but with that disclaimer, I could find no flaws in the material presented.My favorite applet was the particle incident on a step potential barrier.  If memory serves most texts put forth a similar problem to describe the transmission probability in which the particle is described by a completely delocalised wave function (Δ x = infinity).  In the applet the particle is described by a function with finite uncertainties in momentum and position.  I found that the treatment given in the applet provided a more intuitive sense of transmission of a particle through a barrier, and when time permits I would like to work through the problem for myself.  I also enjoyed the applet depicting the double potential well,
 but further rumination is needed before I can make any reasonably intelligent commentary on it.In summation I would say that this site is the first to have truly convinced me that Java can play an important role in the teaching of physics, and I intend to return to it to further my own understanding of the subject.  My congratulations are extended to its authors.Technical Remarks: The site is technically well constructed.  The Java applets are masterfully done: plots are clearly labeled and easy to read, all functions are straightforward and easy to use, and the presentation is professional and aesthetically appealing.  The only drawbacks I could identify were a handful of typographical errors and the daunting size of the Java applets.  The average applet size appeared to be in the neighborhood of 150k, which produced a 10 to 30 second delay on the university computers.  I shudder to think how long they would have taken me to load through the 28.8 modem on my home computer",5
66,"This review of Quantum Physics Online (English Version) covers only the section on wave mechanics.  I am a junior undergraduate physics major who has completed a course in modern physics, and I have also been exposed to material generally covered in the first few chapters of an undergraduate quantum mechanics text.  My response to this site is extremely positive.  The animations concerning both the wave-packet propagation and the steps and barriers clearly illustrate concepts that I had not yet been able to clearly visualize.  When I take a quantum mechanics course in the fall and will be more actively studying the mathematics of the subject, I intend on returning to this site for a better-informed pass at the wave mechanics applets, as well as the additional material of the site.  Comments concerning the specific material reviewed follow:Wave-particle duality in a Young slit experiment:    I found the animation an excellent representation of the particle-wave slit experiment and was reminded of Feynman scratching out probability curves on his blackboard.  I cranked up the rate of the ?lumps? being fired and watched as the curves on the histogram smoothed out to the nearly continuous distributions expected.  Simple and very nice.Propagation of a wave packet:  Having scratched my head more than once trying to visualize a ?wave-packet propagating through space?, this applet and some re-reading of textbook material helped me to make some headway on this subject, at least two-dimensionally.  I liked that one could specify to watch either the absolute square of the wave function or the real part of the wave function.  That the parts of the wave-packet with the greater momentum will propagate faster causing spreading of the wave-packet makes sense when you can watch it happen.  I like the option of varying the width (from .5,
1,2) of the wave-packet, assuming that the numbers .5,1,2 correspond to relative widths.  This variable ?width? isnice to show that the more localized the packet is initially, the quicker it spreads out in space due to the correlation of increased localization and increased uncertainty in momentum.  That the parts of the packet with larger momentums would propagate with larger velocities is nicely seen, though I would prefer to see the animation progress a bit longer than it does.  Quibbles.Propagation of non-minimal wave-packets:  Just a variation on the previous, excellent wave-packet applet.  The wave-packet localizes and then spreads due, as I have read, to the different initial configuration of momenta in the packet.  I have also read that outside measurements will collapse a wave-packet, only for the wave-packet to then spread out or ?grow? with time, collapsing again at each additional measurement.  How exactly is this phenomenon related to the non-minimal wave-packet portrayed in this applet?Steps and Barriers:  This is the section for which I have the least exposure and understanding.  Again, the animation of quantum tunneling appears to be a wonderful treatment of the subject, but since I am not versed in the mathematics of the phenomenon, in my eyes it still smacks of witchcraft, something I hope that will pass with further exposure.  Varying the step size to watch the relative amount of the wave reflected and transmitted is a very instructive exercise, and I look to revisit this applet in the near future when I am better armed.Scanning tunneling microscope:  Our excellent electronics instructor here at Humboldt State has spoke on this topic a few times,
 and this applet reflects exactly what I have already learned on the subject (on a relatively qualitative level).  The applet provides a nice, fairly qualitative look at the subject, and the interactive part is instructive--calling it a game might be a bit of a stretch. Technical Remarks: I applaud the design and operation of the applets.  While they were fairly sizable, the load time on my 56K modem was only about ten seconds?well worth the brief wait.  There were a few typos noticed, and the brief encroachment of French on the English site (e.g. barriere).  The author has obviously paid great attention to detail throughout, both in the programming and in the physics.  I offer only my compliments.",5
66,"These are excellent tools to visualize the basic postulates of Quantum Mechanics.   The physical observables demonstrated in the applets are well chosen and allow for rapid serial imprinting of the basics of the theory. I believe that student brain time devoted to insufficient mental models of QM is better served by something like these applets which allow the mind to jump an abstraction layer conceptually.  This is a good, non-mathematical starting point for QM.Technical Remarks: All the remarks that went with the applets were well written and did teach me new some new physics I had not known about.  The only thing I could think to improve would be to specify in the wave packet applet whether or not the wave packet is the minimum uncertainty (Gaussian).",5
66,"More vital than a book full of equations and physical laws, is the imagination of the physicist.  For it is our imagination and physical intuition that lead us to new discoveries.  Web pages such as this one help students see, and therefore be able to better imagine the world of quantum mechanics.  	The beauty of java applets is their ability to show experiments that are difficult, or even impossible to reproduce in the class room.  For example, the applet displaying the spreading of the wave packet shows students something they could never see in real life by showing not only the way the packet spreads over time, but the real AND IMAGINARY components of the wave.  Illustrations such as these simultaneously help the student understand the situations quantum mechanics deal with, and hopefully spark their imagination as well.  	The customizable nature of the applets transforms the simulations into virtual experiments, allowing the students to put their new knowledge to work.  They can gain a wonderfull intuition about the various systems by playing with the different variables.  	With all this in mind, it is important to remember that the applets alone cannot do the full job of teaching quantum mechanics.  No matter how interactive they are, they are still limited to the boundaries of their program.  As a result they can never answer all the questions and address all the concerns of prospective students.  They must retain their position in life as a teaching tool, not a teacher.Technical Remarks: The provided text boxes are very small, making it impossible to read the entire text and view the applet at the same time.  Given the wonderfull job the programmers did putting together these applets,
 this is definately negligable, yet an annoying feature of this site.  On the other hand I must comment that the translation from French to English was done quite well, with the exception of a few typos",4
66,A collection of applets covering many topics in modern physics. Almost all of them were very good.,4
67,"Great tutorial. Gives the basics to get started quickly with Camtasia and be successful. I do wish some links would open in a new window and not take you away from the tutorial page, but that's a minor request.",5
67,"This is an Articulate presentation on using Camtasia studio. Plusses are that the Articulate interface is great (viewing a table of contents, notes, attachments, navigating using the outline), the audio is good, and the pacing/timing of the presentation is appropriate. 
The tutorial was long - 92 screens and 29 minutes, 14 seconds. Dividing it into multiple briefer sections may have been a more useful strategy, even though the Articulate interface lets the user navigate to various sections quickly. There was a lack of consistency in the navigation - sometimes I had to click to advance screens while other times the screens advanced automatically. While it covers Camtasia 3 (and at this writing we're up to Camtasia 5), much/most of the content is still highly relevant and useful.Technical Remarks:The Articulate interface is useful for such a long tutorial and provides users with the opportunity to navigate at will in the material.",4

You have a bunch of reliable information right at your finger tips. This is extremely effective for anyone, either for review or first time learning. It is easily understood and you can keep coming back to it again and again if you need more repetition. This gives the student just one more outlet to use and go to whenever they need help or even a refresher.",4
69,"I clicked through the links, read through explanations, and generally browsed the site. Content is good, very relevant, and highly useful, but could be presented better. The fact that it has a Java aspect is useful, yet not the easiest for some users as Java can cause a few problems with slower connections, or for those who are using public computers. However, explanations of the theories are well-presented and easy to understand, with plenty of information on each topic and diagrams for every concept. Students would probably find this page more useful than teachers, as the layout is simple and there are spaces for one to try out various examples. However, teachers could use these as examples in teaching, and the multiple graphs/images are useful when trying to explain concepts. This would be easy to use for an average user, as the layout is just links which lead to html content with images that explain the concepts. While not the most aesthetically pleasing site, it does provide good information, easy to use applets, and a simple layout that is useful when trying to navigate to specific topics.Technical Remarks:Java applets are tricky, because they are useful for the content trying to be conveyed, but they can run slow and even get caught up in firewalls, which is a hindrance, especially for slower connections (i.e. public computers). The layout of the site is good in the sense that it is simple, with links to the various topics, which is easy to navigate to, especially for an average user who is not willing to do a ton of sifting through content. Layout is simple, could benefit from a few improvements, but overall does not deter from the information conveyed.",3

70,This is a very comprehensive site that can be used for specific topics in Canadian history.  Students can use their inquiry and critical thinking skills with this site.  Teacher guidance and instruction as to the use of the site would be critical for ease of navigation for some areas.Technical Remarks:There seems to be two site designs inside one.  The teacher notes section for the Gold Rush section has a dead link. It is a little confusing as to how it switches from one site design to another.,4
70,"This is a good place to send students to build an appreciation of the difficulties associated with understanding the past based on the limitations of history.  The site reinforces the messages that all historical data is skewed by culture, and limited by incomplete or inaccurate recording.

77,"Useful repository of video resources, generally catalogued into possible topic categories.  Resource synopses provide an accurate summary of the resource, and frequently identify key discussion points and possible learning activities.Technical Remarks:.- Some video clips are not available as on-line resources..- Not all clips are tagged with warnings about possibly offensive language (preview is advisable).-. Public performance implications for each resource will need to be determined by instructor before determining best route to introduce students to the material.",5
77,This is an outstanding collection of sociological cinema teaching sociology through video. I have used some of the videos in my online courses. There are numerous resources including a link where you can submit a video.Technical Remarks:Some of the videos show no online access.,5
78,"Although I have been working to make my courses and syllabi accessible for quite some time, I still found this website helpful. The specific examples (under ""rhetoric"") were particularly useful. Worth a read for all faculty. ",5
78,Thanks for sharing this. ,5
79,"This website provides excellent practice exercises for interpreting both NMR and IR spectra. Many of my students express the desire for more practice problems in these areas and this website is certainly one that will provide many problems for both types of spectroscopy. Splittling the problems into differing levels of difficulty makes the problems far more approachable than if they were mixed together. Providing overviews of both types of spectroscopy and tables of familiar peaks makes the website all the more valuable.Technical Remarks:The zoom feature is wonderful to see splitting in the H1-NMR spectra, though, as other commentators have noted, its usefulness in IR spectroscopy leaves a bit to be desired.",5
79,"While I have not used this resource in class, it takes a type of project that I do with my students and puts it in a readily available web resource. I like the use of COSY and DEPT spectra as this is an area where students do not generally have ready access to these type of spectra. The number of total problems is impressive, and the ranking by easy of solving is very handy. If students are understanding a subset of the beginner problems, they can easily find more challenging ones.Technical Remarks:I agree with the peer reviewer comment that the IR spectra should not have a zoom to a particular peak feature. Since chemists look at ranges of peaks before settling in on a particular peak, an improvement might be to have the students zoom in on the range of 1500-1900 cm-1 to guide them toward looking at carbonyls and alkene double bonds without giving the exact value.",5
80,"The materials were well written, organized logically, and accurate. The organization made moving through each screen logical. The quiz was also set up very nicely. One question appeared on each page which made navigation logical and direct. Upon completion of the quiz, the correct and incorrect answers were listed and each question included a link to related materials. I would suggest offering short quizzes after each section instead of just one quiz at the end of the tutorial. It would be beneficial to allow students to quiz themselves throughout the lesson, so they can develop and maintain an understanding of their progress.",4
80,"this tutorial should be used by all lower division college courses.  The only suggestion would be to make this a video with ""live"" instruction.",4
80,Excellent videos. Will definitely provide this resource to my MS Word students. ,5
81,"Wonderful database, I'm going to use it intensively during my class lectures",5
81,"My adult school classroom has recently benefited from this site. It is very in-depth and other than the occasional getting lost in it, my students find themselves submersed in information.Technical Remarks:Very deep site.",5
81,"I have used this site as a resource for the Soviet Union topic in Social Studies.  It has a good representation of video, audio, text and images which is a good learning tool and resource for teachers and students.  The timeline is easy to choose a period in Russian history to study.Technical Remarks:The videos can take some time to download, depending on the processing and internet speed.",4
82,"While I have not had the opportunity to use this yet, it will certainly be accessed during the upcoming school year. Thank you for providing such a wealth of resources for poetry. Your quality of content, potential effectiveness as a teaching/learning tool, and ease of use will make this a valued resource.",5
82,"This will be a great resource for my class. The resources regarding poems to teach or events to hold while teaching about poetry are creative and engaging. This site can be helpful to teachers and/or students in urban, rural, or suburban areas.Technical Remarks:The site was easy to navigate. There were no bells or whistles but it is user friendly.",4
82,"The learning materials are absolutely wonderful. I wish I had known about these materials when I was teaching American Literature  at the secondary level. It would have certainly engaged my students in studying poetry. I would recommend that any teacher who teaches American poetry utilize these sources. Excellent!!!Technical Remarks:As I clicked on each link, I found no problems whatsoever. There is nothing more disappointing when links do not work. For each link title, there is substantial information that will make learning for both the teacher and students. In addition, these links provide many opportunities for various teaching strategies.",5
82,"For years I have used Poets.org as supplemental material when teaching literature courses. The site has improved a great deal. The information about the poets is interesting and valuable, but it is not an ideal location for conducting research and locating secondary sources. The essays and interviews are helpful, but if a student is doing literary research, then the library databases are more suitable for getting a compiled list of literary criticiques on a poetry era, a poem or a poet. Instead, this site is a general gateway for learning about some poets. The video and audio components are VERY useful learning tools. What I dislike is that historical poets, and some spoken-word poets or great reknown,  have been overlooked and are not in the directory. Such poets, like Saul Williams or the late Sekou Sundiata, should be included. Also, the historical verses of the Therigatha - the first Buddhist nuns - is an absolute must; Sappho is included, after all. Lastly, the earliest known poet, who happens to be a woman - Enheduanna - is an absolute MUST for any poetry collection.Technical Remarks:The site is very cluttered, but the structure facilitates its use. The videos and audio play without difficulty.",4
82,"I reviewed this poetry collection extensively and created a three day lesson that incorporates the use of this learning tool in an 8th grade English classroom. This quality of this content is remarkable. Authentic recordings of classic poems read by their original authors is an extremely valuable tool for teaching poetry. If used appropriately, this source can help learners gain insight into the mood and voice of a poet. This source significantly enhances a teacher's ability to teach poetry, and poetry reading, to a group of learners. This source was extremely easy to use.Technical Remarks: Very easy to navigate. Audio files loaded quickly. ",5
83,A very well done site for learning about history. ,5
84,"Great free educational materials, and it is easy to navigate. I am assuming the site is designed for students who has taken some basic training in Japanese language. I like the word list function and quiz function where students can study and take a quiz by themselves. Answer review pages are also clear and I like the easy navigation system. ",4
86,"This serves as a useful addition to the academy. While Online education is spreading, there is not enough data of the cogency and value of this mode for current and future consumers.",4
87,"If you are teaching a course on electronic devices or solid state physics you will want to look into this site.  Chu Ryang Wie writes some of the best applets on this subject, and this site contains a large number.  Highly recommended. ",5
88,"An excellent collection of Blake's illustrations, which are often difficult to find in print anthologies.",4
88,"The material on William Blake is outstanding, and I professionally feel that it will be useful for both teachers and students.Technical Remarks:Is is very easy to access the links. There were no problems whatsoever.",5
89,"This was very informative for me to learn about effective eLearning. As a student in the eLearning program, I gained insights and knowledge on being effective in this field.",5
90,The tutorial and practice set is excellent. The adjusting process typically is very difficult for students to grasp - these real life examples will give the students a great vehicle to ensure their understanding of the material. The videos are great!,5
91,"This site actually functions a little more like a course website than a new way to create PPT files. You can easily drop in files from your drop box, files from the web, files already in Blendspace, YouTube, Google Drive. You can even upload media files you create into the site. You can allow commonts and track the views of the lesson.  It's easily customizable with themes, colors, and layouts. Additionally, you can share or embed the lesson using a variety of formats. You can restrict the privacy of the lesson and even add Co-Authors to the lesson.
The site offers lots of pre-built lessons so you can see how others are using them in their teaching/learning environments. 
Overall very good resource and I am excited to build a lesson for my fall class! ",5
91,This site is a new way to do presentations--more powerful than PowerPoint and certainly easily accessible.  It is great from both student and instructor perspectives.,5
92,"If I had known this simulation before, it would have been more practical to learn when I studied.",5
92,"An excellent simulation of gas particle motion.  Needs to be shown to students with guidance to use. Can discover relationships of variables.Technical Remarks: Beware- students can defy the law of conservation of matter if they manipulate moles (n) and temperature since PV=nRT, the math allows it!",5
92,Explains Gas Law nicely.,5
92,"Excellent simulation for Gas Laws.  Shows how the individual speed of molecules vary, but average does not.",5
92,Great simulation of the ideal gas law that can clearly show the relationships between different variables. Would want to use with some sort of assignment or guided learning at first and then allow students to do self guided learning.,4
92,Useful visualization tool when discussing ideal gases but the realtionship feature did not always work.,4
92,Great simulation; its easy enough to understand that it can be used for all grade levels and science courses.,5
92,"The application is quite good.  I found navigating through the graphs and situation responses a little unclear and clunky.  Having the instructions pop up immediately upon entering the site would make the experience better instead of them being in a link.Technical Remarks:I liked the flexibility/variables offered by the site.  The way it is constructed without much explanation would require that it be used as a demonstration device in the classroom, and not left to the student as a tutorial, without sufficient background understanding.",4
92,"I only spent like 3 minutes on this page because it contained little information about the simulation, just the visual simulation itself.  I think the simulation is a great idea, but I think because of the lack of content it was hard tounderstand the simulation itself. I wish there was a Key that showed what each label represented.  Also I think if there was an introduction about what this simulation would show, why it is the way it is, and any background information would make it great.  I think with that in mind, this simualtion would be a great visual aid in helping students understand about the material gas.Technical Remarks:I was instantly turned off by the lack of information with this simulation",2
92,"1. & 4.  I tried all the buttons and levers, and it works great!  Any student with a fundamental knowledge of kinetic theory will be able to use this application.2. Very high quality.  Variables are easy to change, and the visual is terrific.  I like the tracking device.3. The next time I present gases I will use this, and I will link it to my class homepage for the students to play with.  It will definitely enhance the concepts for them.Technical Remarks: It works great with Internet Explorer, but very poorly or not at all in my Mac version of Netscape v4.72.  The JAVA must not be compatible because I get error messages as the applet is loaded.",5
92,"A very good and well done simulation of the Ideal Gas Law.  All of the buttons and sliders work.  The interaction between the molecules and the walls as well as with each other was very well done, with molecules changing direction with even the slightest contact between one another.  This simulation would enhance the efectivenss of the teachers ability to teach and the students ability to learn.  Technical Remarks: It is definately easy to use and almost anyone could start it up and within five minutes know how to use the program.  ",5
92,I have played with this simulation for 3 hours over the course of a week. I will definitely use this in my classroom to introduce gas law variables and kinetic energy. This simulation is easy to use but the students will need guidance in establishing the relationships between the variables. The attached worksheet helps the student focus on establishing the relationships between variables. Excellent simulation.Technical Remarks: The worksheet has the greatest impact when used with Excel. The students can see the straight line relationships and can use the equation for the line immediately to answer questions in the worksheet. The help menu was a bit hidden for me. But I found it eventually.,5
92,"Interesting desmotration, thank you for share, i hope to get more materials equals quallity",5
93,This wiki links to subject-specific information literacy resources that are identified by academic librarians. These materials are most helpful for student majors.,5
94,"How you reviewed the materialsI used several applets to verify several case studies worked during my introductory thermodynamics class.  This only took a matter of minutes, instead of the several hours that it took to perform the complex calculations involved in the case study.Quality of contentThe site is very strait forward and the information given is very well organized and easy to follow.  The site is defiantly useful for a student using thermodynamics at any level.  Potential effectiveness for enhanced teaching and learning This site is very effective for either a beginning student or a seasoned teacher.  The applets as well as the accompanying text are all strait forward and easy to navigate.  The site has definite potential for classroom use.Ease of usingThe site was very easy to use.  The applets were all strait forward and contained in a logical outline that made them easy to find and navigate.",5
95,I have used this applet for many semesters but recently have had to give it up because of Java issues. WISE is working on revision of their applets to improve the ease of use but this one isn't there yet. I keep checking though because it is a great visualization of the changes in the sampling distribution resulting from changes in sample size. The worksheet provided with the applet makes it possible to assign as homework with computer-literate students.,4
96,Excellent information.  Smoothe transitions via site.  Loved this! A wealth of information to use immediately.,5
96,Has some good tips.,3
96,This is an awesome blog. I have never seen so much information. I am impressed that so much information has been put here. Accurate information and links and info. I have bookmarked it and will be visiting it again!Technical Remarks:I was particularly impressed with the infomation about google plus. I did not know that google has so many applications.,5
96,"This is the blog to follow if you're interested in using iPads in your classroom.  Jennie Magiera is an excellent in-person presenter, but you can find many, many resources in the blog that will help you to integrate technology effectively in your classroom.",5
97,"Appears to be a nice program, but the graphics are a bit dated and may be difficult for high school students to keep their interest.  Probably better for college students.",3
97,"I worked through this applet and performed a couple of the suggested experiments. I found the pendulum w/ rotating suspension force very interesting. The experiment stated that while balancing a pencil on the tip of your finger is very difficult, balancing a pendulum in the upright position is very easy. I found this to be very interesting and I tried the experiment myself using the given applets. Technical Remarks: The applets are very easy to use and the instructions are very helpful. The lecture room provides an information base for those unclear on the theories involved. Nice Site.",5
97,"The applet was very easy to understand how to use.  I found it very helpful in learning basic ideas.  Some additions could be made such as demonstrating relationships with other kinds of motion, but it did help in understanding the fundamentals.  It was very good overall.",5
97,"Five good online demonstrations, complete with stopwatches and oscilloscopes that function like the real thing.  This utility works well for demonstrating many different types of periodic motion, and can be used as a laboratory (although they are merely simulations, not the real thing).  Very well done and very helpful.",5
98,"How you reviewed the materials:I spent most of my time working with the rankine cycle calculator. I was primarily interested in the simulation aspect of the module. I probably played around with it for close to an hour.The quality of content:The application was very nice and helpful. It did a good job of relating the concepts and properties of the rankine cycle through the T-s graph.The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning:The application could be easily integrated into a classroom setting. It can be used to show the many variances of the cycle, and how to manipulate them via pressure or temperature changes within the system.The ease of using the materials:It was pretty easy to use as long as you understood the simple relations, so that you weren't trying to alter the extraction pressure to something that was higher than the boiler pressure.",5
98,How you reviewed the materials     I was first introduced to this applet in the classroom.  The applet was introduced to the class to demonstrate the difference between a Carnot Cycle and a regular Rankine Cycle.  I later came back and used the different applications over the period of 20 minutes or so to thoroughly test the different applets abilities.Quality of content     The web site has lots of different applets that view the way a steam plant works with varying complexity.  My major complaint is that to view the more complex processes you have to first view the less complex process and one by one make your way up the complexity level.  There is no quick link for the various cycles.  The cycle must be taken in progression.   The two diagrams side by side are very helpful.  This helps the student visualize where the steam is in the plant as well as what process is taking place in relation to the dome.Potential effectiveness for enhanced teaching and learning      As this was introduced in the classroom I found it to be very effective.  It effectively demonstrated the use of several heat cycles.  It allowed the more visual learners to comprehend what process are taking place.  This is a very helpful tool and I highly recommend that all instructors utilize this site when explaining or introducing engine cycles and efficiency.Ease of using     The site is very easy to use and pretty strait forward.  As I mentioned earlier it is kind of difficult to navigate the site because of the progression needed to access the higher complexity cycles.  The diagrams are very easy to use easy to comprehend.,5
99,"Faculty and students will benefit from lecture notes, diagrams, and pictures in this site.  These learning materials are very effective in teaching plant biology.  The best part of this site includes lots of plant taxonomy, complete with much-needed links to high-quality pictures and diagrams.",5
100,"Strengths:Very nice presentation.
 
Concerns:Although, there is a chronology in the teacher’s area, there is none for the student researcher.
Organization of the site. The sections are labeled in alphabetical order, but it might be more effective to order them slightly differently",4
101,ABG are an essential resoource for clinical diagnosis and often lead the charge for a suitable working diagnosis. Understanding ABG's is a critical element.,4
101,I enjoyed this material because after you read the information you can test your knowledge on the 10 case study questions. This material was very informatively and concisely written!,5
101,"I used this activity in a nurse residency program as a review of arterial blood gasses.  I incorporated the tutorial as a part of a ""Jeopardy"" style game in which resident groups competed against one another to complete the quiz questions.  The residents really enjoyed the activity.  A few ICU nurses even commented that they used the tutorial after hearing about it from the nurse residents.  Since then, the tutorial has been integrated into the ICU nurse orientation.  Great activity! ",5
101,"Quality of content: content is very accurate. The ABG Online Learning Activity used appropriate language and examples to explain arterial blood gases. Understanding ABG's can be difficult for many nursing students, this activity makes a difficult topic more easily understood. This activity can reinforce and review in class content but should not be used as a sole teaching device. This activity is appropriate for the junior/senior level nursing student. 
The activity is set up on individual slides similar to a Power Point presentation. The slides are easy to read and ""click"" through. Basic ABG information is presented in the first half of the activity with case studies presented in the last half. The case studies are useful as in class review material. The instructor can pull up the case studies, allow the students time to read the study, and then ask the students the associated quiz questions. 
This activity is well-designed to use in the all online classroom as well. This activity will be easy to use by all instructors/students who are familiar with ""Power Point"" formats. ",4
101,"This is great!  Excellent case studies, simple explanations for a subject that can be so difficult for nursing students.  Thank you!",5
101,"The author provides good step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow. Also, provides many case studies to apply and practice the information provided. ",4
101,"I highly recommend this tutorial for nursing students. It gave me a chance to practice what I've learned, and to pick up some new information. Thank you.",4
101,"A good basic site for someone who wants to test her/his understanding of ABG's. The content is dry to read, but the case studies offer an excellent opportunity to test oneself with instant feedback.Technical Remarks:I felt it could have been more interactive for the 'learning' part. The case studies are nicely interactive, but the content is basically presented in a read only fashion.",4
101,Excellent tutorial on blood gas interpretations.  Would be useful as a review for yearly competencies also.,4
101,"I spent about 1 hour completing this tutorial.  I found it to be extremely helpful.  Arterial blood gas interpretation can be a little tricky and I have always had to think about these situations for a while to understand them.  This tutorial provided a step by step guide to interpreting arterial blood gases.  I am really impressed.  I feel much more proficient after doing all of the case studies.  The content is of very high quality.  The concepts are represented accurately and completely.  This is an excellent guide for a nursing student trying to understand and apply these concepts.  This tutorial is an effective, interactive and fun learning tool.",5
102,"This is a very good site for those who learn visually. The animations were simple, but still made the material very clear and easy to understand.",5
102,"This is a great resource and tutorial that I have used when reviewing cellular A&P with nursing students. This is not an area that we have much time to spend on, so students are instructed to use the tutorial to familiarize themselves with the structure and function of the plasma membrane.",4
102,This is a wonderful object. Thank you. Will use very soon in classroom.,5
102,It is a great site. I could include this tool in the lecture of cell membrane. The slices for introduction before the questions are kind wordy and long. But I like the assessment questions at the end. It helps students to recall the information introduced in the beginning. The visuals and animation with the game definitely help students to have a picture of cell membrane in their mind.,5
102,"nice interactive, a little wordy I might have to require students to take notes to ensure they are reading.",4
102,Good  visuals and animation...great tool for the cellular membrane and its components.,5
102,This is a very useful learning tool that is far better than any text book in communciating concepts. I would like to work with Dr. Liang to add the most important element which is the Na-K-ATPase pump which would allow the resource to move to the cellular level permitting students to understand ion transport and gradients. I found it very easy to use and think that students can learn this material on their own more efficiently than reading or listening to a lecture. ,4
102,"Very Good, Lower levelTechnical Remarks: I believe that function of what cholesterol does is right but the depiction of how cholesterol does it is not right. First, it lines up along the surface. Second it keeps lipid tails straight preventing defect formation that allows water soluble materials to pass through these transient defect pores.",4
102,"This site is great.  I think any student who interacts with this page will come away knowing more about cell membranes.  I thought the images/pictures were great.  I also really liked building the cell membrane and throught the questions were good.  The site was easy to navigate, and the content was super.  I spent about 15 minutes browsing the site, but when I made up a worksheet to go with it, I stayed on for about an additional 20 minutes.",5
102,"I found this website very interesting, easy to use and helpful with learning the cell membrane.  I enjoyed going through it myself very much.",5
103,This site was very helpful and easy to work.,4
103,"As a faculty who teaches online and conducts research on online teaching and learning, I find this material quite useful. It clearly laids out all the instructional design principles for effective online teaching and provides explanations for each. 
1) Quality of Content: excellent (comprehensive).
2) Potential Effectiveness as a learning Tool: great potential
3) Ease of Use: The interface is clear and the site is easy to navigate.
However, this material was created in 2006 and online teaching has deveoped a lot since then. I would suggest updating the principles and also adding principles in some areas, for example: How to use social media in teaching; how to engage students in teaching by applying social and emotive principles.",4
103,"This website is expedient for providing effecient and effective  resources for both novice and expereinced online teachers. Also,the  performance indicators are applicable for both K-12 and Higher Ed Instutions.",5
103,"A great website that gives examples and guides the novice or emerging faculty through the steps to developing an online course in terms of instructional design to interactions. One thing that would make the site better is if the font were larger, which would make it easier to read.Although the research cited is more than 10 years old, the facts of that research still hold true, so do not be turned off by the copyright date of 2006. There are best practices and examples for all of the principles. There is definitely enough here to get faculty up and going while considering all of the important aspects of a good online course. ",5
103,This information is concise and up-to-date. An instructor can use this easily to set up an online class step-by-step and will have the information students need to get started. Excellent suggestions and tips. I will use this in my online class design.,5
103,"This material is excellent. It's layout is minimistically clear and clean, navigation is simple and instructions are easy to follow. Ideal for a first-time designer.Technical Remarks:The site is an example of the layout and ease of management that it promotes in material design. All imbeded links with further examples work well and are what they claim to be - an example of how to go about a task or solve a problem.",5
103,A useful website for faculty members who are interested in learning about teaching and designing for online.Technical Remarks:Well-design and easy to follow. Will be particularly helpful for novice online and/or hybrid faculty members.,4
103,Good introduction model to those considering online delivery of course content. Useful tips for 7-12 teachers considering online content delivery as well as for those attending intructional design courses.Technical Remarks:User friendly and does not require advanced skills or applications.,4
103,This site provides valuable resources for newcomers to online teaching as well as for faculty members who are looking for new ideas and strategies to improve the quality of their distance classes.,4
103,"Overall, this site provides solid information for an instructor either designing or teaching an online course for the first time. While some of the information was FGCU specific, the general principles can be used in most situations. Also, a few more visuals and/or audio examples would help to highlight key areas, such as working with media.",4
103,"This is a wonderful resource. The information shared can benefit both those new to online teaching and course development, as well as faculty members who are familiar with asynchronous and synchronous styles of distance learning. 

Many of the links were specific to FCGU but the many ideas and support services can be modified to assist anyone trying to better their facilitation of online instruction.",4
103,"This is a very useable checklist. I would want to compare it to the Quality Matters and Badrul Khan Checklists. 

As always, I'm interested in whether there are rubrics to help define the more subjective words like ""effective.""",5
103,"Background: I've been using this Web site for about two years.  I've used the site primarily to further my understanding of the issues involved in developing/teaching/managing online courses.  I've also used the site to assist in developing guidelines for good practice at our own college.  In addition, I've used the site as a resource when leading workshops for faculty wishing to develop and teach and online course.Quality of Content: I've been returning to this site because I believe the content to be one of the best that is currently available on the Web.  The breadth is sufficient for those new to online instruction as well as those who have considerable background, but is yet concise enough to be read in a short amount of time. Examples and a bibliography help to expand the learning where desired.Potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning: If the issues that are addressed in this document are implemented properly the faculty's teaching will most definitely be enhanced. There are issues that are somewhat judgemental and may not apply in every case, but this should be apparent to the course developer using sound reasoning.Technical Remarks: Ease of use of materials: It is my feeling that the design of this Web collection is very simple and straightforward, resulting in ease of use to newcomers.  There is one exception, and that is it is not easy to return to the original page once inside the sub-pages.",4
103,"I found this web site to be a very useful tool for either a course I am teaching on the design of distance education or for faculty development workshops on designing distance education.  Additionally, I would refer faculty to this website who wanted to augment their face-to-face courses with online materials.Technical Remarks: Parts of the website are particular to FGCU, and users directed to this site would need to warned of this in advance and guided to the particular sites of interest.  The introduction, for example is heavily geared toward FGCU, but has an excellent definition of online instruction.  The support and services section is also specific toward FGCU, but provides an example of what can and should be available for online instruction.  The site outline is quite helpful as a quick, hyperlinked tool to find correct portions of the website, and again, provides an excellent model of online design.The web site is text heavy and could prove problematic for non-native English speakers, or individuals with reading disabilities.Also, while design principles are explained well, it would be helpful to the reader/user to have familiarity with overall design principles before visiting this site.The site does heavily and effectively use examples.  Instructors who use this site might want to complement the good examples with some non-examples.",4
104,"This is a well researched resource though it would be helpful to have pertinent information on the page with the results; however, using it requires extensive preparation to fully understand.Technical Remarks:Good but lacks visulal stimulation.",4
104,This is an excellent reference for both students and teachers. The results can help professors better meet the needs of their students and students better adapt to various teaching styles.  I would like to see how the four dimensions interact with one another within individuals.Technical Remarks:The site is simple to use and offers a lot of information. I was able to take the assessment in just a few minutes.,4
104,"I found the site to be easy to utilize and the questions and subsequent results prompted quite a bit of discussion. Some of the prescribed results I may have wanted to have more detail provided, but as a starting point in the learning style assessment process, it suited its purpose.",4
104,These materials will help students understand their learning styles so they can participate in ativities that maximize comprehension.,4
104,"Learning styles is an important concept that educators often need to undestand to be successful in the classroom. However,44 questions is a little long (the questionnaire described on this page).",4
104,This is a good tool to make your own learning profile. It could be used to create learning preferences/ styles of students on day 1 of a training session or as a ice breaker also with double advantage.Technical Remarks:The display of scale is bit non-readable. The learning preferences have been abbreviated here. It would be good to provide full name of learning preferences on the scale.,4
104,"I teach a regular education class in which more than 2/3 of the class has an IEP or 504 plan.  Besides teaching the curriculum of biology, I am trying to help each student improve on their study habits and individual learning strengths.  I used this online quiz on the first day of class and after all of them had printed their results we talked about what the individual results meant.  Many of their results indicated activities or experiences were their desired learning styles.  The results didn't surprise me, but it gave me an opportunity to show the students that they were individuals who had different needs and that we would try to address those needs.  I collected the results, made individual comments in regards to their strengths and then made copies of the results before I handed the originals back to them.",4
104,"I have used the assessment in faculty development programs as a way of stimulating discussion about learning styles and the various learning style theories that are available.  It helps emphasize the point that there is still much to learn about learners!Technical Remarks:Very easy to use, well laid out.",4
104,An interesting take on learning styles. I found the information very useful.,4
104,I spent some time taking this quiz myself. I think that I'll have my 34 sixth graders and my 46 adult school ESL students take the quiz. I think it is a good idea as we try to focus our students and try to show them the way that we all reach the objectives of any lesson.Technical Remarks: This should be easy to use. I will report back if this is not the case. I have learned that both sets of my students are eager to complete a tech integrated lesson.,4
104,I have used this instrument for over 3000 students in introductory statistics courses.  We found the resulting information very useful.  It is very informative for instructors to see a summary of the types of learners in their courses. For instance after finding that the majority of my students were visual learners I added many more visual representations of topics to my class.,5
104,I found the results accurate when I took the test myself.  Many of my students are unaware of their learning style and I am planning to implement the topic into the beginning of my course as a way to help students understand how they learn.Technical Remarks: The test was easy to take and the information provided to explain one's learning style was good.,5
104,"I found the results fairly accurate when completing the survey on myself.  However, I found the graphic measures of the concepts somewhat primitive.  Also, I would like to see a description of each type rather than having to click on another page and go back and forth.",4
105,"The information is accurate and up-to-date; however, the only visual provided is a picture of a torso that the student can apply leads to. All the information is through audio. Visual learners will struggle with the presentation of the material. Unless the instructor/student has access to audio, this activity cannot be used.
Students need prior knowledge of the electrical conduction system of the heart.",3
105,"Intuitive and interactive tutorial, the lesson was easy to follow. The presentation is precise and well organized, regarding the placement of the 12 Lead ECG.  Audio and visual interactive material assists in complete comprehension of lead placement. A comparison of the 12-lead ECG placement and 5-lead ECG placement was presented, as it is an essential skill needed in the healthcare field. Very effective teaching tool if the participant already has a basic knowledge of human anatomy. Targeted specifically to individuals working in the healthcare field. Technical Remarks:It would be great if a method to pause or replay areas was provided for participants. ",5
105,Voice of narrator is very monotone. Would suggest some interaction capability while narrator is speaking (show what the narrator is referring).Technical Remarks:More should be done with technology available to promote interactivity. There is just one graphic that remains stagnant throughout the lesson.  ,2
105,Very well done. A nice addition to my medical assistant class. Well received by students.,4
105,Interesting. I appreciate the slow speed.,3
105,"It would be nice if the user could start, stop, rewind, fast forward the audio.  Content is accurate and presented very well, but the navigational elements of the tool are lacking.",3
105,"Information is valuable and correct. The audio and the correct placement activity for a 12 lead ecg recording is entertaining.
The activity has little to do with the actual 12 lead  QRS configurations described in the audio and the ability to visualize the normal 12 lead ecg morphology.",2
105,This has helped me keep my memory and skills up to date,4
106,"This reference would be very useful on the whole for a Constitutional Law course at the undergraduate level. Parts of the course would also be great additions for an Introduction to Criminal Justice, and Policing or Police Ethics. Not only is there historcial information, but there is also systems information and court decisions to review, and there are links to interactive exercises and other helpful guides.",4
106,"I took an introductory course on higher education law earlier this year, and was interested in reviewing material directed at students’ speech rights. As a higher education administration student, I found this website’s use of plain language helpful in developing a practical knowledge of the material. In gaining a working understanding of what constitutes students’ speech rights, I found it easier to identify the nuances that each landmark case brought to bear on the issue, which helped deepen my understanding. To that end, the website’s questions also provided a rigorous examination of the freedoms and limitations associated with student speech rights.Technical Remarks:I appreciate the use of photos related to the landmark cases, as the photos seem to enhance the website’s overall appearance and provide additional context for the reading material. I appreciate the quantity and quality links of links available throughout the website, as they provide the user with opportunities to engage in deeper study that is still pertinent to the original material. The website is comprehensible and easy to navigate.",5
106,I really enjoyed this material.  It was very comprehensive and I plan on using it as supplemental material for my Criminal Law and Court Procedures classes.,4
106,"Though it may be intended for law students, some of the exercises (""So, you want to marry a founding father."") seem to be targeted at high school students.  Still, it is a very comprehensive collection of explanations of virtually every aspect of the Constitution and how it is applied.  The plain language used makes the explanations especially useful for those sust beginning their study of the law.",4
107,I navigated the virtual lab and was quite impressed. Normally I do care for virtual labs but this site offers procedures that most students could never experience otherwise.Technical Remarks: The Bacterial ID Lab incorporates all of the processes involved in DNA sequencing from sample preparation to final analysis. It allows a student with limited lab skills and no access to expensive equipment to experience a ?state of the art? procedure. It demonstrates the tools and technology the make gene sequencing possible and removes some of the mystery accompanying so complex a process. The non-biology major will gain a better understanding of the technique and its application. The site is arranged in six stages that the student can easily navigate. The student can visit and revisit each procedure. Instructions and explanations are provided so that the student understands each step. ,4
108,(Faculty) Good overall review of many difficult topics. The self-paced capability should encourage those students who need additional time to review a subject to use this site for review.Technical Remarks:Ease of use is a plus and should encourage the use of this site for a review.,4
108,"I like the simplicity of the animations and the little quiz at the end.  I have linked it from my ""Notes on the Web"" and will also give it a go in a class lecture.Technical Remarks:Loads moderately fast on a 56K phone line.  I think my students would stick to it after they see what it has to offer.",4
108,"This site has nice, simple, attractive animation that is easy to navigate. My students love it and have spontaneously commented to me about it. I like to use it as a supplement to my regular lecture notes, and as something they can work with on their own at home to reinforce what they're learning in lab and lecture.",4
109,This material is accurate but could be more interactive to gain interest.,3
109,"This material was very concise yet informative. It showed pictures, definitions, mnemonics, and examples on how to test each nerve to help aid in learning the information. ",5
109,Great way to review and also learn the cranial nerves.  You can also hear how to pronounce the names.,4
109,"This learning activity presents an in-depth review of cranial nerves. The site promotes retention of material through the use of mnemonics, diagrams, quizzes, and audio. After using the site, students should be able to recall the names and purpose of all 12 cranial nerves. The site is appropriate for the college-aged student, unfortunately, the site uses the phrasing ""cranial nerves for kids"" which could be a barrier for the use in a college setting.
One drawback with Quiz 1, if an incorrect answer is chosen, the correct answer is not supplied.
Overall, the site is easy to navigate and intuitive. ",4
109,I liked that the information was direct and to the point.  The material is simple and easy to understand.  It is appropriate for the target audience. ,4
109,This looks like it would be very helpful for my communication disorders students. I especially like the activities for examining nerves and the links at the bottom of the page. All look very useful in helping students to master cranial nerve content. Students really enjoy hands-on activities. The photos also add to the interest level of the material.,4
109,"I really like how simple the site was, everything is neatly put into a chart with the names of the nerves and accompanying pictures.  The one thing that I would suggest is having a column for describing whether the nerve is sensory, motor, or both.  I particularly liked the ""test your cranial nerves"" section, and believe that it can be a fun interactive activity for students of any age (as I have done these tests in my nursing classes and found the activity both fun and helpful in learning and assessing the cranial nerves).Technical Remarks:I did not come across any technical problems.",4
110,"An amazing collection of photographs that could be used to not only study photography, but history as well. There are other collections of posters, maps, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. A fantastic resource for students.Technical Remarks:It is a little difficult to learn to navigate the site at first, and there are so many images to look at, it can be a bit overwhelming.",5
110,"What a treasure trove of images to be found at this site! NYPL Digital Gallery provides free and open access to over 800,000 images digitized from the The New York Public Library's vast collections. You can browse by topic or search by item or name. This site has served my undergraduate, credential, and graduate students well in assignments where they needed to know what something looked like or needed and image (following fair use guidelines) for curriculum development.Some of the images in the Digital Gallery may be subject to third party rights such as copyright and/or rights of privacy/publicity. Before using any of these images please review the Library's terms and conditions found at the bottom of the site homepage.",4
111,It's difficult sometimes to find an image that is not copyright protected.  This site allows educators to do just that.  The images are clear and worth using.  Take a look!,4
111,"As educators become more savvy about the use of digital technology, their need for access to images for digital creations grows. This site offers a solution for educator and their students. Pics4 learning offers many searchable categories of images submitted by educators for educational use. The photographers retain the rights to these photos, they have graciously allowed their use through this collection.",5
112,I love the ability to take quizzes and a final after viewing this presentation.  I also loved seeing examples of how a client will look in regards to certain symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Very well done,5
112,"I will pilot this content in my course. It looks like a very clear review and the quizzes reinforce key points. My only complaint in previewing the material is that there are a whole lot of typos in the explanations for the correct answers to the questions. It's almost as if the formatting is off-- many letters are omitted and it's a puzzle to figure out some of the sentences! This may be challenging, especially for non-native English speakers. ",4
112,"The information is complex enough to cover basics, and easy enough for non-medical types to understand. I found the Q&A tests to be helpful.",4
112,The site has several quizzes for learning assessment.Technical Remarks:Easy,4
113,"Beautiful pictures that are easily downloaded and integrated into presentations. Copyright information clearly listed. A variety of pictures for both Spanish and Russian classrooms, in a variety of topics.Technical Remarks:Clicking on the ""tags"" listed on the website does not always lead to resources on the site.",4
114,My students really like the idea that they could quiz themselvs and have an instant evaluation with a reason if they got it wrong.  It focuses on a difficult topic for many students.Technical Remarks: It was easy for students of all abilities to use without much help from the teacher.,4
115,This is a great tool to access if students actually comprehend the material. I would recommend adding clickers and actually using it as an exercise in class to make sure students comprehend predicting outcomes from punnent squares.,4
115,"I thought that the instructions were very easy to understance, especially for beginners.  However, I would have placed the tutorial first, before the question.Technical Remarks:All links are functioning",4
115,"I felt this site was very user friendly.  It was easy to navigate both forward and backward and always know where you were at.  The problem sets available on this site allowed for an answer to be chosen and any incorrect answers received a short tutorial to explain the correct answer.  The site also contained a vocabulary page and other relevant information.Technical Remarks: I spent a significant amount of time completing the problem sets and browsing the vocabulary pages.  I then created an assignment that utilizes this website.  The quality of content is excellent, and it has great potential effectiveness to enhance teaching and learning.",4
116,"This site is very engaging. It provides activities that reinforces concepts. Very useful resource for self quiz, practice and drill.",4
116,I am a New York State certified Biology teacher that is currently working on my master's.  I needed to make up a lesson plan that incorporated technology so I chose to use several sites from the Merlot site.  I found the graphs in this site to be very accurate.Technical Remarks: I though this site was a great tool for students to use to review the human body systems.  It is not always easy to look at a book and try and remember the different parts of the body systems.  This site actually lets students test and retest themselves.  The site is very easy to maneuver around and is very easy to access.  I had no trouble navigating around the site.,4
116,I love this site.  I like how easy it is for students to quiz themselves over the identification and processes of the human body.  It is a very simple and easy site to use and that makes it even better for all students.,5
116,"The best feature of the ""Medical Terminology"" section of this site is the interactive quiz feature. Students' medical terminology guesses are automatically scored.  While this site cannot eliminate the need for a great deal of memorization on the student's part, the quiz feature does allow one to study without a human partner.Technical Remarks: Extremely easy to use.",3
116,The materials reviewed are user-friendly in nature with a great deal of stimulating content.  The multiple choice tutorials/drill and practice modules are effective in teaching various human systems and processes.  ,3
117,"very thorough, more than I need for basic nursing class",4
117,"As a nursing student, I found this site very helpful.  It demonstrates basic nursing clinical skills in videos that are short, clear, and precise.Technical Remarks:I did not have any technical issues while using this site.",5
117,Very nicely done.  Videos are crystal clear and the user interface is excellent.,5
117,Shows a video of specific nursing skills so students can watch it as often as needed to perform the skill with competence.,5
117,An excellent resource for learning basic clinical skills online.Technical Remarks:The windows media player loaded much quicker than did the RealPlayer.,5
118,"Conjuguemos is a great resource for reviewing vocabulary and grammar. Vocabulary reviews are sorted by textbook and chapter and are easy for students to navigate. Grammar reviews are sorted by topic. Time limits can be set on vocab quizzes. Technical Remarks:The ""ignore accents"" button does not always work.",5
118,"This is a very useful site for Spanish students of any level to practice grammar and vocabulary. It's an engaging site since students can work at their own pace, and get a feedback on their performance. Provided that all my students have a computer at home and that the activities are connected to the textbook we use in our class I assigned it as extra practice outside the classroom.",5
118,"This site was a pretty good learning tool.  It is not my favorite, but pretty helpful.  It is fairly easy to navigate through, and is all about verbs, which I have the most trouble with.  The site isn't the prettiest, but nonetheless, it was a good site and I would recommend it to anyone needing help with their verbs.",3
118,"I pretended I was one of my students in a SPA 101 class and did the regular verbs present tense section and missed a few on purpose.  I did get kind of tired having to hit enter over and over, but I did like the immediate feedback and the hands-on, written interactivity.  This is a good drill and practice site for learning to write and spell the verb forms.  I also liked that the students can either view, send, or print their score and I liked the define, conjugate, and verb chart options for additional help.  I plan to have my students try it before their next test.Technical Remarks: The technology seems to be easy to use.",5
118,"I reviewed this site for possible use in my class (Each student has a computer). Although the concept is worthy and the grammar is correct, I found having to click the verification button after each response to be tidious.I would, however, recommend it to students to use on their own to review.",3
118,"I used the preterite tense as a teaching-learning activity several times with my class. Preterite Tense: excercises 7, 8 & 9 of the conjugation of preterite in Spanish, present a good way for sts to practice the conjugation of past tense of both regular and irregular verbs...Such exercises also give the sts the opportunity to learn and to correct their mistakes while they are doing the exercises...I think my sts really found the drills fun, challenging and a different technique to acquire the language..Since I asked them to time themselves, their comment was they prefer not be timed....My only pedagogical sugesstion is that the drills seem to be out of context, it would be great to present all the verbs either in a story or in a real context so that the sts can see the applications of preterite tense in Spanish.Technical Remarks: The Web Site is easy and clear for users.",4
118,"This site is a very practical site for Spanish language students enrolled at any level.  The drill and practice tutorial covers most verbs used in Levels I - III of secondary levels, and the four semesters of elementary and intermediate college courses.  The site allows students to maneuver easily, and the pull-down windows help students to memorize the verb meanings, and drill whatever verb tenses  a learner needs.  I especially like the positive reenforcement of ""Receive a grade of A+."" on the first page!  It is a great drill written by a truly creative and dedicated professor!",5
119,This is an excellent resource for math teachers and students. It uses visuals and simulations to make core math concepts accessible to students. Topic areas are also presented according to age groupings. Clear instructions are provided to students on how to manipulate and use the simulations. Instructions are also provided to teachers on how to guide students use of the materials.,5
119,It is an excellent site to explore with your kids to learn some basic mathematical concepts and to have fun.,5
119,I use the coin toss and scatterplot applets from this collection in my intro stats course. This is a fabulous and versatile collection of applets for use in all grade levels and all math/stat subjects.Technical Remarks:No problems.,5
120,"CHICO rubric is well-known and widely used. The rubrics are well-developed, comprehensive and highly applicable to course design and teaching. There are rubrics in each of the following areas:
Learner Support and ResourcesOnline Organization and DesignInstructional Design and DeliveryAssessment and Evaluation of Student LearningInnovative Teaching with TechnologyFaculty Use of Student Feedback
Design of the Site: I would suggest enlarge the Top Menu. I found it in my third visit to the site. During the first two visits, I was not able to find the rubrics.",5
120,"Rubric is clear and well laid out. A printable copy of the rubric is also available.
Important criteria for online course design and implementation are included.  ",5
120,This is valuable content but I am concerned because it is copyrighted material. I thought all content on MERLOT was to be OER?,4
120,"Easy to use, navigate, and understand. Just the right amount of information for an online course evaluation rubric that you can access quickly and begin using right away.",4
120,"This site provided a very comprehensive rubric for assessing the quality of an online course.  An excellent enhancement was access to a checklist of actual functions and content that complements the level of attaining the rubrics rating scale, e.g. baseline, effective, exemplary were also provided.  Each year, exemplary courses using WebCT and Blackboard are chosen based on these rubrics and poster images of the faculty selected are posted on the site as well. This information not only provides clear guidance to achieve goals but also a way to acknowledge the excellence demonstrated in implementing quality online instruction.",5
121,This really demonstrates a concept frequently described with a lot of words that don't begin to paint a picture students can understand.,5
121,"I use this site to supplement the two-dimensional diagrams of myosin/actin interactions typically shown in textbooks.  I then ask the students to answer a series of questions about what they saw.  Students find it very challenging to describe events occuring in a three-dimensional animation.  Use of this apaproach can show you who is just memorizing such steps, and who comprehends the interactions.",4
121,"This is an excelent animation. It is something that I can't duplicate in class without spending the better part of an hour. Because it is clearly labelled and keyed, student can view and study it on their own and I can review it in class.",4
121,"Used the module in my introductory biology course for non-majors. Although it had a touch too much detail for my group of students, they definitely had a light bulb going on when they saw the interaction of the different components.Areas of excellence: easy to use and loads easily.Areas of concern: noneTechnical Remarks: The applet is exceptional, it runs really well when online in the classroom, maybe not quite so well over modem. The ability to use one of two options to view it is excellent.Might be nice to be able to stop it at certain times.",5
122,"I think this would be a great review tool for students.  Two comments on the self study quizzes(1) We teach that debits are recorded first, followed by credits.  Multiple choice quiz answers include the credit portion followed by the debit. (2) Materials purchased for use in production are not debited to materials expense but to material inventory.  This concept may not have been covered yet but the inforamtion is incorrect. Technical Remarks:Easy to use.  No specifc technical skills needed.",3
122,This will be a good material for self-study.,4
123,This is a very useful website!,5
123,Great source! Thanks!,4
123,"Many useful materials, and a reasonable organizational scheme. I especially liked the ""Teach with Pictures"" section for intermediate ESL.Technical Remarks:PDF files take longer to load. Some PDFs are in landscape orientation, so on screen, you have to turn your head sideways.",5
123,I like this idea. I'm not a big fan of all of the ads.,3
123,"Great source for referenceTechnical Remarks:The quizes are great, I like the way it was desing, were we pick a answer and we get the right or wrong resoults in seconds",5
123,"I found the site very informative and broad in its content.  I liked the categorization of info to beginning, intermediate and fast.  I appreciated the categorization, i.e. jobs and study, shopping, etc.Technical Remarks:From my computer, at least, browsing was hampered by having to make several attempts to get to a certain segment.",4
123,"Guidance, recommendations, professional advice - these are some of those many good things that may be found in ESL FLOW. It's a great chance of sharing your teaching experience and getting new ideas for your for your own class. I see a big advantage of this website in giving an opportunity for the teachers to access a big variety of ESL materials.  I'm planning to work with ESL Flow. It might be a good resource in making my classes more interesting.  Thanks.  Elena Alexeyeva.",5
123,What a great resource for students and teachers of ESL/EFL alike.  I browsed ESL Flow for about an hour looking mainly in the teaching pronunciation area.  Subsequently I have gathered helpful lesson plans that I will definitely use in the future.  The content of this site was remarkable with lessons and materials that are relevant and easily understood and administered.  I will be back for more! ,5
123,"Here is the URL http://humanities.byu.edu/linguistics/lp/lps5.html that I found through http://www.eslflow.com. It is a ""speaking"" lesson plan for ""adults.""The proficiency level of this lesson plan is ""intermediate.""The ""terminal objective"" is for Students to be able to generate authentic language in meaningful situations.  The ""short objectives"" are for students to be able to ask questions for clarification, and be able to summarize and explain stories produced by other class members. The advantages of this lesson:The teaching procedure is very clear, and also includes the minutes of each item.The compose type is very clean and easy for readers to read.It is good that the description of the teaching content provides a lot of details.  For instance, instead of asking students to speak freely, the teacher perpares many pictures for students as speaking topic examples.  To pair up students not only provides everyone has the chance to speak and but also summarize  and explain their partners' stories.Besides, it mentions that students have to use the wh-questions at the beginning or at the end of the activity.  It is good that the instruction tells us the students just studied this in grammar class yesterday.  So, we don't have to worry if the students don't know how to use wh-questions.Moreover, we can tell that the teacher walks around to check each group and provides students assistance.At last, I like the part, self evaluation.  It is vivid that I can feel the teacher, Susan Sheppard, evaluates herself after she does the lesson plan.  She also gives herself suggeations to improve this lesson in the future.The disadvantages of this lesson:Owing to there are many student groups in the class,
 it is impossible for the teacher to check the conversation contents all the time.  As a result, the students may have grammar errors or usage mistakes that the teacher can not correct them immediately.",4
123,"Hi, there:The following is my evaluation of Titanic Lesson Plan.Advantages:1.To employ asking questions to students as a kind of warm-up can let students have the blueprint of this lesson.2.Using the authentic material!Xthe Titanic script!Xcan somewhat promote students!, interests in learning English.3.The activity!Xplacing the scenes in chronological order!Xtrains students!, notonly reading comprehension but also organization.4.By dividing students in teams of two, students can do peer cooperation.Disadvantages:1.The teacher can put the feedback time within the teaching procedure to check if his or her students like this activity.Personal Comments on How to Use Titanic Lesson Plan:     I think this reading lesson plan can be used in both ESL and EFL settings.However, if this reading lesson plan is used in the EFL setting, students!, level should be probably in intermediate to advanced level.      If you are interested in this Titanic Lesson Plan, you can click here http://www.lingolex.com/userpages/Juliesl.html.

123,"The lesson plan that I found was for adults students in the high intermediate-advanced level.  The title is Individualism?Eand this is a speaking lesson plan.  This lesson's objective is that students will learn and demonstrate knowledge of the understanding of American individualism, specifically four areas: decision making, expressing opinions, competition, and obligation.  The activities in this lesson involve students very actively.  I found this lesson plan to be very useful and effective especially those who are planning to go to a college or a graduate school in the United States because they have to understand American culture, individualism.  Also, it is necessary for students to acquire discussion debate skill to study at a college in the United States, because it is very different from that in most Asian countries that students are required not express their opinions but to listen to the lectures.  The context in this lesson gives students opportunity to think about and compare their cultures with American culture, and I thought the content in this lesson is not like the exercises or some activities which are designed only for ESL students, but very intellectual and helps students develop their critical thinking in English.  The URL of this lesson plan is http://humanities.byu.edu/linguistics/lp/lpc1.html",4
123,"http://ssecinc.org/less/Pg_ls_social.htmThe above lesson plan is beneficial for the teachers in the following ways:1.Sources: References and resources can be found from the book list in the lesson plan. ESL/EFL teachers do not need to make a lesson but learn how to share lesson plans and resources with each other.2.Content: Content-based is used in the lesson. Students learn not only English but also fashion history, lifestyle which are helpful for the students to get involved in the American culture.My personal suggestion of the lesson plan:1.Time-needed: In order to make the teacher control and the process the activity well, it will be better to put the time-needed for each activity in the lesson plan.2.Objectives: The lesson plan mentions that the students are able to infer the values and lifestyle from historical point of view but the language objectives that the students are intended to achieve is not very clear. The language objectives should be specifically pointed out for the teachers. Such as what kind of language skills are needed in the lesson and which language abilities will get improved in listening, speaking, reading or writing. ",5
123,"Here is my comment on lesson plan which is listed under Elementary/appearances section.Lesson plan title  ?gTake a look in the mirror. What do you see??hThis lesson is composed with three activities. First, students write description of themselves followed by a guessing game in a class.  Second, the students have a group work and talk about the characteristics of their group member.  Third, as a wrap up, the class discusses the difference between how they think about themselves and how others see them. The purpose of this lesson is to promote students?f speaking and their appreciation of their individuality, ethnicity, and cultural heritage.  In addition, this lesson plan encourages the teacher to have the students find their positive traits.   Therefore, I think that this lesson gives ESL students great opportunities to share their rich culture and to promote their self confidence.  This lesson plan will smoothly fit into one day of lesson.  However, it is also possible to spend more than two days by adding extra activities such as asking their parents how do they (ESL students) changed over years, creating group posters, making a chart according to their findings, etc. The other reason I liked this lesson plan is that it promotes all four skills, speaking, listening, writing, and reading.  I believe that learning English using all skills altogether is especially important in ESL environment.  The students will be required to do so when they go out the classroom.  One suggestion I can make is that self-description format sheet (handout) will be helpful; the students need to fill in all columns about their physical traits and nature traits.  ",5
123,I spent about 30 minutes previewing this website and have forwarded it to several professionals in education.  This website provides accurate information which can assist professionals in collaborating for the benefit of the children from ESL families.  ,4
123,"ESL Flow, and some of the links to which it took me, represents the greatest treasure trove of online ESL materials I've seen in my 17 years of ESL teaching. I spent 25 minutes (this visit) trying various features of the site out. I took an interactive grammar assessment exam most of my students would find challenging. I found some excellent ""Icebreaking"" exercises, and I followed the links to the BBC World Service and to Transparent.com, where I signed up for free monthly newsletters in 3 foreign languages. The quality of the content on this site is rather high; it will most certainly enhance student learning, up to the Advanced-Intermediate level.Finally, first-time users and computer novices will find the site easy to use. Don Dunham (Assistant Professor of English / Broome Community College (New York)",5
124,"A useful tool to link students too. If a Creative Commons version was available to allow it to be shared other than an outside link, students might be more likely to take advantage of this information.",4
124,"The content is presented with enough examples that even students in a beginning level of writing can manage well. There is also a sample essay which will help learners to compare it with the information about the characteristics of an essay
In the section about the outline, it could have been useful to outline an actual example. It tells the user how to do it, but some students may highly benefit by seeing the outlining process

An easy site to browse. As you navigate the different sections, you will see buttons that take you back to the main page or lead you to another section. That makes the site friendly user. 
 I think the left side can be amplified as there is plenty of space left on the right side. There is information in the left side that can be enhanced since it does not appear in the center of the site. For example, there are sections titled ''Sample'' and ''Link'' that appear in the left section, which is very small. I think users might miss that information which can be very useful to have better understanding about the writing process.",5
124,"Easy navigation, relevant topics, and good beginner's materials. It would've benefited from some visual elements (e.g., diagrams, images, etc.).",4

The writing process is explained thoroughly.  It is a very effective tool for distance learning. The information is very clear and concise.  ",5
125,"I'm confused by this resource. It is listed as a Creative Commons information literacy tool that can be used for university or even graduate school instruction, but what appears on this link is a for-pay product that looks aimed at students in intermediate education. The literature regarding the tool is compelling, but I'm not sure what to make of it considering how it is listed.",2
125,"I'm hooked. I can't wait to watch/read more chapters. I am also curious to explore the ways that teachers use this in the classroom. The storytelling is quick and the animations are flashy, but this might be a preference for younger generations who are used to speedy media.",5
125,"In a word, WOW!  This is an interactive digital story.  It has your interest in the first chapter and you want to read more to find out what happens next.  It would be an excellent and engaging tool to use in a reading classroom.",5
125,"This is a wonderful example of digital storytelling.  Over time, new stories are added and each is enaging and an excellent reason for children to work on reading skills.  The stories take advantage of technology and the technology enhances the story rather than simply being an ""add-on.""",5
125,I teach adults about critical thinking.  The lesson plans along with the intriguing pictures and texts demonstrate how to delve into a subject beyond the written words.  Excellent.,5
125,"A great introduction, and good students sample, of digital storytelling. Students can definitely see the creative opportunities available if given such an assignment. Very easy to use and apply in a classroom (both face=-to-face and online). Technical Remarks:Viewer needs Flash.",4
126,This page cannot be found.,1
126,Very helpful for both students and faculty. The material can be used in Rubrics to help ensure that students are appropriately handling research information.,5
126,This is a solid resource for defining and discussing information literacy and instruction in higher ed.,4
126,Gives good information on information literacy from a librarian point its very good!,5
126,Provides an excellent overivew of information literacy from a librarian point of view.,5
127,"The site provides an opportunity to review various ""games"" that have math applications within.  The format and ease of the examples are easy to follow and enable the user to explore the ideas being presented within the game.

This site would be good to use in a variety of courses to explain critical thinking concepts and to illustrate how basic components may be used to solve more complex problems.Technical Remarks:The website is easy to use and well laid out for easy review and immediate use.

Not being a fan of math, the site enable me to play with concepts and ideas in a format that is not overwhelming.",3
127,I found this content to be excellent. It was fun and educating. I will use this for educational purposes for myself as well as my children. This material gave great models of math. easy for the first time user. It is also easy for children to use. It made math a fun thing. It can improve learning by adding fun which concepts.nice graphics with hands on learning,5
127,"I think the innerchild in me was immediately attracted to the words ""puzzle"" and ""games"" in the title of this post. I picked the interactive game ""Mastermind"" because I am most familiar with that game and thought I had a pretty good chance at beating it. Plus, we're learning a little about probability in my math class right now so I was hoping to apply whatever I learned about probability to the game. I found the game hard at first because of all the possible comibinations. Although I did not beat the computer, I had fun trying!!Technical Remarks:I think this is a great way to ""disguise"" mathematical concepts into something fun so that students with math anxiety or is doubtful of his/her math skills can ""play along"" without being intimidated!",4
127,"The math class that I am taking right now deals with, trying to find numerous ways to solve a problem. So, I really like this interactive mathematics application because it really exercises your mind and it's fun!Another thing I like about this is that, there's a variety of games to play!!I like the print out maze because it's easy and fun to make..and keeps your siblings busy.The quality of the content was very organize and easy to see.It's very effective because it's eye catching and engaging to learn.If someone could teach this, it would be very effective because it catches everyone's attention.It's very easy to use this material,even someone who never had use a computer could figure it out.",5
127,This is addictive and very challenging at all times. I have never looked at math puzzles before until I struggled with fun on this web sites. I have included my son and husband in trying to solve some of the puzzles I encountered here. My husband and I finally solve the rooster/hen puzzle without knowing that we actually switch sides and wife actually captured the rooster. After that the husband captured the hen. We now have a link on our computer for this math puzzles and actually recommend it to my son to go there and exercise his brain.,4
127,"I was kinda surprised about the math games and puzzles. I tried beating the computer for the coin game and it was hard. I tried some of the other games and some of them were interesting and not just simple or stupid math games that a kid can do. There were a lot of games and puzzles to do and not just three or four. The activities represented just as they said the point of the games were. The directions were easy to understand and follow. Perhaps they should include more things for higher math or games for different levels such as going from easy to extremely hard.

I think that this website reinforces the concept that learning can be fun,even more so with math. I think if using games, puzzles and other activities can not only help students learn and understand math concepts but also help teachers better help and engage students to learn math, it is a good tool to use. 

As a student I can say that I don't always like or understand math concepts sometimes, but if I had tools such as these to help reinforce concepts, it would change my way of thinking of math. We all learn in different ways, some are more literal or analytical, whereas others are more visual. I think this website would be a great tool for someone who is more visual, but in general it would be good for all. It is something different than how we usually learn math by attending class, taking notes, doing homework, taking tests, and who knows if your really getting the concepts or your just winging it.",4
127,"What better way to learn than to play around, which is what I did on this website. I played a game with coins made some changes and made some moves. Interesting for all ages,also will give you the chance for discussion.",5
127,"What a blast! In a society that feels that math has gotten boring and to a generation who feels that math is a dreadful experience, what better way to teach practical mathematics to students then using a the media of their age, the internet. I particularly enjoyed the wolf and rabbit game that has a rabbit jump across a river with answering math questions while the hungry wolf chases behind. I would be lying if you were to ask me that my heart was not pounding a little bit as I traveled from one side of the stream to the other in 14 seconds (which was my best time in the many times I played this game). This is a great resource to educators and instructors alike!",5
127,"a) This website got me hooked because of the plethora of Math Games and Puzzles that was on it. Of course for this game you would have to have a College-Level Math skill depending on the topic of course. Any ways I probably spent about an hour on some of these games because they were so challenging and fun.

b) The quality of the content was superb because all the games were fun and easy to learn type of thing. A lot of the games were related to different fields of math and is the best way to test your skills to the fullest.

c) The effectiveness for enhancing teaching is great because games and puzzles is the best way to increase your knowledge especially in math. A lot of students have a hard time in math and it's because they need something else that is very interactive to help them understand. By using games and puzzles like these will truly boost their knowledge of math.

d) It is easy to use this material because the entire site has a very simple and effective design with general navigation bars appearing on every page and on the Games/Puzzles page, the reader is always just a click away from the other site features.",4
127,I really liked this site. It had many fun and interesting modes of teaching classic mathematics.Technical Remarks:I think the content was vast and that it did an excellent job of presenting concepts accurately and with the right amount of levity to make it fun for the student.  These games are a great way to introduce new concepts to students.,5
127,"These game are interesting but a little bit confusing. I spend nearly one hour and a half playing all of them. However, I cannot figure out them at all. There are only 3 games that I can win the computer: vector problem, coin problems, and balance problems. They are kinds of algebra applications. Besides, I now still cannot understand the theory behind the first game named ""Farmer and Wife to Catch Rooster and Hen"" and the third one named ""Flipping Items Simultaneously."" Anyway, these games help me to realize that Math is not only the way of academic but it is also the way of playing.",5
127,"I really enjoyed playing some of the games on this site, I sent about an hour and forty-five minutes playing the games and reading how they are used and out together. Some of the games that I played where: Bachet's Magic Trick, Box Labels, Fish Soup, Number Guessing, Peg Solitaire and Flipping pancakes. Flipping Pancakes caught my attention when I was reading it, the part about permutations was interesting and I found that it helped me on my class work. I believe it helped me to understand the concept of sets better. I think that this site is a good tool for learning and teaching, even if it is fun to play the games. The visual concept of the game and math together, help to learn some of the basic concepts of math. Math is really part of our every day life and we don't see it, but when you use it in this type of form it shows you that there is some fun in learning. This site is built well and is easy to get around on and simple to use. It also has a great deal of games and puzzles to try, along with  some of the math that is used in it, very interesting site to visit.",3
127,"I chose this link because I am a firm believer in combining games with learning.  I spent at least 20 minutes trying out these puzzles and seeing how far I could get with them.  After I lost hope for figuring out the 3 glasses puzzle I scrolled down to see if there were any more to try.  I gave the 3 Jug problem one look and was lost.Technical Remarks: The site gave you games to play and puzzles to figure out and all you had to do was scroll down to get the solutions and explanations to the problems.  The 3 glasses problem was explained in a way that I could understand and I had fun trying it over and over again.  The 3 Jugs was really confusing, but probably because it was a concept that was just over my head in general.  The author did word everything very simply, though, which was helpful.  The material was well organized and explained nicely.  I think that the site presented the material accurately and I believe that they are educationally significant!  I felt that these games were kind of like critical thinking puzzles in addition to being related to math; sometimes math requires you to be a critical thinker.  I think that combining games and puzzles with math that would get the students really thinking would enhance learning and teaching.  I as a first time user had a little bit of difficulty with the harder concepts but other than that, I think this site is pretty user friendly.  The links are conveniently placed and labeled so they're easy to find and the software east to use.",4
127,I really enjoyed this site.  It's full of excitment and joy.  I thought the games and puzzles that this sight presented were a big help.  The gamez and puzzles teach you different concepts on mathematics.  It builds good problem solving techniques and prepares your for lessons.  I just loved it!!!!,5
127,"The three puzzles were contained in this area but so were many other games.  The one I selected this time was the Changing Colors.  I played the game for several minutes and was unable to successfully leave only one square white.  The patterns were repetitious even though a different number of squares were used.  	The solutions were definitely very educational however I did not easily understand the mathematical concepts that were used.  Perhaps after extensive study, these may have been learned with a good corresponding oral review.	I think both students?s learning and faculty?s teaching would be enhanced due to the complex nature or the formulas involved.	The software is very is easy to use but difficult to solve and process.",4
127,"I spent over an hour on this site playing the various games and checking out the background information on the activities. My family even got in on the fun, trying to solve some of the brainteaser games. This is a really good site if you are trying to find examples to illustrate different math techniques. There are some great games demonstrating a variety of new experimental forms of math. You can also find examples of Euclid?s Algorithm, cryptarithms, activities demonstrating functions, and much more. Any of these games are great tools to get someone, like myself, interested in math when it isn't your favorite subject. The content is great and the tools were very effective.Technical Remarks: I think the games were all easy to access and it was easy to navigate through the site. I found a lot of other great information on the main site, cut-the-knot.",5
128,"This is a very sophisticated plagiarism tutorial that goes beyond the usual easy answers. I really appreciated that even correct answers generated an explanation so that students learn even from lucky guesses. at the end of the tutorial, users can generate an email report to send results to the instructor which requires them to explain three rules for using sources -again, beyond the easy out. 
This is all formatted for MLA, but the information on plagiarism would be useful in any discipline. It's quick and easy to navigate. ",5
128,"This is a well-written and carefully nuanced learning object. I was impressed at how well the examples capture the common gray areas that students so often struggle with. Great use of a fun tone in the answer desriptions! (Would that we all were the ""Chuck Norris of plagiarism tutorial takers""!) Very clear and clean formatting. It's a nice touch to offer the option to skip back and forth through the tutorial to facilitate discussion of how different examples compare. Also, I was thrilled to see the inclusion of an email form so that students can do this on their own and submit their results to an instructor with evaluation built in!My only regret? That I didn't discover this tutorial before teaching a class along these very lines last week! Technical Remarks:Because the button at the end of the 10th question triggers the results page and email form popup, it's possible for a student to skip some questions and prematurely finish the tutorial. If they're clever, they can close the form, return to the questions they skipped, and retrigger the form, but this isn't obvious. It would be less breakable if the results page and form were triggered by all 10 questions being complete, not by the button at the end of the 10th question being clicked. Not a big problem because most students will just go through the questions linearly. Still, this would be a nice refinement.",5
129,"I love the explanation of Blooms Cognitive Theory because knowledge, comprehension along with analysis skills will help when trying to complete elearnings.  Keller's Plan, however, ties into the individuality one would need to complete the prerequisited plans I would lay out for each of my learners.Technical Remarks:Technically, I would need to provide a more modern approach in how I would teach a class.",4
129,"This document would have been of great use to me when I was in my introductory classes of instructional design.  Many of the references were sources I used to create a foundation in instructional design information.  I created a similar outline for use in my courses.  However, I think students would learn more if they created their own outline of relevant information rather than being provided the information.  With that said, this document would be helpful for me in teaching instructional design since it hits on all the major points. The quality of the content is extremely high.  The document provides an overview to the introductory concepts a student in instrucional design must know.  The material can be used in the introductory lessons of a intro. to instructional design course. Ease of use could use some work.  The bolding and changes in text size for the sections help readers with organization, but the document has alot of text and isn't very flexible since if you want to navigate back to a section you just have use the scroll bar.  Technical Remarks:It would have been since to have a clickable table of contents at the begninng to help with the organization and ease of reviewing.  In additon, knowledge checks and/or application questions would have been helpful after each section would aid students in the learning process.",4
129,"While this resource is more of a paper than a presentation, it does accurately convey an overview of the development of three of the contributing theories to instructional design.I would love to see some updates reflecting some of the theories that have been reconsidered or developed since the paper was written in 1998. I find it particularly helpful that the paper is available for download in both English and Spanish. The generous use of hyperlinks at the beginning of the essay is helpful, and I would like to see hyperlinks used through the essay to help the reader navigate easily back-and-forth within the document. Another helpful aspect is that the paper links to other papers from the same department, allowing a user to browse additional content that is not necessarily stored in MERLOT. The latest article at the site was from 2008, so I am not sure what this represents for the university department or the maintenance of that particular element of the web site.",4
129,"This paper provides thorough, high-level coverage of the three paradigms in learning theory: behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. Coverage includes history, explanation, and a thought-provoking comparison of the development of learning theory to the development of atomic theory.",4
129,"I spent approx one hour on the first day and about fifteen minutes on the second day. The paper discusses the learning theories but what was more interesting is how the paper demonstrated the relationship between the learning theories and their application to learning and teaching using educational technology. Of significance for me is how easily it suggests the effective use of these learning theories to online teaching and learning. Simultaneously, it describes the historical development of educational technology and how this development paralleled the development of new and modification of other learning theories.Quite obviously then, if these are appropriately used, faculty's teaching and students' learning will be enhanced.I found the site easy to navigate. Technical Remarks: I do not consider myself computer 'savvy' but I found it easy to use so I  see no reason for first time users to find it difficult.  Broad headings or the option of topics or authors etc. facilitate the navigation of this site.",5
129,"I truly loved this cite. I may use allot of the information to create my own tool in teaching others. I plan on becoming an Athletic Director. In order to achieve my ulitmate goal, my mentor has suggested that I start in the highschool ranks as a Guidance Counselor.Technical Remarks: Military and Industrial approach. I believe I can translate this approach into my own philosphy.Gagne's And Briggs model: 1. Action 2. Object 3. Situation 4. Capability to be learned. Young individuals as well as adult should apply this approach and I believe success will come.",5
129,"I am using this site in my Foundations of Instructional Technology class.  This is a good site for use in not only that class but - Instructional Design, Learning Theories, or other courses that require considering how design and theory are related.  The site provides a very good overview.  I may not agree with all conclusions within the paper, but the overall quality is good and the paper is well thought out. Technical Remarks: Since it is essentially a paper, it is easy to use.  All of the links work.",5
129,"An excellent paper that can provide an instructor of graduate instructional technology with several teaching opportunities: sample of a paper written by a graduate student, sample of a paper written in hypertext, an overview of learning theories and instructional design.Technical Remarks: The paper provides a good conversational tone regarding the many theories and definitions that will not put off students who struggle to understand these theories and their interconnectedness.  While the length of the paper will cause difficulties for students with reading disabilities or non-native speakers, the hypertext links help to compensate that, providing addiitional user control.  Also the ability to download the paper for offline reading is a plus.Students and faculty alike often struggle to understand how to write effectively for the online environment and this paper is a good example of how a ""traditional"" topic can be treated electronically.",5
130,This is a very useful website for students who learning to use APA style.  I provide this link to students in both my online and hybrid classes to assist them with their papers.,4
130,Have used Degelman's earlier APA versions for many years and in a variety of courses I taught. All versions were very helpful. Material is succinct and accurate.,5
130,Very informative website.  Provides numerous examples for quick reference.  Great resource for those new to APA method.,4
131,"This material is fun with a simple format covering 4 sections, and yet the different secions have their own unique exercises. The varied exercises, true/false, fill in the blank, choose the correct picture, etc. provide a good challenge and kept things fresh. The amount of material is great too. Some objects overwhelm with too much info, but this material gets it just right.Technical Remarks:Everything works good. No issues for me.",5
131,"This is a great site for independent study on grammar and vocabulary. The instruction is very informative, and the photos are taken at a real Chinese New Year Lantern Festival. I like the practical questions on real situations as well as the immediate feedback/correction and explanation for each answer.Technical Remarks: The overall design is very attractive with lots of colors and graphics. Links are user friendly, and the English texts and Chinese characters are clearly legible.",5
132,"This site proved very helpful in allowing my preservice teachers to design lessons on instrument grouping and sound identification.  The other feature that stood out was the make your own tune section.  The one criticism that may be warranted is that the ability to see the instruments being played would be beneficial.  Otherwise, this was a wonderful experience for my students.  ",4
133,"Chapters cover the history of bioethics, common terms used in healthcare ethics, ethical issues for nurses, the role of healthcare ethics committees, the process of ethical decision making, and major ethical dilemmas that come up in healthcare fields. It also includes a few review questions for each topic. It seems fairly comprehensive and might, with a few supplemental materials, make a good substitute for a commercial textbook.",4
133,"Unfortunately, this link takes you to a description of a CEU that can only be accessed through purchase. Basically, this is just an advertisement for a CEU.",2
134,"This is a fantastic material really understand the brain parts and sections. It is fully recommended for biology and related courses.Technical Remarks:In the class, the use is simplified enough for students and makes the material of the brain straightforward for learning. Since most learners are visual, it sticks absolutely for most student.",5
134,Very colorful and engaging. Nice job! I would like to find something similar that is simplified for patient education.,4
134,This is a great sight for the basics of the structure and function of the brain.  It is easy to use.  There are quizzes at the end of each section.  I particularly like the way the brain is separated and then put back together.  As each piece is placed where it belongs an  explanation of the function of that part is provided.  Great for into courses.,4
135,"The explainations about what techniques are used in political cartoons was well written and easy to understand.However, on the ""Test Yourself"" section all 4 correct answers were analogy.",3
135,Great idea with great material and resources. Enjoyed looking through and it most certainly sparked ideas for the future.Technical Remarks:The interactive quiz was a great idea. However I thought it would be a little bit more interactive. ,4
135,This is a great tool for helping students to think critically about the cartoons they are viewing on the editorial pages.  The explanations of the techniques are detailed and help students to understand how the technique is being employed.Technical Remarks:The site is not quite as intuitive as it could be.,5
135,"What a wonderful method for demonstrating the depth of political cartoons and providing interactive learning. I've used political cartoons in class before but now have a tool to prove their greater complexity beyond making us smile.Technical Remarks:I did have a few 'trial and error' attempts before I understood how the quiz worked, but not enough to discourage or frustrate me.",4
135,I like the interactive aspect of this activity. What a great way for students to learn about primary source political cartoons in an active and engaging way. This activity is a great way for students to learn about persuasion and bias depicted in political cartoons. Thank you for sharing!,4
135,I think this would be very useful for both the Critical Writing course I taught in the past and the Analytical Reasoning course I currently teach. Both courses include sections on visual literacy and this seems perfect in several ways.,4
135,I often use political cartoons in class and this site is essential.  Many of the cartoons are simply unavailable in any other format.,4
136,This is a great resource. The information is well organized and clearly defined. A feature I appreciated was the mobile access to the material. This resource could easily be encorporated in music courses and for all levels.  ,5
136,"This is a great material, well explained, with knowledge in the right levels, with the subject developed very precise, with simple and coherent examples. I reviewed this material alone, I like a lot the music and always the reading music issue has been complicated, it's the first time that I understand it well. I will be back to this material cause I want to study it and learn all the lessons. It's great.",5
137,"I've used this as the primary text in a critical thinking and composition course since 2017 for classes taught in person, asynchronously online, and synchronously online. It provides a strong foundation of content related to rhetoric and argument with concise introductions to key concepts. I have supplemented this text with readings and more detailed content lessons and class activities to provide students with multiple opportunities to engage with the content.",4
138,I think that VARK is a great tool and resource that teachers should use.,4
138,"A straightforward tool that has high face validity but little reference to research showing real analysis. Useful for teachers or preservice teachers to look at ideas related to learning styles, problem solving styles or multiple intelligencesTechnical Remarks: Can select more than one response for a situation. May be appropriate but little information given.",3
138,"The acronym VARK stands for Visual, Aural, Read/write, and Kinesthetic sensory modalities that are used for learning. The interactive learning styles inventory (VARK) provides immediate scoring (if you have Java script)based on a 14-item questionnaire.  Explanations of VARK scores are available that focus of effective study skills for learners with different learning preferences. Site also contains additional materials for the teacher educator including summaries of related research.",3
139,"Materials are of good quality and very easy to navigate, which makes this object valuable as a teaching tool. Target users need to have really attained solid intermediate/advanced levels in order to understand enough to immediately benefit. Professors need to be keenly aware of students' listening comprehesion level when assigning homework. Overall this object could be useful.",4
139,I used this web site for the my Classical Chinese course. The site is linked directly to my course web pages. The content of this page is interesting. The sound files are very clear. The online interactive exercises allow students to test they learning progress. Using the materials is easy even for the firt time users. ,4
140,"I love this site.  My master teacher and I use it to give the kids a break from lecturing and they really enjoy it.  There's a lot of information but I find we have to play it twice and thoroughly go over it with pausing because they tend to talk really fast!  

It's an excellent source!",5
140,"BrainPOP is fun and interactive for children. Only certain topics are unlocked, however. ",4
140,"I would definately use this in my classroom.  It was colorful, very easy to use and navigating around the site was also very easy.  My students would really get into this.Technical Remarks:Very easy to navigate the site.",5
140,"This site seems fun and easy for the students to use themselves. The movies they show before asking review questions are interesting and colorful. There are many activities, games and other fun learning tools on the site as well. I specifically like the word wall, which not only displays the word and definition, but verbally says the definition as well. Great strategy for ELL students and auditory learners.",4
140,"This website was very helpful in coming up with ideas on how to explain scientific concepts to children.What made it easy was the cartoons, they help make the concepts clear and easy to understand. I really liked how there were activity ideas given to help reinforce the concepts. The inter-activeness of the website is great, where you can take a quiz to see how much you understand about the topic. Which is a good assessment.Technical Remarks:The site was easy to navigate through and there were no technical difficulties involved with this site.",4

140,"I enjoy BrainPop and have used it in a classroom before.  It is eye catching, engaging, and filled with useful information.  The movies are wonderful and there are some really great games and interactive quizzes.  The only problem is that it is rather expensive.  I don't know if I would purchase this for my home, or purchase it out of pocket for my classroom.  If the school/district would be willing to add it to the schools network/computer lab I would most certainly use it quite often with my students.

There are a few topics in which you can view for free and I believe they change often.  I think this is a plus, especially if you want to test one out and see if it is worth the money for your classroom/student needs.  There is also a free trial!Technical Remarks:If you have a slower connection, it may take a bit longer to load.",4
140,"I have implemented BrainPOP Science in my science methodology class for elementary preservice teachers.  I taught a model science lesson for preservice teachers, who were preparing to teach their first science lesson in their field classroom.  I introduced my model lesson on sound with the sound video in BrainPOP Science.  I found the interactive material and animated movie to be accurate and an excellent way to enhance my elementary science example lesson.  The BrainPOP site is well organized and easy to locate science materials.  I believe this website would be a good resource for preservice teachers when developing their science lesson plans for elementary and middle school students.Technical Remarks: Need Macromedia Flash Player to view movie.",4
141,"This links into the Stanford Prison Experiment website. Very thorough, gives the background, events, and the outcome of the experiment. I would definitely use this in a class to show the step by step events of how psychologically trying it is to be incarcerated, even when as a simulation.",5
141,This is in MERLOT twice.,4
141,"This is a simulation of the Stanford Psychology Study on Imprisonment in 1971. It goes through a series of chapters in the process of incarceration as experienced by the student participants in the study. Each chapter consists of several slides, written descriptions, webcasts, and discussion questions. The presentation enhances the senses due to its graphic content and use of audio and visual media. The interviews of the participants make the whole experience very authentic and help the student to emerse themselves in an unforgettable way.The discussion questions tie back to the slide material and are rich in stimulating critical thought process and allow students to grapple with moral and ethical issues regarding incarceration.The website is easy to use. Simply click on the active links. The only concern is that you are not able to click on specific chapters in the slide show and therefore must start at the beginning each time. The Discussion Questions are in their own screens and are pertinent to the particular chapter under consideration.There are also links for obtaining the DVD, getting in touch with the author, FAQs and related links. The reader may also go to the Social Psychology webpage to get a wider overview of where this topic fits into the larger discipline.",5
141,The Stanford Prison Experiment has extensive resources on the original experiment as well as more recent implications for situations such as Abu Ghraib (Zimbardo was an expert witness).  See also The Lucifer Effect--see TED.com video clip--and The Hero Project on this site along with many articles and interviews.,5
141,"I generally use the video of the Stanford Prison Experiment, Quiet Rage, in my sociology and criminology classes.  This site would be a good alternative if you don't have the time for the video or access to the video.  The slide show captures many of the key incidents in the film, provides enough description for students to undertsand what's going on, and offers video clips from the film to make the effects even more real.  The slide show and other parts of the website also provide students with discussion questions and with connections to current and past prison events (Abu Ghraib, Attica, etc.).",4
141,1.  I spent about 1/2 hour looking at the clips and I also saw some of the clips in the classroom which is how I found this site.2.  The material very accurately presents concepts that are significant in education.3.  No Comment4.  It was easy to view the clips.,5
142,"MentalHelp.net is a very informative website that seems to focus more towards the layman rather than the professional. I would recommend it for reference, but I would not necessarily use it in a classroom. Many of the articles I read seem to be in blog format and not reviewed; although I am sure the information presented in each article is predominently accurate.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate; user friendly.",4
142,This website has a lot of useful information.  It was easy to navigate and first-time users should have no problem locating information.  I particularly liked the breakdown of the information into manageable segments.,4
142,This page gives a lot of useful information about ADHD and how it can be treated and what help the person may recieve to help them better understand the cause of ADHD.Technical Remarks: Easy to use,4
142,I have review this site for about 20 mins. This is a very informational site and very easy to get around. This had some very informational tools such as the ADHD test for adults which I had never seen on any other site before.Technical Remarks: This site is easily navigated for anyone.,5
142,"I spent quite a while reviewing the material on this website.  I found it very informative and helpful.  I never did quite undestand what ADD was and how much of an impact it has on people.  I was especially was surprised to find out that adults can have it too.  That's not something you hear too much about.  I think this website can definately help both teachers and students with learning about this.Technical Remarks: I found it very easy to navigate around the website and get the information I wanted and needed, so I definately think that first time users will have no problem with it.",4
142,I spent about 30 minutes at this site and thought it was very easy to read.  It was also easy to navigate.  It offered some great information on the subject of ADD/ADHD and I think this site will be very effective in enhancing teaching and learning.  Technical Remarks: First time users should have no problem using this site.,4
142,"The disorders and treatment site was an informative site that gave specific information on every disorder possible. After 1 hour of browsing the material I felt that the content of the material does specifically address disorders and treatments that are educationally significant.My knowledge of many issues has been expanded, so therefore I believe this site would be an excellent learning tool for students and educators. Technical Remarks: Once I was in the site I found navigating to be simple and specific. I do believe a first time user would find it fiarly easy to use.",4
142,I found this site to be very informative especially since i am a nursing student.  It had alot of information on mental illness i did not knwo of.,4
142,I am really glad I found this website.  After spending a good hour I couldn't wait to share this information with people I know that would value the materials within.  I think people might be able to better understand the information once brought to their attention.Technical Remarks: Not being a computer genius I found this site very easy to use.  I have had trouble in the past trying to find information in this area and was relieved to find this site was simple but yet very useful.,5
142,"After locating this website, I spent approximately 45 minutes to an hour reviewing all of the information that this website had to offer. I examined the link regarding symptoms, which gave me a broad overview of ADD and ADHD. I also examined the links regarding what exactly these disorders are, possible treatment options, various on-line resources on these disorders, diagnosis of ADD and ADHD, where to go for help and a reliable diagnosis, support organizations, ADHD quiz, on-line support group and new research findings. In my opinion, the quality of the content was of a highly credible nature and it was most definitely educationally significant. This website acts as a great teaching/learning tool as it provides such a complete background on these disorders, while directing the viewer to other sources for further reading and research. I do believe that this resource would absolutely enhance both the educator and student's knowledge of these topics to a strong degree.Technical Remarks:Personally, I found it very easy to navigate around this website--I felt that everything was easily accessible and clearly stated. First time users should not have a problem navigating this website. I would highly recommend this website as it is very well-organized and presented, while providing a great deal of useful information.",5
142,This site was extremely informative on the topic of ADD and ADHD. I spent quite awhile browsing through the links and looking at the different sections of the site. I found the material beneficial for everyone from those with the disorder to those just interested in learning about it.Technical Remarks: I think the site is very user-friendly and even me as a first time user found it very easy to understand and find the things I needed to.,5
143,This is an excellent resource for students enrolled in Health Sciences. This site will greatly benefit students enrolled in the Nursing program; there is a direct application to their field. I would recommend the inclusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its role in healthcare setting. Consumer snapshot is a great way of showing applicable information to daily life.,5
143,"The site was a bit bland, but it was a rich source of information. This would be a good site for older students to find more indepth information.",4
143,I would recommend this site for students looking to learn more about specific pathogens and toxins.  It is a great jumping-off point and would be a wonderful first resource for a class presentation.,5
143,I spent time utilizing this information and also developed a lesson plan for it.  The quality of the content is excellent and very well organized.  This is a very concise and usable site.  Student's could benefit from this site if it is incorporated into lessons effectively.  ,5
143,This is an excellence source of information for nursing students in their public or community health courses. Would the contributor please add nursing as an interest site?A case study would be helpful at the site.,4
143,"Anyone interested in a concise discussion of the microbes and toxins causing foodborne disease should check out this site. Each page discusses the organism and the disease including the factors contributing to infection. This site is text only and can be downloaded in a compressed version for printing by accessing the link to the preface. However, the online version has links to search results on recent outbreaks from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publication ""Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports"" and to abstracts of recent articles through the NIH Pub Med site. Additional information can be accessed by connecting to appendices on epidemiology, infectious dose, and factors that influence microbial growth in foods.Technical Remarks: The link to NIH PubMed is to the old site from which one can access the latest version of PubMed.",4
144,"It was a beautiful site, very eye-catching. Even though it has a lot of animations, the site is still simple to navigate. I enjoyed the games, and had a lot of fun.",5
144,"The Site is fantastic! Since one of my speializations is brain-based education, I found this an extremely usable Web resource, with just dozens and dozens of great links and activities! 
Beyond this under the ""free-stuff"" link is a link called ""Brain Pop for Educators"". Wonderful things await the teacher that will utilize these resources.Technical Remarks:Very easy to navigate and to use. I found that all apsects of the technical navigating to be designed appropriatedly and extremely efficient for students and teachers alike!",5
144,"This is a great low anxiety way for studets to access information. Visual and audio learners can enjoy animated movies and acquire knowledge on different subjects.

Students would have to join inorder to access all movies.

Due to vocabulary maybe suitable for older students.Technical Remarks:Home page was crowded and flashy, great for children. Maybe difficult to walk students through to where they need to go.",5
144,"I navigated through BrainPop. This was an interactive site that featured videos for student learning, quizzes to test pre-post video, and review quizzes to help students learn more about a particular subject. 
I viewed the English section of BrainPop. Everything from simple writing techniques to specific literature reviews is offered. 
The subscription for a school access is slightly out of my range and would require me to ask for a grant. The teacher access is more affordable, for $175.00. This allows two teachers access for 12 months and 3 computer simulations. The great news is that the list of New York State schools that currently utilize BrainPop is quite extensive.
This site is most definitely addicting. Reviewing how some teachers utilize this site gave great inspirational tools.",5
144,"Looking through this website, I find it very fun, interesting, and informative.  I think it is a great site to use in the classroom, at home, or just for fun.  It has all kinds of subjects and is very easy to navigate.  I love how this site teaches with videos that not only allow kids to hear and see how things work but are also very colorful and eye-catching.  The only issue with this website is that it costs to have access to the whole site, but I definetly think it is worth it.",5
145,Great animations.  Simple and easy to use,5
145,"It should be noted that these animations refer to human animation.  However, comparisons between human and zebrafish heart development provide useful material for instruction.Technical Remarks: The animation does not play in Windows Media Player.  It was necessary to download Quicktime as the default media player.",4
146,This is very basic. I would have like for it to be taken farther with net ionic equations too.,3
147,"The site has too much advertising, and the information given is not always accurate.",2
147,"Very clear structure will be valuable to students at all levels who are confused by the construction of a citation.  The in-text feature takes this beyond OWL, which, although more comprehensive, requires more patience.",4
147,"I like the functionality of inputing the ISBN to get the reference information.  Overall, it's easy to use.  User interface could probably be improved, but then again, this is a free site used more for ad-placement than anything else.",3
148,Good material.,4
148,Very nice site that covers a ton of information regarding basic computer skills. One nice feature includes the links you can click that displays the various operating system look and feel.  One distracting feature is that the site and material seems cluttered and could be better organized.  Maybe use a table of contents with links to each section might help organize/structure the information or lesson.,4
148,"Very user-friendly presentation and easy to use and understand. Attractive and well-presented screens. However some of the material may need updating, as some ""older"" technology is being presented, while more up-to-date ones are either discussed later or not at all.Technical Remarks:More flexible navigation, right now primarily page to page, however it may be better to have hyperlinks on specific terms and related topics and allow for navigation through those as well.",3
148,A bit datedTechnical Remarks: Navigation could be improved.,3
148,"I found this site to be very user friendly and fun to use. It was filled with a lot of ""hot links"" to various reference areas to provide further information. I learned a lot in a short period of time. This site would be terrific for the computer novice but it also is a great site to refresh more experienced computer users.",5
148,I tried the first module on storage devices and found it very clear and helpful. The quiz gives you feedback right away so you can correct any wrong notions you have immediately.Technical Remarks: I would find this helpful for any class where I needed to be sure my students were at a certain basic level of technical understanding for a course.,5
149,I use Creative Commons content in my work so it is important to model expectations for other educators. This particular page within Creative Commons helps clarify to my student teachers and classroom teachers the licensing aspect of Creative Commons. Being able to see the actual choices in the licenses quickly and clearly makes a difference.Technical Remarks:No technical issues or concerns.,5
149,"I spent about 30 minutes with this site and found it to have good production value. I viewed the ""How It Works"" cartoon on the concept of creative commons. The material is presented in a way that is easily understood and makes it fun to learn the concepts involved! This site should give students a better understanding of copyright issues and provide a way to find digital content to use in their presentations without having to pay or ask permission.Technical Remarks:The site layout is well-designed--clear, uncluttered, easy to navigate, in other words, user-friendly. I like the choice of fonts and colors, which make for easy reading.",5
149,"Very easy to understand. I spent about 30 minutes viewing the comics, the projects, and the wiki. Many course developers have questions about licensing the material they create, especially learning objects, this site will be very useful in explaining options to them. The material can also be used with our students, especially those creating digital content such as blogs and music.",4
149,I spent about 20 minutes with viewing this site and found it to be of great value. I view the how it works cartoon on the concept of creative commons.  The material is easily understood and makes it fun to learn the concepts  that are involved. The maybe should have given a little bit of an understanding of the issues that are copyright and should present a way to find digital content to use in their presentations without having to use permission and paying for it. But in all the site design was well spectacular and I would very think of it as user friendly.,3
149,Information competence is a component of our course for teaching online.  This collection makes it easy for students who create online learning materials to understand legislation for sharing of online materials.Technical Remarks: Information on how to mark content with copyright and terms of use on a web page is provided in HTML with a display button through easy-to-follow guidelines.,5
150,This is a very nice collection of southern historical literature.  Searchable many differant ways. ,5
150,"Upon revisiting this site to move beyond a cursory browsing of its contents I am now even more greatly impressed by its breadth of material and perhaps even more so by its ease of navigation. Handsome and effective in design and mechanics this site will be a great source for undergraduate and graduate students and their instructors. Organized broadly into genres and then meticuously into alphabetized subject, it is clear site designers sought to make this site as user friendly as possible given their task of accomadating such a vast cache of digitized material. The search engine (powered by Google) is quick and thorough and the date retrieved provides sufficient information to avoid blindly trekking into the material retrieved. The contents contain myriad white and black primary documentation including, entire books from the ""beginnings to 1920;"" first person narratives, slave narratives, non-military lifeways, the black church, and North Carolinian literary artifacts, representative histories, and sundry memoranda. Searches may be done by author, subject, or title. There is a coments and feedback section as well. Have at it! Just a few sample searches culled a wealthy of material on such diverse subjects as antebellum amusements, blackface, and diversions, to war aims, and political and religious tracts. WSTechnical Remarks:You will need to have the Acrobat (5.0) reader. No other audio/visual software appeared necessary but this may change as the site expands its resource base.",5
150,"The quality of content, ease of use, and effectiveness of this site are all superb.  Its collection of slave narratives alone would make this an invaluable resource, but Documenting the American South has an extensive collection even beyond these texts.  The site includes some excellent secondary materials as well, such as William L. Andrews's introduction to the slave narrative, excerpts from the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, and so forth.  My American literature classes have used this site for several semesters, and it has provided a wealth of materials for research.",5
151,"Overall, this site is outstanding.  One of my students referred me to it and I have used in as a Learning Object in my classroom ever since.  My students have found it helpful at looking at the synaptic interactions as well.Technical Remarks:Flash required but the LO is very smooth and well designed",5
152,"The expetise of the CEC on matters relating to the education of exceptional children is invaluable. I reviewed the CEC's Professional Policies and Positions on Response to Intervention and saw that a lot of comprehensive analysis has taken place.The three approach to implementing RTI has been well explained making it relatively easy for use by all sstakeholders in the education of children with disabilities.When I first studied RTI into detail, I was a bit confused about RTI implementation at the third tier level. My confusion stemed from the fact that if the maximum range of interventions of RTI at the third tier were rigourously implemented and to the letter, then the need for subsequent referral of any student for evaluation for the purposes of receiving special education services were quite minimal. However, I see that the position of the CEC's position is similar to that of the federal legislation in that the process of RTI implementation is not necesarily an end by itself.This s yet another demonstration of the CEC's invaluable role as a pioneer in advocating, shaping and upholding the interests of persons with disabilities.",5
152,I have used this tool in my occupational therapy classes.  The Primer offers a good overview of the law.  This is a good example of how dynamic legislation is and how important it is to keep up with the changes that evolve over time.  The Council for Excpetional Children is a recognized leader of resources and this particular topic is covered extensively.,5
152,"The IDEA Practices website contains an incredible amount of information related to IDEA, the nation's fundamental special education law. I have used this site with special education teaching credential candidates in a course related to IEPs and special education legislation. Seeing how the law is actually carried out, hearing about ongoing legislation as it relates back to IDEA, and having a clearinghouse of information available to them was an invaluable experience. I found the most beneficial part of the site to be the sections where IDEA is related to areas that are of utmost concern to students as they go through theirtraining programs - areas such as assessment, cultural and linguistic diversity, curriculum and instruction, family and community, and general education.",5
153,"I liked the concept of simple, straightforward ethical situations that allow the learner to identify a situation then to provide a response.  I would probably rate this material higher if I had actual usage in a classroom or business environment. The individual mini-cases were very factual and are focused on everyday occurrences in the business setting.Technical Remarks:I had no technical issue and mini-case series was relatively easy to open and progress through. Did not see the need for any special technical skills, hardware, or software.",4
153,"Very nicely done.  If fact, this is better than some of the interactive implementations that we currently use for internal ethics training. Might want to rethink the scoring since some organizations have specific policies (right answer, wrong answer).Technical Remarks:Some of the longer case studies could be broken up into smaller pieces and would still be effective.",4
153,"I looked at these materials and tried the mini cases to test my knowledge.   I found that the interactivity really would allow students to gain an understanding of key concepts such as ""conflict of interest"" much better than a textbook.  The explanations for the ratings provided are rational and well thought out.I am strongly considering using this material with a homework assignment to enhance my ethics lecture in an introductory business course.It is important to note that there is a very broad array of longer ethics case studies as well, which may be useful for upper division students. (I saw one which was 70 pages...)Technical Remarks:The site is very easy to use: read and click. If you start examining the longer case studies you may find it hard to get back to the mini cases.Some of the longer cases are more technical in nature, and contain technical jargon.",4
154,This is a site that allows users to find out what it is like for those who have disabilities.  It is an excellent way to begin a discussion in classrooms about accommodations and approaches to those who learn differently.  I highly recommend it and use it.,5
155,"The material covered is good, but dated. It seems to be a promotion for a textbook on netiquette.Technical Remarks:It takes Java a very long time to load. It could use a loading icon. Also, knowing how many questions there are would help the learner to know how much longer the quiz will be. The design of the site seems to be very outdated technology-wise.",2
155,"The site has good information about email ettiquette but seems to be a bit dated. The newest copyright on the site is 2011 but many of the pages list a much older date. After some digging I was able to find some references to social networking but the resource primarily focuses on email. I would encourage the author to redesign the site to address current technology.Technical Remarks:The Nettiquette quiz requires java to run which will limit its use on mobile devices. In Google Chrome on Mac, the quiz was cut off on one side and difficult to read. ",2
155,"This is a good start at Netiquette; however, I can see professors modfying the questions to be more specifice to their course adn their course communication.I missed a few questions because I didn't realize a new question appeared.  A next and back button would help in the usage in case someone wanted to review the choices again.",3
155,very interactive and provides useful tips on etiquette. i used with one student and she was pleased with it.Technical Remarks:It is java application and java must be installed,5
155,Good introductory or refresher task at beginning of course or lesson on uses of or incorporating electronic exchanges.Technical Remarks:User friendly with feedback on each question and at end of the quiz.,4
155,"For individuals new to online communication (e-mail, discussion boards, chat rooms, etc.), this web site provides some very helpful tips. I took the online quiz myself and found it to be quite user friendly and informative.  I plan to integrate this site into my online class orientation at the beginning of the semester.Technical Remarks: This site is relatively easy to navigate.  Additional graphics and color would create a more engaging environment.",4
155,This quiz is a quick and easy way for beginning and experienced online students to be aware of civility on the web. The home page provides more detailed information that is also valuable if an instructor chooses to devote more time to this topic. Technical Remarks: The text on the quiz itself could have been larger. The quiz itself was well designed giving immediate feedback and a detailed explanation of the correct answer.,5
155,"I went through and took the quiz and then read the follow-up comments of each response. Then I went back and tried each answer, reading the corresponding feedback that follows the answer, whether right or wrong. Since I needed a non-threatening, non-punitive way to teach netiquette to a group of college freshmen who would be actively involved in email communication with their peers, I tried the quiz with a group of twenty students. I found that the students were surprised at some of the responses to their answers, which indicated they really needed the awareness the quiz gave them. They weren't as threatened by the ""computer's"" answer and took it well when they missed something. I didn't have to be the ""bad guy"" or ""heavy"" while exposing some of them to things they were unaware of.Technical Remarks: The quiz was very easy--and effective. With some of the first time users--there weren't many--it took a minute to get them to the site. Then they were fine.",5
156,Thank you for putting the time into this. It will help me as I prepare to work in an APRN role,4
157,"Well developed website, and content.",3
157,"I have taught this course on my campus about five times.  Students who complete the work report the following  Most earn perfect scores on the Concept Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS) from JRST Vol. 39 (10): 952-978, 2002, and  most resolve any perceived evolution/faith conflicts for themselves and their students.Technical Remarks:For creating and sharing lesson plans, we are currently using KEEP Toolkit.  The link shows the evolution lessons presented and discussed at the 2005 MERLOT International Conference in Nashville, TN.",5
157,"I found the section, ""How to Deal With Controversy"" very informative and well designed.I suggest two books, by John Haught, for those who are interested in exploring the science-religion dialog in more depth. Haught's brief biography at meta-library.net states, ""Jack (John) F. Haught is Landegger Distinguished Professor of Theology at Georgetown University. His area of specialization is systematic theology, with a particular interest in issues pertaining to science, cosmology, ecology, and religion.""Haught, John. God After Darwin: A Theology of Evolution.  Westview Press, 2001.  ISBN: 0813338786Haught, John. Deeper Than Darwin: The Prospect for Religion in the Age of Evolution.  Westview Press, 2003.  ISBN: 0813365902Two websites also worthwhile are Zygon Center for Religion and Science and Metanexus Institute.",5
157,"I have used this tool as both a student and an instructor.  Needless to say, I have spent many hours with this tool.  The content is very good and the website lends itself to be a very effective tool to enhance learning and teaching.  It presents concepts and models that are educationally significant in many different formats, which I find to be very efficient in learning and teaching.  The presentations direct students through the learning process and the material is arranged in a logical order that moves students through their learning process at their own speed.  The students have access to the materials, as long as they are near a computer, and can go through the material as many times as they need to understand.  As a teacher, I found that the material helped the students learn the material because of the many different approaches it takes.  The website uses video, pictures, discussion based notes and activities based on real teachers experiences in the classroom which makes it more personal to the students.  There are also a lot of additional resources that students can access to help them learn and that teachers can use to enhance their teaching.The material is very easy to use.  I have a fellow teacher (math) who is, shall we say, technologically challenged who went on to the website to review it for a class that she was taking to finish her clear credential.  Not only did she enjoy the material and its organization (she went through all of the lessons) but she learned a lot about evolution and has a better understanding of why science teachers love doing what they do!Technical Remarks: I would suggest a faster connection (like DSL) to aid in viewing the videos.  I had no problems accessing any of the materials. ",5
158,"This is a resource details the process of conducting research online and discerning whether a website might be trustworthy. It's got a ton of useful information and it is formatted in a manner that is easy to navigate. The information is presented pretty dryly and the resource could benefit from some graphics, however it is nearly 20 years old and still an effective reference tool for students willing to click through.",3
158,"The material is straightforward and easy to use, telling users what is offered, what the outcomes or goals of the offer materials should be, and why usrs should be interested.  It leans a little toward the intermediate library user, however, rather than the first-time or casual library user.  Language directed more toward first-time users might be more likely to increase usage and attract that clientle.",4
158,"Because so much information is available, and because that information can appear to be fairly anonymous, 
Because anyone can write a Web page, documents of the widest range of quality, written by authors of the widest range of authority, are available on an even playing field. It is necessary to develop skills to evaluate what you find which is why the site provides criteria that can be used to assess information found on the Internet. Excellent resource.",5
158,"The resource contains good information for an instructor to share with their students on verifying the validity of a website. Even though the materials are older the ""Criteria"" are just as applicable today. A few of the links are broken so the ""sample"" sites need to be updated.Technical Remarks:There are several broken or out-of-date links in the site.",4
159,Quickly looked through the site. It looks like a very useful overview of the Mongol invasions and their aftermath.Suggests many resources that might be of use to an instructor.Navigation of the site is clear and intuitive. ,4
159,I am planning a biographical assignment for my students on Genghis Khan and am going to use this site as a secondary source for them to investigate and evaluate him. I found the outline of information user friendly and did not have to spend hours finding the what I needed to answer the tasks that my class must address.Technical Remarks: The link was easy to explore and self explainatory. I believe my freshman class will have little difficulty navigating.,5
159,"I am a college student, using this site as part of a class project. I choose this site because I wanted to educate myself on something I knew nothing about. I thought the site had a very nice interface, whose graphics and organization of material made navigation easy. Small, organized blocks of text are much less intimidating to read than solid pages of text. Each topic and sub-topic is separately organized, but very easy to find, in case you need to easily find something particular. Some key words on the site are linked to pictures offering examples. I found this very useful, and only wish there could have been more of it. The site doesn't offer the most extensive information on the subject, but summarizes the key points. You can educate yourself on all the aspects of Mongolian rule in China in a short span of time. So, obviously, the only thing lacking would be more detailed and more referenced information (although there was quite a bit of referenced information on the site). If you aren't satisfied with your Mongolian education after perusing this site, you can always go elsewhere - the site, in fact, helpfully links to other useful sites and books regarding the specific topics found here. This site is just a taster, and I think ideal for students first exploring the topic.",5
159,"I spent about 15 minutes browsing the site and reading the different categories of focus.  The website seemed very well organized and provided an abundance of information on the subject (The Mongols in World History).  The information seemed factual and provided illustrations and visual examples for the information presented.  The information reflects an important area of world history and strikes me as educationally significant.  It seems that if the website is used correctly it will definitely serve as an effective tool for learning.  The website strikes me as being applicable to an older audience, possibly secondary education (high school) students.  The category should also be easy to use as the home page itself is clearly broken into separate categories of foucs that are links to the different areas of study.Technical Remarks: The website represented a modern use of the advances in website presentation.  The site looked very professional and the use of different fonts and colors was utilized well.  The site seemed to illustrate a good use of technology.",4
160,"I have not used this in a classroom setting; however, as a doctoral student myself, a position in addition to my teaching repsonsibilities, I found these resources very helpful for assistance in writing scholarly papers.Technical Remarks:Most things are an easy, clickable link from one page to another",4
160,"I really like this website.  This website is a helpful source for high school and college students.  The website is aimed for college students, but I think high school students could benefit from it too.  I like how it gives a lot of detail and examples of writing.  It is a quick and easy source to look up key terms of writing.Technical Remarks:This website is very user friendly.  It is arranged in a well organized way. The set up makes it easy to find different topics.",5
160,"I spent about ten minutes on this site. I find this web site attractive. the content is very engaging and practical. This site has information for students who have a problem with grammar, essay construction, paper presentation and thesis writing. It has the potential for enhancing teaching and learning if appropriately used. It is also very easy to navigate. Technical Remarks: There is no complicated technical requirements. Accessing all areas is easy",5
160,"Good site for reviewing writing basics with interactive exercises for reinforcement. The Essay Writing and Research Room sections provide practice advice on academic writing. The entire writing process from developing the thesis idea, researching, writing and revision are discussed and illustrated. College students are the target audience for this site.  I spent about an hour at the site checking out the links and trying the interactive exercises. The site is a great resource for teachers and students in any discipline where writing is required.Technical Remarks: The site is intuitive to use. The reader can quickly go to topics of interest from menu links or links within a topic page. Interactive exercises provide immediate feedback.",5
161,"Very well made, exceptional documentation, citations, resources.  If it listed common names with the scientific names this would be much more user friendly.  As it is my high school students would be spending too much time sorting through scientific names and not enough time studing the species.",4
161,After spending an hour on this site (and still not seeing everything!) I knew it was a great site to create an assignment for. I had fun looking at pictures and learning about the kingdoms.  Students will enjoy the adventure.<,4
161,"This is an excellent overview of classification systems for the living kingdoms.  Descriptions, along with pictures and references, are provided for representatives within each of the kingdoms.",4
162,There are examples on this site of everything from Stowe's handwritten pages of manuscript to examples of art and stage. The teachers hints in the interpret mode were helpful as well.I could use parts of this in my middle school history class.,5
162,"I highly recommend this for high school or college teachers working with UTC. This provides a lot of historical context in multiple media, as well as critical essays from scholars that teachers can use as exemplar texts with students. ",4
163,Great acid base tutorial that you can print out a certificate at the end to prove that you've gone through the entire program.,4
163,"I spent about 10 minutes with this simulation.  It is well done, and is very clear for students at a relatively low level.The presentation is focused on the general idea of a titration, rather than on the technical details - measuring volumes, reading a buret, etc.  I see that as a strength for what appears to be its target level.  However, it would be nice to see these details in a higher-level presentation.",4
164,This is site has a lot of information about the different eras in visual form.  It also has sample pictures of fossils that are very interesting to see.  I really enjoyed the animations and learned a lot.Technical Remarks:No problems with the site.,4
164,I ended up finding much more information then I expected. Ended up finding tons of ideas for lesson plans.,4
164,I loved this site.  I spent an 30 minutes exploring the website and forgot I was supposed to be looking for other information.  I liked that I was able to nagivate through it easily.  It was engaging and really interesting.Technical Remarks:No problems with the site.,5
164,"I logged on to Virtual Museum of Fossils and spent at least 2 hours trying it and brought in a student assistant new to geology to try it as well.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the site explained Plate Tectonics in conjunction with the Geologic Time Scale -  two difficult subjects for  beginning EarthScience students to grasp.Geologic Time and Plate Tectonics are taught early  in Earth Science courses, as they are fundamental  to understanding earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and other geologic processes  and the vast amounts of time it takes for these  features to form. Virtual Museum of Fossils integrates these topics visually, so that students will grasp theprinciples more quickly.  The site is very easy to use:  Select the Jurassic Period and the position of the continents during that time period is displayed. Move the mouse over the dinosaurs button to  see where in the world they roamed.  Then click on  the Tertiary Period and see what happened to the dinosaurs!The graphics are well designed and high quality and many teaching modules can be developed around the themes.Even though the site has 2 links under construction, (Find an animal and take a tour), it is still a highly effective teaching and learning tool.",4
165,"I recommend this site to all students -- not only those who have never used a microscope, but for those who want a quick refresher.  Well done!",4
165,"I took about an hour to browse through the site. There are many things to try out and explore. I actually remember looking at many of the same slides in high school, but this site ensures quality images whereas hand prepared slides are often lacking that professional touch. The site was very easy to use and navigate through and has the potential to be a great way to re-introduce students to microscopes without the mess of being in the lab.",4
166,This website engages students in their learning about Biomes. The interactive games are a great to reinforce the students learning and helpful for ELL students.,4
166,I've used this one before. I think I may have this posted among my MA resources for NASA RESOURCE DRIVEN INSTRUCTION. I love the vocab content. It works great with my EL students.,4
167,"I would use this as a graphing practice tool for my students.  I like the more information page.  Before using the site, you will need to teach and practice graphing using slope-intercept.  Technical Remarks:A snap grid would work best with the graphing tool.  It was difficult to place the point and the line.",4
167,"Learning how to graph a line was quite easy with this program. It taught me where to place the mark for the Y intercepts and a learned more about the rise over run theory. The next step after graphing the lines is to now solve for Y!Technical Remarks:It was kind of buggy because when I wanted to put in the Y intercept, it kept giving me a hint and never let me put it in. I had to refresh and do a new problem.",3
167,"I think this a great teaching tool as it provides hints and instructional support as the student attempts to use the applet.  For example, if you get the y-intercept number correct but did not take into account if it was potitive or negative, it will tell you to focus on the sign.  Also if you get the slope mixed up for run over rise instead of the correct format it will hint at correcting for ""rise over run"".  A great tool for any level of education.Technical Remarks:Java required",5
167,"I think that this is site is a great tool to assist individuals with one of the most frequently mistake and often times more difficult tasks to accomplish in the classroom: Graphing. I think that the site is very user friendly and assists greatly with the graphing process. I found when using the site however, it can be a bit touchy and being off ever so slightly when moving the line around on the graph does make it not quite as user-friendly as I would prefer, but all things considered, a very effective and helpful site.",3
167,I felt the applet would be very beneficial to help students and test their understanding of graphing using y = mx + b.  This program would be great to use as a computer work day with or without a partner in class.  It gives hints and corrects students as they make mistakes.Technical Remarks:The use of the internet would help attract all students especially those who are technologically driven.,4
167,"My first reaction after exploring this website was Amazing.  I spent few hours in browsing, exploring and understanding the material. This website is very useful for students who are enrolled in algebra. It briefly explains the Equations of Lines. This website has a great feature, where you can practice graphing online. When you click on Information on graphing lines it also shows us the definition of parallel and perpendicular lines. I remember when I was enrolled in an Algebra class many students were confused about the perpendicular lines. I think this website has great and organized instructions on how to solve a problem. It also has some examples, so that we can understand the material better. This website also has two point slope formula that I have studied in my finite mathematics class. This website not only gives us information on how to solve a problem, but also educates us about formulas. It has some useful links so that you can explore some more information. I think students will learn the material better, if they explore this website. At last I would like to say that, it is very useful website to learn about Graphing the line y = mx + b and I would recommend to everyone to explore the material.",5
167,This site is extremely helpful for those enrolled in an Algebra class. It helps students to be able to determine differences between rise and run which is used for the slope of the line. It identifies how to dissect an equation in the y=mx+b format to properly graph a line. The site also helps in graphing more than one line (parallel and perpendicular lines). This site provides great help for students in graphing lines and will definitely help build a strong foundation for any future math classes. The site provides quality formulas and has links to other sites for any other help needed for an Algebra class. This site is a great resource and I believe this would be an effective tool for helping students to learn and refresh on graphing the line y=mx+b.,5
168,Unable to access. Your link to create a new login account just times out.,2
168,The steps involved in designing the rubric walk you through the process in a way that forces one to connect the assigning of the grade and the learning objectives of the product.  I will use this again.Technical Remarks:Returning to incomplete rubrics requires one to move through the steps linearly from the beginning (e.g. you can't jump straight to step 5 even if 1-4 are already completed).  I don't see a way to  increase the weight of a category or to modify the points for different categories.  Printing options are limited.,4
169,This is an excellent tool for groups to explore their own temperament as well as that of others in the group. The site provides guidance for how each type succeeds in school and at work in addition to basic background information. The test results using this site were the same as I have received using similar assessments i.e. MBTI.Technical Remarks:The site requires a bit of exploration but with persistence many resources can be located.,4
169,"I spent 45 minutes reviewing the site, the documentation and completing the instrument. In completing my master's degree, I used the site for a course in adult learning theory.The temperament sorter provides a generalized guideline that is most helpful when supplemented with class discussion and supporting materials.Technical Remarks: The instrument is intuitive, very easy to use. It may be difficult for the novice to locate the instrument on the site, so specific directions are in order.",4
170,"There are pieces of this I really like.  I am hoping to find more dynamic interaction to really excite our modern learners.  However, I do recognize this format is probably beneficial to meet ADA compliance needs.",3
170,"I used this site link as a supplementary resource to my classroom teaching for junior high students.  It has a lot of good information and images that are easy to read and use for students.Technical Remarks:The text on the first page is hard to read when it overlaps with the image.  The backgrounds on the pages are distracting and hard to the eyes after a few seconds, with the contrast to the text.",3
171,"Very useful tips for students. Written and audiovisual formats for presenting useful and clear info is a positive aspect.The assignment calculator can help students in stablishing a timetable and following the steps in their research projects.The specific info about searching materials in the University at Buffalo Libraries is perhaps the less transferable section for other students, anyway it could be similar to other searching engines in other catalogues.I would recommend the site for students in their early stage of graduate/postgraduate studies. This material covers basic aspects for developing good assignments. ",4
171,"I spent the better part of an hour reviewing this site for use with college freshmen during their research paper unit. I was very impressed with its organization and layout:  it would be very easy for students to navigate through the site, finding the particular topics they wanted.  There are illustrations and links that help make the material readable and provide opportunity for students to try out the sources referred to.  The material is very basic:  any student could understand what is being presented.  Unfortunately, the links on this site to scholarly databases are (necessarily) proprietary.  Therefore, students at other colleges will be unable to access from this site the kind of authoritative, scholarly material most teachers prefer they use for their research papers.  The value of this site is thus limited for students at large.Technical Remarks: At one point the link is provided to a site called www.researchpaper.com.  I was concerned lest this be one of those ready-made sites freshmen are so fond of, that provide topics with pre-selected quotes and sources they can use in their paper without searching for them themselves.  I couldn't get the link to work, though; nor could I access this site by typing in the URL given, so I still don't know what kind of site this is.",4
172,The animatiion learning object is no longer available.,5
172,"Although there are a few broken links, I found this material to be rather useful and entertaining.",4
172,Very informative and interesting for students who are learing about learning styles.,5
172,"There is quite of reading. From a student point-of-view, I doubt you will keep someone's attention. I believe this may be a graduate-level tool for a Psychology class. I would prefer to see more animation and/or more interaction.Technical Remarks:Left and Right Brain Inventories link is broken.",3
172,"This site offered self-assessment tools that can be used to characterize right and left brain functionality.  The learning style sites that were used were useful, interactive and offered different styles of self-reflection.  Although the sites did not go into too much scientific research in terms of the different learning styles, they did offer a brief introductory glimpse into the different styles and they were well organized.  The learning tools that are offered on this site can be used with a wide range of audiences, varying from undergraduate students to graduate students.  The materials offered on this site captured a nice visualization effect to the subject matter at hand.  I believe the materials offered on this site would be great introductory tools to learning assessment.Technical Remarks:The 'Right and Left Brain Inventories' link did not open.",4
172,"It appears the original intentions for usablity of this Web site meets the goals it was designed for and the intended audience. I think, it was designed with an intention to be ""over-simplified""  so as to lead students to resources like the Brain Dominance test and the Myers-Briggs preliminary quizzes and interpretations and to pique interest. I do not think it was the intention of the creators to make this a scientific resource, but one that can spark an interest for students about themselves, and to allow them to learn more about their learning  styles and preferences. Often,  this topic is something new college students have never really considered. I, like the author, teach an Academic Strategies course to first time college students, and the information they learn about their learning styles or preferences is often a real key to motivation and results in extending their approach to studiy habits. In this course, as in mine, the intention is not to provide an in-depth treamtment of understanding in detail of neuroscientific research and data. Taken from this viewpoint, and for the audiences intended this Web site is a great tool for new college students.Technical Remarks:I found all the links working except for one. It was certainly easy to navigate, and not a busy looking site--defintely desgined for both the right and the left brains out there!",4
172,"I would have to agree that this is more pop psychology than a science. The lack of testing procedures was disappointing. The site boosted more than it actually produced. I was intrigued by the title and fascinated by the theories, but disillusioned by the content. 
It was fun to review as a one time visit, but for elaborate and informational purposes; I would suggest that the site be updated by some means of testing or questionnaire.",2
172,"Right brain, left brain theory is more pop psychology than science. Indeed, the utility of identifying learning styles is questionable at best.",1
172,"This resource promises more than it delivers.  Two of the links were broken and of the links that worked did not work well and one would require a person to purchase a test.This may have been a good site at one time, but it needs updating.",2
173,Wonderful animations for new acoustic students.  First section great for CSD students.  Would love more hemholtz and tube resonators!,4
173,"This site is geered to people with a serious interest in sound waves. It did not appeal to me as much,but the information was good. And I believe in the arena in which it is used its won a lot of acclaim.I did bounce around the site for awhile.Technical Remarks:Visually, the site was not as colorful as I imagined it might be. The information is extensive and well laid-out. I did however like the Rayleigh surface wave visual the best, very realistic looking.",4
173,"This is a well organized site with animations that were relatively rare at the time of the site's first publication (c. 1999). However, I currently favor similar resources that include interactive components (e.g. http://www.walter-fendt.de/ph14e/).Technical Remarks:Although the site's content and links are verified and updated regularly, the interface has not changed since the site's creation and could use an overhaul.",4
173,I love this site. Bravo. The animations are perfectly congruent to the content. ,4
173,This site is an okay site.Technical Remarks: i spent about 5 minutes browsing this site.  it is okay but i didn't find it too interesting.  i think it is easy to follow but it assumes that you know too much.  ,3
174,This is an excellent course to use for faculty development and discussion about teaching online.  It can be used in a course management system at your institution.  I used this with some of my colleagues and it engendered great discussion.,4
175,"My department will be offering a Business Ethics class in the fall. Reviewing this material - Business Ethics Cases 2 seems like an excellent fit as the cases have relevant topics. The students can definitely relate to all the challenges that the cases include, such as racism, vaccination, elections, COVID-19, social media, climate crisis, mass shootings, power of symbols, etc. These cases can definitively stimulate discussions in our in-person and online classes. We can even create debate teams to improve presentation skills, along with practicing written expressions.",5
175,"I have been utilizing these cases in my Managerial Ethics course and the students have really benefited from the cases. The ability to have this at my disposal is a great asset to me as the professor. The cases are pertinient to the times and are not dated. In addition, I have found the cases are increased engagement in the course room and provided higher levels of critical thinking among the students.",5
175,Business Ethics is almost a required course at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This site does provide valuable information to teachers of this course. I currently teach Business ethics and I found this to be very helpful.,4
176,"What is remarkable about this web site is the clarity of content.  This resource describes how cell membranes function with scientific accuracy but in simple language.  Although this web site  was written for middle school students, I will use it with my college non-major Biology students to supplement the textbook description of osmosis and diffusion.  This is a fun site to investigate - the facts are interesting!!!! ",5
176,"This is a great website that shows organelles of a cell and their functions. The website has a ""Organelle Review"" page which directs you to a page with links to all the organelles which gives all the functions of each organelles. The graphichs are not too great for the organelle but I think students will get the idea.",4
177,"This cite provides special education teaching cases aligned with CEC competency standards that can be used in classes or professional development. The website offers a number of ways to search for cases by topic, competency or alphabetical. I plan to use these materials this spring.",4
177,"Clearning house for Special Education materials. The case studies would be helpful for specific discussions around special education and learner experiences (pseudonyms used).Technical Remarks:Only written material--samples of students writing, for example, would enrich the posting.",4
178,"Seems to be a valuable site for information on Ewe Astia style drumming. Very informative regarding each drum and it's purpose. Links to videos. While the coding of the site is somewhat dated, the information is very valuable.",4
179,I am including the link in my Accounting II course. The material is an excellent review of many topics they were exposed to in the first Principles course.,5
179,"I wish I had found this site when teaching Accounting. I did forward this on to the Dean. What a great interactive site, I love how if the answer is incorrect, the rationale is given why the answer is incorrect.Technical Remarks:Easy to use, so much information.",5
179,Wow!  I am glad I found this to help with online instruction.  I posted it to my Course Documents immediately and the students love it.  Thanks for sharing such a good resource for Principles students,5
180,THis site offers information on many different things. The site offers information that will help enhance the faculties teaching and students' learning.Technical Remarks: THis site was easy to use and understand,4
180,"This is one of the first sites I have students in my teaching methods courses investigate. Because we are focusing on special education, I first have the students look at the ""Special Education Center"" section. The information and materials that are available there are quite comprehensive - everything from behavior management techniques to professional organizations. I particularly like the curriculum emphasis that is inherent throughout the site.",4
181,"These are ready-to-use ELS lesson. There are many excellent lessons to practise different language skills, reading, listening and speaking.
Lesson about reporting news with pre-listening or pre--reading activities.
After listening activities, fil-in-the gap, for example, students can do discussion, or other speaking excercise.
Homework is inclided at the end folowed by answers key.Technical Remarks:The lesson are user-friendly.Instructions are clear and easy to folow.",4
182,This appeared to be a very basic site for ESL students or students with skills below the 6th grade leve.Technical Remarks: It was easy to use and to navigate.,3
182,"I spent quite a bit of time reviewing the plethora of lessons and worksheets available on this site.  I have printed some of them and used them in my classroom.  The activities and worksheets are straightforward and the students seemed to grasp all of the lesson objectives. I found the lessons to be educationally significant, as many of them fit the goals I have set for my students.  I found that the website did enhance my teaching because it gives the students something new, rather than my personal teacher generated materials that they are used to.Technical Remarks:I believe first time users will find this easy to use.  I would not consider myself to be advanced when it comes to technology and navigating around websites, and I found this website to be user friendly and easy to use.",4
182,"I enjoyed reviewing this site for my ESL community college students.  I think the adjective clause word sorting will be fun for students learning how to combine sentences, and I think the spelling tests will be a fun exercise for my spelling class.  Technical Remarks: Technology appears to be fairly user friendly.",3
182,"I spent quite a bit of time going through both the student section and the ""teacher zone."" From what I saw, the material presented was accurate and educational. However, there was much of the site I could not access because I did not pay the fee to join the site. This alone put me off because it seems that this site is student focused and yet most students would not, and should not have to, pay a fee. I'm not even sure it would be worth paying the fee as much of the site could not be explored unless I was to pay. Also I found that at first glance this site was both overwhelming and yet boring. There are many links to choose from but that is all that is offered to the browser-- links. The information presented is done so in a non-entertaining way and therefore, if I were a student, I would not be able to stay on this site for more than 5 or 10 minutes.",3
183,The site offers a fair number of activities. The challenge is that you have a lot of links out to materials so it can be time consuming to use to put together a complete assignment.,3
183,"Content clearly offers activities that align to core subjects taught to elementary aged children yet introduces students to business ownership. I would suggest learning objectives for each section of activities. I would also suggest that students are challenged to think through their buying decisions as a part of the activities. For example, challenge students to explain why, when, how and where they make their purchases whereby you would tie the responses into the Decision Making / Communications Skills section. …Very good selection of activities for engaging children in career development and entrepreneurship.Technical Remarks:Engaging technology such as online games and including documentaries about youth entrepreneurs to deliver several of the activities would be also be recommended.",4
183,"This activity contains some great introduction to types of business ventures.  Consider discussing licensing, and management agreements.  Create learning objectives. Narrow your scope or add resources for different types of ventures so they can be consistently covered.Technical Remarks:Use high resolution graphics.",4
183,"This resource provides basic information for individuals seeking to start or grow a small business. While the site provides good information, including teaching tools and resources, it is not interactive or engaging.Technical Remarks:This website requires only basic online navigational skills.",3
184,"This resource is quite useful and has a lot of interesting material in it.
The assesment and evaluation of web pages and internet resources is very important and not very useful to develop. this site can serve us as a point of departure, giving us many ideas about how to do it.",4
185,"A very useful introduction to Second Life, can be used at the beginning of a workshop or sent as a link to anyone who asks about SL and possible educational uses. 

The slides consist of still pictures accompanied by voice-over. The narrator explains what Second Life is, and goes over possible educational uses, showing still shots of how others have used SL for such purposes. It might have been more interesting to include video clips of SL in action as well. The examples given encompass a range of disciplines and seems quite comprehensive. Some universities already on SL are also mentioned, which can be useful for those new to SL who want to get experience from other campuses.

It does not delve into deeper implications but is a good intro.

*Two small areas of improvement:
- Has outdated information about SL still working on voice communication - this exists now.
- The narrator talks about an upcoming presentation with further information on SL. It would have been useful to have a link for the archive of that presentation (seems it was in 2007).Technical Remarks:Even though i was on a high-speed connection, sometimes the presentation would stop (probably while chaching). It helped to press the ""pause"" button for a while.

Also, if you're in a hurry: there are a few seconds of silence at the end of each slide - you can watch a bit faster by clicking the ""next"" arrow as soon as narrator stops talking, and a few secs before the slide transitions.",4
186,"I spent about 15-20 minutes looking at diffrent things on this site. Some of the games are complicated, and some of them are cute and amusing. It has a lot of really unique Java games, that make the site overall more interesting. This could be easily used to enhance teaching in the class room, since its making math more interesting. This site was very easy to use.",4
186,This site was pretty interesting.  Once inside I found myself browsing around continously from one category to another.  Great information.  If able to spend some more time I believe the info can be quite useful,3
186,"This web sit was awsome.  I really enjoye the ey opener activity, and by doing the activity it made me want to learn more.  So by doing so I searched this web sit until there was no more to search, and I enjoyed ever bit of it.  It was very easy to follow, and at the same time the web sit was very educational.  The acitity right in the front of the web page was what got my attention, and that is one reason why I rated it a 5.  Well I really enjoyed this sit.",5
186,This site has a large collection of good quality Java applets that illustrate and help to solve or prove various math problems in many different areas of mathematics. Technical Remarks: Very professional design.,5
187,"This website provides a wide range of virtual labs, simulations, and animations for general chemistry.  It's free!  I found the content accurate.

Many of the virutal labs are great for students to get a feel of what titration is all about without having to physically perform the experiment.

Students need between some math (but these activities are not math intensive)  There is graphical support included in the text to make it more usable for English Learners.  The reading demands are at or below high school levels.Technical Remarks:The websites works on both MAC's and PC's.",4
188,This is a great source for learning how to use primary sources and why they are important. The fact that it is keyword searchable and advanced searchable by category makes it even more useful.,5
188,"Excellent resource that provides easy access to primary documents. Also, the search function makes finding quality websites pertaining to a particular topic quick and easy.",5
189,"The exercises are a great assessment tool for the classroom but there was no follow-up to determining whether or not the sites were objective, authoritative, etc.  There was nothing in the materials to help improve my teaching other than providing the exercises themselves.",3
189,"Nicely organized web page containing evaluation practice and exercises. Includes core evaluation criteria for undergraduate students. Problem-based evaluation skills are clearly and concisely defined, the page is easy to use, and all links were active.",4
189,"Since this page contains links to both bogus and authentic websites and a lesson plan encouraging students to work in small groups, it is a high-quality time-saving device for those of us teaching information literacy. The links have been collected for you. All the teacher has to do is direct students to this page in class and follow the plan. At the time of this writing, all links were up-to-date, which is much appreciated.",5
189,Some interesting resources to support classroom discussions.,3
190,A great site full of rich information.  Easy to find information.  I looked through some of the algebra pages and found them to be informative and useful.  ,4
190,"Looking over this material was a little bit overwhelming because i didn't know where to start but,it would be easier if I knew what I was looking for.I looked it over for about 20mins and got dizzy.The content was overall easy to look for because everything was in alphabetical order.Teaching would be a little bit harder because I'm not good at math myself,if there was someone who wanted to learn more about it.It would probably be much better for them.It was easy to learn because there were steps by steps for you to follow.It was easy to use some of them, if you knew atlest some of the material.",4
190,"Interactive Mathematics--Arithmetic/Algebra is one of the helpful link I found on this website, particularly the ""fast Arithmetic Tips"" mental calculations. The examples and explanation really helps me improve my math. I will forward this link to my son so he can review and study math using this link.",5
190,"1. I reviewed the material by trying out some of the games and puzzles applets the site had to offer. For example, I played a game called “A Game With Coins” which I ended up winning multiple times. I spent about a half an hour running through different applets.  

2. The quality of content on http://www.cut-the-knot.org/ is very good. All of the games and puzzles accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant by allowing the student to try problems hands on through the use of java applets. These java applets indicate whether you win or lose and each applet is accompanied by discussions and explanations of the math involved in trying to solve the problem.

3. Cut the knot dot org has tremendous potential for learning and enhancing teaching by providing a plethora of material in the area of arithmetic and algebra to discuss and assign to students for homework and in class discussion. 

4. For me, using the materials presented to me was very easy. The site mainly uses java applets to illustrate a math game or puzzle which work in conjunction with an internet browser. Most browsers are enabled to do this and if not the browser directs you to Sun’s website where you can download the appropriate software which is very easy to do. Chances are, if you are on the internet browsing sites, you have java installed and enabled to work with your browser.Technical Remarks:See #4 above",4
190,"I looked at several Interactive Tools that this page provided, some of them are the java interactive games such as #60 ""Flipping Pancakes"" or # 23 "" Breaking Chocolate"" as well as # 1 ""3 Glasses"" I tried those 3 interactive items out and found them quite mind boggling and interesting since it took me a while to get what the website wanted right. This website is very easy to understand and can definately be used as a teaching tool in a math class for students that have very bad math skills. ",5
191,Awesome website! Great tutorials for all subjects.,4
191,"I absolutely love this website.  It is suitable for students of all ages since it covers everything from basic math to calculus.  I also really like that it had test prep (eg SAT).  The mode of instruction is great for visual and audio learners, as he talks through every step he is writing.",5
191,"Awesome!  This site is a great help to everyone because we all struggle with one concept or another... well, everyone except Khan :)  Thanks for posting this site.  I plan to use it in the near future.",5
191,"This is GREAT! I think students who are visual learners like myself could really beneift from this website. I liked that it provides help for multiple subjects, including science.",5
192,"What a great idea! Make your own site where others can help. It's attractive, and I love that it has sounds to everything.quality of content - 5potential effectiveness - 5ease of use - 5Technical Remarks:No problems noticed.",5

I strongly recommend it.",4
192,"I think this site is good for people who want to not only learn French but other languages as well. It helps with the everyday things that one must learn to communicate;from family names,verbs,numbers,colors, and home furniture; the list continues. ",5
193,"This is an open journal article published by MERLOT's Journal of Online Learning and Teaching in June 2008 (Vol. 4, No. 2). The paper presents an ambitious vision. I would enjoy elaboration on the components of the education management system offered within this vision and a clear connection betwee each component and its roots in the literature. I think the article's greatest potential use, particularly given the 3.5 years since its publication, would be in stimulating discussions or creating projects centered on the suggested components of the education management system. I do plan to consider how some of the concepts and components listed in the article align with my own research interests related to instructional design and threaded discussions.",4
194,This is pretty good re: what not to do with PowerPoint.  I will be using it during our class discussion on my students' final presentations.,4
194,It's really funny! Will certainly keep students entertained while covering the most common powerpoint gaffes.,4
194,Great short video on what not to do on powerpoints,4
195,"This is an intro to literary investigation, but it has almost nothing to do with Glaspell's text. There's the risk of providing too many brief mentions of other texts which students won't really understand if they've not read those texts for themselves which is disappointing because Glaspell's text could be used to show all of these basic literary elements. This is most like the basic overview chapter from an intro to lit course. ",2
195,"Although this site promises to explore literary elements in the short story ""A Jury of Her Peers,"" it doesn't really deliver on that.  It does present basic information for novices about plot, character, setting, etc.  However, very little of the discussion of these topics includes reference to Glaspell's story.Technical Remarks:Asks questions but provides no feedback to answers.  One link says ""see what others have said"" but there is nothing there.",2
195,"I spent two days searching for a potential site that could involve both the teacher and the student and I believe this site fulfills the above requirements.  Students are able to read a short story over the internet and once the story has been read students review the elements of a ""good"" short story.  These elements are covered in aspects like plot, point of view, characterization, setting and theme.  The above elements are re-examined through examples from the text and activities such as: student comments, questions and answers, and developing scenes.  Technical Remarks: This site is helpful for the teacher as an initial introduction to students about the elements of a short story and how to asses and possibly write their own short story.  This site is also beneficial to students because it is an interactive site that has activities that may enhance the understanding of a ""good"" short story before the students enter the classroom the next day.  It is a good introduction about elements to short stories that can later be re-emphasized by the teacher in future lesson plans.  This site could be continually used by teachers if the present short story changes periodically so students can adapt to on-line learning and use this site more than once as a reference to short story analysis and writing.",4
196,"I played around with some of the tools for 45 minutes and it was fun. The collection is pretty good and I like that fact that I can do or verify my answers without using a calculator. Instructions and examples are very useful. (I actually read the how-to section before I could get one of the tool to work, shame on me!!). I think this set of tools will be useful for students but for complex math problem, you still need a calculator. (Otherwise Texas Instrument would be worried about going out of calculator business). Some tools could be improved to show points/co-ordinates/values on the graph while one moves the line/points instead of on the side.",4
196,"While I did not spend an excessive amount of time on this site, that is only because I came to realize it's usefulness very quickly. This is exactly the type of site that is perfect for someone such as myself, who doesn't have the money to splurge on a nice, bells-and-whistles packing, calculator. And it saves plenty of paperwork. I would say that this site is a wonderful addition to the students' bag of tricks and, while I wouldn't recommend it to persons who have yet to fully understand many of the aspects of graphing, it is a wonderful tool for those of us short on time.",5
196,"I spent about one hour and a half looking at different applet topics within the site. I would like to use some of the applets for student activities in my Precalculus classes. Some of them are very excellent for familiarizing the student with very important Precalculus and Calculus concepts. The material is excellent, and I believe will be a great addition to my classes. The students will benefit from them. Many of the applets illustrate concepts in a way superior to the standard graphing calculators.I did find some material a little difficult to use. The fact that the site presents built-in examples, is of great help. Technical Remarks: It would be great to have applets for conic sections where the students can ""dial"" the parameters of the standard equations:(x-h)^2/a^2 + (y-k)^2/b^2 = 1, (x-h)^2/a^2-(y-k)^2/b^2=1, x^2=4py, etcand see how the parameters of the expanded equation: Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2.... change.The author has accomplished a much more difficult task in the existent conics applet, so I guess it will not be a major challenge for him. It would be very nice to have something like that for Precalculus students, so they can make the connection between both expressions and relate to the characteristics of the generated graph",5
197,"I spent a solid 25-30 minutes browsing through the material on ""Maths Online"" and using their many interactive JAVA applets. I also downloaded the software version of the material to my computer.
I chose this site because of the interactivity. Who doesn't love to push buttons and see things move and shift in real time? From graphs, to quadratic equations to set theory, the material of Maths Online is pretty useful for multiple levels of students. 
The strong points of this site are the applets and their ease of use and understanding. The ability to input your answers or ideas into a live application has the potential to enhace learning on many levels. Many applets offer practice questions that allow you to check your answers, further showing steps to reach solutions. Some are quite useful, others are irrelevant to education, such as the ""warp image"" applet. Interesting, but not very educationally significant. 
I recommend it, with four stars!",4
197,"I spent about a half hour on this page exploring the different types of math it described and explained. I'll admit, the use of the word maths(plural) caught my attention and let me know that most likely it was a foreign made website and thus perhaps could introduce a new and different perspective than I was used to. I spent most of my time inputting data on the Gauss distribution. I found it to be pretty helpful considering that particular concept was new to me. I think it would be pretty easy to use this website to explore new math concepts. There is; however, several grammerical errors that slightly bugged me, but after all it isn't an English teaching website.",3
197,"I didn't click through the sponsored links on this page but i browsed through the links on the page referring to testing, help, and math aid for high school students. I would recommend this website for high school students or college students in lower math classes because it gives applications and web links to different aspects of high school math that kids tend to struggle with. It also offers self tests in multiple choice questions and application problems to aid in tutorials outside of class and homework. I this it is simple enough to be generally user friendly and very helpful for those kids who struggle in some of the basic concepts in algebra, trig., calculus and everything in between.",4
198,"From the introduction, I expected to find some structures in relation to discovery for research writing.  What I experienced was rhetoric on a process that did not come to fruition.  I clicked on a couple of the links but was disappointed when they did not yield any additional information.Technical Remarks:Too vague so I will not revisit this site even if it is updated periodically.",1
199,"This is a great resource for ""Introductory Microbiology"". There isa  variety of images, videos and animations that can supplement the learning process in class as well as lab. I will be using selected links as a supplemental resource for students. ",5
199,Great website to use photos and information to put together an unknown bacteria lab,4
199,Excellent resource for Introduction to Microbiology.,5
199,Users of this site can access and download a variety of resources for classroom presentations and activities related to microbiology. The materials that are available are peer reviewed and the site continues to grow as more contributions are solicited and reviewed. There is a search function that assists in finding appropriate materials.,5
200,To some extent drills are useful in learning and reviewing material.  This activity suits that purpose fairly well and presents the material in a different way (the question becomes the answer).  I may include this in my online course as a self-review exercise.Technical Remarks:It would be useful to develop a technically more complex program that would allow students to click on one or several hints if they did not respond correctly the first time.,3
200,This would be very useful as a follow up to instruction to help students know what they already understand and what needs to be reviewed.  It may also be useful as a pretest to help students see what they don't know and to create questions in their minds to be answered during class.  I think it would be great to use together with perhaps a matching or similar exercise.,4
200,"Very well done quiz with answers. Makes a great self-assessment tool for students. I did not use this in the classroom, but I did take the idea and made flash cards that are similar for my online nursing research class.",4
201,"This site offers students additional help with science and mathematics. Most of the topics are covered in High School, not making it super helpful for an Elementary School teacher.",3
201,These videos are great for all teachers.  So many videos are geared towards English/History teachers and it's great to see some good materials for science and math teachers.  I'll be using this in my generic methods class.,4
201,"When I came across the material, I spent about an hour watching the videos and reading the steps to becoming an effective teacher. The quality of the content presents teaching methods that are significant to those who plan on being teachers. Although the material focuses on mathematics and science, even those who want to teach in other areas have advantages while watching the videos. The videos present a foundation that I feel beginning teachers should follow. As a student who is working towards a degree in education, I found the material very effective for students as well. As a student, I learned that reflecting on what I learn each day is a great way to absorb new knowledge. For everyone that takes the time to review this material will find it easy to work and extremely useful.",4

202,"With the author's permission, I altered the format of the content and used them to guide a workshop on plagiarism for writing tutors (higher ed.). After leading a brief discussion of what plagiarism is, I passed out a sheet containing the source passage and student's passage to 5 small groups (one type per group). Each group discussed whether there was plagiarism present and why. Then I provided each group with a debrief sheet that showed all of the content for that plagiarism type from the website. They then discussed whether they agreed with the author's name, description, and examples of that plagiarism type. We then came together and each group described the type they were given. It was a hit!",5
202,"This resource is easy to use because it is simply text on a page. It would be readily adaptable into any composition courses because it thoroughly identifies the many different types of plagiarism. On one hand, I would like the information to be delivered in a more interactive format, but the simple presentation is one of the benefits of this source.",4
202,"I came across this guide while taking my undergraduate physics courses. There’s something wrong with that. I should have come across it while taking my English courses (including elementary school)!  The types and descriptions of plagiarisms and each one’s supporting examples provide the basic idea on how to properly write a reference paper. But of course, plagiarism isn’t just limited to written papers. Plagiarism is too easy to do, just as the author explains from the onset in this uniquely valuable tool. After reading and understanding the different types of examples, the reader should feel empowered to think and communicate, while referencing other’s work, their own ideas effectively and without reproach. Something everyone, despite their background, should be able to do.",5
202,"Plagiarism can be difficult for most entering college students to understand. They seem not to understand the different ways in which plagiarism can occur. This resource does an excellent job of providing examples that are very clear and detailed. This resource would make an excellent addition to the materials I use when discussing plagiarism with my research writing classes.Technical Remarks:If it would not overload the resource, I would add a section on the differences between quoting, summarizing, and paraphrasing.",4
202,"I appreciate the layout - original text to the left and example of plagiarism type to the right. Although, I'd suggest a topic more conducive to quick review. I fear students won't take the time to thoroughly read each in order to recognize subtle differences.Technical Remarks:i would avoid color to denote differences. Not always easy to see.",3
202,Many resources for dealing with plagiarism provide the same kinds of perspectives and information.  This resource provides clear examples of plagiaristic behavior that I don't generally see in other resources.  It's a good addition to the materials I use in my classes to assist students through this challenging area.,4
202,"As an administrator and teacher of a homeschool co-op of 120 students who meet weekly, I have found this article to be extremely helpful in the classroom.  Our co-op stresses academic excellence and college prep. classes, and this handout explains the various types of plagiarism in a well organized and easy to read format.  The author's examples clearly illustrate both a plagiarized text as well as a properly written paraphrase.  We have contacted her for permission to utilize it in all of our upper middle and high school classes next year!Technical Remarks:Although the subject matter in this paper is about science, it can be easily used in any upper level academic class.  It is particularly helpful to any class that requires a research paper during the semester!",5
202,"Quality of content

This material is great for introducing Plagiarism to first year students who may have heard about it but unclear about what it really means in terms of being penalised by their tutors. The Content is core curriculum but is a pre-requisite for advanced level studies in every discipline.

Potential effectiveness as a T&L tool

I would use this material as a source for active reading. Then I would use it when students learn to develop summarising, paraphrasing and referencing skills and check whether they are avoiding plagiarism. Since I teach a diverse group of students with diverse backgrounds, needs and expectations, it is important that the topic of plagiarism is introduced and practised with good and relevant examples.Technical Remarks:Although the topic is crucial for academic success, I wouldn't use Red in the title or in the body of the text as it could be an issue for students who are colour blind or who have special learning needs.",3
202,"This material serves well as a mini-lesson on plagiarism.  As indicated, students often do not understand the concept, especially with the use of internet where all material is consided ""fair game"" when writing.Technical Remarks:I would prefer to see this information constructed on a Powerpoint so that students focus on one example at a time. In addition, the instructor could incorporate a learning activity that challenges students to validate their own resources.",4
202,"This article clearly defines what is and is not plagiarism. Since plagiarism is an extremely important part of the education system, this article helps students and educators understand what is plagiarism and how to avoid it.",4

204,"This is a great website for ESL/EFL students to practice their listening after class. The listening materials are well organized based on level of difficulty and different themes, which allow students to choose the listening materials that they find interesting and appropriate for their level. This website also has video files which are shot in real-life settings. Students prefer this kind of authentic listening materials and they love to learn what they can directly apply in real-life situations. Audio and video files at this website are not downloadable so one needs to connect to the Internet in order to use these materials. Therefore, it's better to use this as additional listening practice materials for students after class.",4
204,As an ELS teacher I am always looking for authentic uses of English for my students to listen to. The great thing about Randall's ELS lab is that it has a huge collection of just such audio. It would impossible for my students to get enough listening time from just me.  Randall's gives me a resource to send my student to get supplemental listening practice with a great set of built in evaluation tools. Lessons are clearly cataloged by content and difficulty level making it easy to find appropriate lessons. It's a great website and one I will be using a lot in the future.   ,4
204,Easy to challenging short essays for ESL learners. It allows them to self check and work at a self-faced rate.,4
204,"Randall's ESL Cyber Listening Lab is one of the better sites I have come across for listening practice for ESL/EFL learners. The wide variety of skill levels and cultural topics provide fertile ground for any number of learning assignments, whether instructor-led in the classroom or as autonomous student practice.

The single (and minor) negative point of using this site--as one commenter has already mentioned--is the somewhat distracting nature of the Google ads on each page. In particular, these interrupt the physical ""flow"" of individual activity pages; for example, there are ads that separate pre-listening and listening exercises, which may confuse lower level learners or even more advanced learners not overly familiar with the physical layout of web pages.Technical Remarks:While I have not yet used the ""Long Conversations with RealVideo,"" there could conceivably be a problem with in-class use of these with numerous students attempting simultaneous downloads in a language lab with lower connection speeds.",5
204,"What I like is the structure of the activity. Thhis is attask-based activity.with pre-listening, listening and post-listening excercises.Each activity has topic, level of difficulty, what type of activity (conversation ,etc),the length of listening passage.
At the end of the listening portion you can check your multiplechoice answers promptly and receive imediate feedback.Technical Remarks:It is very user-friendly.",5
204,"Overall rating: 5 out of 5Randall's ESL Cyber Listening Lab an interactive website free to students and teachers of English as a Second or Foreign language. This site is designed to help ESL/EFL students improve their English listening comprehension skills through practice with self-grading quiz pages. This site is also appropriate to all age levels. This is a good site for teacher to use as teaching resource and for students to use as independent study. This is an effective teaching-learning tool. The site has hundreds of free interactive lessons for self-study or classroom use. The amount of and the depth of material is adequate. Materials include quizzes, games, and exercises for practicing reading, writing, and listening skills at the beginning through advanced levels. This site adheres to a clear organizing principle, in which listening activities are categorized by topic, proficient level, academic purpose, and the length of audio. Each listening activity includes audio, script, quiz, pre-listening exercises and post-listing exercises. The variety of listening activity is wide, which is from daily uses to academic purpose. Overall, this site is excellent except one concern. There are too many advertisements on each page. The advertisement blocks are beside to this sites navigation blocks. This is not easy to tell which one is internal page link, and which one is external advertisement link. This might be annoying.Technical Remarks:Overall rating: 5 out of 5The quality of audio is excellent. The author provides two audio formats (Real Player and Windows Media Player), which allows many users to use the audio. In addition, script is provided in each activity,
 which helps students to read and listen to the content simultaneously. Moreover, activities are organized by subjects, which is easy to navigate. Finally, quiz has interactive feedbacks, which could increase learners interests and motivation. Overall, this site is easy to use.",5
204,"As I am a non-native speaker of English, I enjoyed listening to conversations in thismaterial and found this site excellent.  Being in a foreign country it is hard to encounter English speakers to communicate with.  According tostudents in Japan they need to go to a private English school to improve their listening skills because of a lack of listening materials and less opportunities to communicate with English speakers in Japan.  Normally the tuition at the English school is really expensive, more than academic at schools.  As far as I know, thetuition cost is over $170 for eight hours forgroup lessons and private lessons cost twice as much and its lessons are usually less than five hours.  In addition at academic schools usually there is only a native speaker and the native speaker speak in Japanese to students rather than in English.  Therefore students need to findmaterials for their self-study.  This site is suitable for not only self-study but also group study.  The students can exchange information about conversations in the group.  As long as learners have access to use a computer, this site is free to use and computer skill is notrequired.  This site is appropriate for anylearners even though their listening skill is tremendous or considerable.  In the end, Istrongly recommend this site for international students or learners who need to take TOEFL or TOEIC exam because the conversation in this material is basic for listening skill andquestions are similar to the questions on these exams.  I encourage learners to visit this site and find interests.Technical Remarks:This site includes listening quizzes, textcompletion quizzes, script of quizzes, and post listening exercises.  On the first screen, there are many listening topics that learners canchoose.  The topics are separated into colloquial and academics listening activities.  After they choose a topic for their needs, they are able to know how long the conversation will take place, and the number and gender of speakers.  The speech is recorded very clearly.  There is no noise and speakers don?t have strong accents so that learners can easily focus on the pronunciation of the speakers.  The varieties of levels help learners to choose the best for their skill.  When they answer questions they just need to click a circle to select their answer.  I would like to encourage many learners to use this site to challenge their English listening skills and prepare themselves to able to communicate with native speakers of English.",5
204,"I spent a significant portion of time reviewing this site. I like the concept of this site when I first it and decided to look to whole site over and participate with it as if I were a student. I selected one exercise from each category in each section. By doing this I developed a basic understanding of why these exercises were grouped the way that they were. I found the exercises to be broad their overall scope and that they covered many pertinent topics of interest and use to early ESL students. The quality of content in these lessons is high, although, I feel that the exams at the end of the presentations could be more extensive. Perhaps more such exams could be offered in the future and I would suggest that this be done to upgrade this site and keep it in the high-ranking category that it currently occupies. I found that this site is easy to use and promotes user interaction by maintaining a high quality of audio reproduction. Furthermore, the audio files downloaded quickly and I found that that feature also promoted continued user interaction by avoiding the frustration that comes from using poor or slow materials. Maintaining this feature is particularly important in keeping first time users interested in continuing with these exercises. The potential for enhancing teaching effectiveness and learning by using these tools could be dramatic. I do not know that this is true, as I have not yet tried this in a classroom. But, given the breadth and depth of these fine materials, I believe that they will be quite impactful and I conclude that this site should be maintained and expanded in order truly fulfill its full potential.John T. RhoeTechnical Remarks: The primary difference between the difficulty levels seems to be a matter of syntactical complexity and the amount of inference required on the part of the listener to answer the exam questions. A possible expansion of this site could include complex pictures coupled with the spoken text and exam questions that required the listener to draw form both as he/she answers the exam. I can also see this program would benefit from having long sections of text available for the listener to read as he/she listens to the sound of it. As I progressed through the exercises, with an eye on this program as a teacher, I felt that the program would be more readily incorporated into various curricula by the addition of a text or lesson book that these listening exercises would then augment.Still, I found this site to be an excellent resource.John T. Rhoe",5
205,"There are some great activities in this site.  Unfortunately, it's flash-based so it doesn't work on my iPad, but I use it with my math methods students.  I particularly like More or Less Estimator and A Better Fire.  They both help students with estimating number and percentrage.",4

206,"I liked the author/designer's concept of incorporating visuals of real people, written and spoken target language, and student interactivity with the material to reinforce and expand a students'knowledge of the various topics presented in the modules.Technical Remarks: When I examined this site on October 18, 2004, some of the links did not work.  I did notice that the site was copyrighted 1997 and I do not know when it was last updated.  If the site is updated, the combination of visual images, audio, and student interactivity with the material should appeal to learners of various learning styles. I think that once students have been through one of the modules in a computer lab or the like with their instructor or teacher, they will have a better understanding on how the modules work and they could complete them individually.   Because of the variety of technology incorporated, users should access the site with a broadband connection.",4

210,"Fidel Calvillo:  An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only positive divisors (factors) are one and itself.  For example, the prime divisors of 10 are 2 and 5; and the first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic shows that the primes are the building blocks of the positive integers: every positive integer is a product of prime numbers in one and only one way, except for the order of the factors. This is great information in regards to what prime  numbers are, i my self would really recommend this site for use to see what prime numbers are. I can trully understand what they are talking about in detail and step by step in what the largest prime numbers are.",4
210,"I think this website has a lot of good and interesting information.  The first page gives an overview of different examples of large primes that could be understood by a general audience while many of the links provide more detailed and rigorous explanations.  I think, however, with all the links that it is easy to get lost on this website.  Also, although this is a fun and informative resource about primes, I'm not sure how one could incorporate this into the classroom environment.",4
210,"Using this website will definetly help you in understanding the subject you are learning. At first using this website it takes a coupple of minutes to navigate through, but once you are comfortable with it then the learning begins.

The website is very mathmaticaly friendly. you do not need to know the material before looking at it, the website explains everything.",4
210,"Now I have a good general understanding of what primes are. I was scrolling down the page then I saw the title ""The Prime Page"", so I clicked on it. I always hear math teachers talk about primes and now, like I said above I have a better understanding of what they are. I read through the website and even clicked on a couple of the links that it had on there. I checked out all of the examples that were on there and saw the top ten record primes with so many numbers behind them it was mind boggling. This site is a good one for people who are learning about prime numbers because it tells you what they are and then goes into greater detail on them. the part that I liked the most was the links for the onehundred largest known primes and the largest known prime of the year. this software was not hard at all to use, all you got to do is follow the directions and find an article that is interesting to you.",5
210,"After going through all of the information on this particular website I found that it took me about twenty minutes to just go through all of the important information.  After reading through all of the important details to this website I would go back and write down some examples that were given about a prime number and all of the solutions that are there in a prime number.  A really good thing that I found about this website was that it always gave a good definition about what a prime number really is, and what it is capable of doing through mathematics.     I also found that the quality of the work and information was very useful to me because now I have a full understanding of what a prime number is and what it can do for basic math.  I honestly thought that the concepts that were displayed in the website were very meaningful and easy to understand.  It was fun to know that there are websites that display great information of what a person is trying to understand and follow.     I strongly believe that if all students and other teachers go by what was being stated in the website that it will be fun to learn for both parties.  I think that learning will be enhanced because of the simple fact that there is so much information that can be found in this website about the prime number and other facts and details as well.  All of the infomation that was given to me in this website will always help me to understand what I am trying to accomplish for this particular subject in math.  I also believe that other math teachers should check this website out because it gives great examples and it shows great detail to everything about the prime numbers.     In closing I believe that first time users will find this technique easy to follow.  I think that
 first time users will have no problems finding this software because if you just follow the instructions there will be no problems at all.  I think that it will be easy for most first time usersbecause it only took me about five minutes to get started on finding the site and to start reviewing and going over all of the information in the website.  This information was fun to learn about and it will continue to help me in all my areas of mathematics.",5

The information presented is a great source for teachers teaching and students learning because the information is clearly explained with the right amount of detail where both students and teachers can relate.  This site has interesting information making the information easier to understand, especially with the many links to help guide the visitor through with greater insight. This site was very easy to navigate some might get a bit confused bouncing back and forth from each link but over all experienced users will have no problem at all.",4

This would make a good additional to our New Faculty orietation, especially those who come to the college without any education courses.",4
216,"This site has a wide range of resources about Bloom's. (Exposition, PPT Quiz, Worksheet. I liked it a lot, and would share it with faculty when I do workshops on assessment and course evaluation.",4
217,"This is a great interactive tool for learning how to read a food label. It is not in the format of the new nutrition facts panel that will be required beginning in July 26, 2018.",4
217,Great use of PowerPoint to construct a knowledge based lesson on the Nutrition Facts Label with interactive learning opportunities. The learner applies what they have learned through the quiz at the end. Will be helpful to update this lesson once the new food label is officially released or could update the lesson now with info on what the purported changes are,4
217,"PowerPoint presentation used to explain the nutrition label was well developed. Easy to read and understand. Explained fats and their relationship to disease, the different types of fat and where to find the different ingedrients on the label. (ie, proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins and minerals, etc..)This resource will be very useful to the consumer. There is an interactive quiz/lesson after the PowerPoint slides.",5
218,This looks like an excellent resource for teachers when doing lab experiments in the classroom as well as having students use the website to write their lab reports.  I especially like the tab reserved for teachers with links that give several suggestions on using the website and strategies for student lab write ups.,5
219,I don't always have time to use this in class at the end of Intro Stats but when I do (or sometimes when I assign it as homework) there are always students who LOVE it. The visual impact of seeing a variety of correlations coefficients in the side-by-side scatter plots is perfect for some students.,5
219,This is an easy to use and fun applet to help students visualize the pattern of a correlation between two variables. I think students will like the ability to compete against the world. This certainly could be incorporated into an online lecture to reinforce the concept around the strength and direction of a correlation.,4
219,"This is one of my favorite applets to use in class. I use this in the middle of the lecture, to break up the lecture a little. I have the students guess the values of coorelation as a group. They always find it fun to play a game in the middle of class!",4
219,"This tool has become a favorite in my Introduction to Educational Research course. Many of my students have complained that they find scatter plots confusing or even incomprehensible. When they use this tool, they normally compete with themselves, and many have reported not only their enjoyment, but also their increased understanding and decreased apprehension with this statistical application. It is definitely a winner.",5
219,"Very straight-forward and simple. The option of having students compete against each other is a nice touch, but instructors will need to set up their own group id via email in advance.Technical Remarks:As another reviewer pointed out - sometimes two correlations are very similar (such as .86 and .87). I think this could get frustrating for students.It would also be nice if a group id could be generated automatically instead of by emailing the material's creator.",4
219,"This is a great, simple tool to help students start to make the connection between the numerical value of a correlation and the picture in a scatterplot.  I like the suggestion in one of the peer reviews of also varying the sample size.",4
219,"This applet is a great way for students to practice identifying correlations visually. I incorporated it into an assignment where students had to ""play"" the game until they guessed 20 correctly. You can also set up your own competition among your students to see who can get the most correct in a row--it's very motivating!Technical Remarks:Sometimes the correlations between two or more plots are not distinguishable by eye: 0.25 is not much different from 0.27 and in those cases it can be frustrating to guess wrong. Otherwise it's great.",4
219,"One of my students brought this correlations quiz to my attention.  I used it in the classroom and had students pick their answers before reviewing the correct answers and the reasons for these answers.  From now on I will attempt to use this in my teaching of statistics in psychology.  

My student's direct words on this L.O. were: ""One concept I had trouble with in psychology was correlation. At first I was confused because the correlation can either be positive or negative; however, the sign does not represent strength. The sign just represents whether the correlation is inversely proportional or directly proportional. Also a correlation of -1 is stronger than a correlation of -.5. Normally a person would think -.5 is higher. This L.O. is a good tool because it gives the learner a visual. It is easier to picture the correlation by seeing a scatterplot. When the dots are closer together you know it is a correlation close to 1. If it is increasing it is positive and if it is decreasing it is negative. By looking at the different scatterplots and trying to guess the correlation the learner is able to grasp this concept better. The learner will be able to figure out which correlations are stronger much faster after using this L.O.""",4
219,I love it!,4
219,"Great practice with awkward interface. This applet appears outstanding at offering students practice in estimating correlations from scatterplots. A number of my own students tried it and found it to help in an area in which they were not confident of their own abilities. The challenge of its use is in working with the interface. It is difficult to get all of the parts of the applet that you need on the screen at once. We found it easier to use in Netscape if you used the """"options"""" to remove the toolbar, location, and directory buttons from view while using the applet and then scrolling down slightly so that the four graphs and four multiple choice options were all visible at once.",3
219,"Great way to make correlations visually clear; lots of fun. I didn't have as much trouble seeing the whole applet, probably because I have a 17"""" screen. Is it possible to use true radio buttons - i.e., only one can be selected at a time on a line? When I changed my """"vote"""" by clicking a second button on a row, the first remained selected. Even clicking again on the first choice didn't toggle it off. I had to start over to clear the multiple choices. But I plan to spend more time with this; it sharpens my eye for correlations.",4
220,This website can be used by teachers as a reference when preparing writing lesson. The website is well organized and it is easy to navigate. The information on the website is organized around important topics that are covered in writing classes. Students can also use this website as a source for self-study. ,4
220,"This is a remarkable online resource. Allows you to easily access information and download functional templates you can use right away. Can be a little complex, but for the beginning college research, it is indispensable.",5
220,I really enjoyed reviewing this writing resource material after I was referred to it by our University's writing assistance department.  I have since used it in my classroom and students have reported feedback that they found it very worthwhile as well.  Overall a great tool for anyone with writing questions from reference style to writing style support.,5
220,"I use this site repeatedly in freshman and sophomore level classes.  Students find it easy to navigate and the site has a myriad of materials helpful for students, from grammar handouts to writing research papers.Technical Remarks: Students have told me they like this site because it is not only helpful but also very easy to ""get around.""",5
220,"The site entitled OWL -Online Writing Lab is an amazing site of technical writing assistance to students and facility.  There is no requirement or prerequisite for the use of this site.  It provides the user with a wide array of information and services.  It is easily navigated and offers a vast repository of writing services.  After exploration of this site, I found that the offerings extend much further than I could have expected.  It is not only a writing resource, but also offers assistance with computer programs such as PowerPoint, and APA Style, resume writing and research paper assistance.  Information covered on this site goes beyond basic grammar, punctuation and spelling; it offers professional services such as Writing Across the Curriculum, Teacher Assistance (material, handouts, etc.), ESL, as well as, Internet links for additional resources.  This is an amazing site, I would highly recommend to anyone with problems or even general questions in regard to the implementation and use of the English language.",5
220,"I only did for about ten minutes looking at ESL specific area.  I have come to this site before for writing resume for more advanced students.  That was more general area.  It was really obvious from the beginning this was a good resource.ESL handouts materials are the ones that we should all have, but don't always have access to.  In my school, schools supply textbooks and they don't have too much reference materials in that particular book.  The school can't afford to buy better books with more meat.  Ironic, but reality.  So this is collection of handouts is immensely valuable.Materials seem to be picked according to the needs of ESL classes.  ABE (Adult and Basic Education) programs normally are run with slim budget, any teacher and any program can have more suppliment materials.  I try to organize a class by theme and when the need arises for grammar or specific points in details, the materials presented here work really well.Technical Remarks: I like the simple interface and JavaScript menu works well.  On top of reference materials, there are exercises to accompany.  They also supply printer friendly HTML version and PDF to download and print.  That is nice.",5
221,"Great tutorial, its important,that, all people target objective, without it, the motivation go down lamently.",5
221,"I wish I could have accesed more of the course, but was stopped short of it. After reading the peer review, I am certain it was everything I hoped it would be.Technical Remarks:Unable to access certain parts of the course.",4
221,"This tutorial is a great blueprint for designing online courses.  Some of the questions readers are invited to consider are unusual in this kind of resources--such as those that ask the course developer to consider the context of other courses offered in the department.  The workshop suggestions are thorough.  The tutorial would have been even more powerful, though, if the authors had used some of the ""cutting edge"" knowledge of exemplary course design in developing it.",4
221,"Excellent portions, but dated information on learning styles. Worksheets are helpful, but could be consolidated. Impressive resources and links. Examples from various disciplines are very helpful as is emphasis on student perspective. Technical Remarks:The navigation could be more consistent. User not always provided with clear path back to tutorial after using links.",4
221,Very helful tutorial for instructors who are just starting out with online teaching. Gives them some broad and important ideas to think about.,4
221,"Great ""starting point"" for anyone who is designing an online course. The modules are clearly written and provide specific examples.",4
221,"This is a very thorough, well-designed, and thoughtful approach to putting together a course. It could be used by a novice instructor or as a refresher for someone who has been designing courses for some time and wants to be sure that he/she is on track creating solid student learning goals. The authors provide some solid take-aways in the form of worksheets that educators can reuse in designing future courses and many links and ideas that will improve the design of different types of courses. This should take anyone reading carefully and completing the worksheets between 1-2 hours to complete. It can be used in faculty development settings or just as a self-study.",5
221,"This is an exceptional resource designed to guide course development. It would serve well as the foundation for design of traditional as well as web-based courses. As the authors mention, it is not the only approach nor is it specific to geoscience.

The resource is comprehensive and VERY well organized in a step-by-step manner that includes handy worksheets to help you organize material and apply the concepts to your own course.",5
221,"This is an extraordinarily comprehensive course development tutorial/process.  I appreciate the focus on student learning outcomes/goals, and the desire to design the course in a manner in which achievement of the outcomes can be facilitated and assessed.  I especially appreciated the wide range of assessment tools.  

The only potential drawback is that the tutorial is appropriately comprehensive - faculty looking for a quick fix or 10-minute-course-development workshop have come to the wrong site.  The creation or revision of a course should involve deep consideration of goals and methods, and this tutorial can readily help you to do this.  There is an expectation that days are spend on this process, and I can't wait to block out time so I can work through the lessons and take full advantage of the process.  I also appreciate the information for those running faculty development sessions - I expect to use this in the future.Technical Remarks:no difficulties-  this was very easy to navigate",5
222,A great tool to study the heart. It is a very high quality animation.,5
222,"Terrific site for introduction, review and testing.  Interactive and easy to use.",5
223,"This textbook is a solid, basic introduction to statistics; the coverage is as I'd expect (a little bit of probability, covers basic regression, etc.). I am considering adopting it as a supplemental resource for undergraduates who feel they need more background work (in an introductory statistics class in the social sciences). 
 
My main textbook goes more deeply into research design, causality, and the logic of why we do statistical work, which is not the goal of this text, but the two complement each other well. If I were looking for a more no-frills, basic introductory book, I would certainly consider this book over many of the books available from textbook publishers.
 
The strength of this text is the number of practice opportunities - there are about 100 problems at the end of each chapter, plus dozens of examples throughout the chapters. This means there's a large amount of repetition, which will likely appeal to some students. Given the sheer number of questions, I haven't worked through very many of them, but haven't noticed errors in the ones I have gone through. There are answers to selected problems in the back, as is common with stat books. Each chapter ends with a list of terms and a brief review of each section, which seems useful.
 
The pace of the book is probably too slow for students who are more familiar with the material; I could imagine this working better as a main text for a high school statistics class. Although the pace isn't what I'd ideally want for undergraduates, this book doesn't talk down to students as many introductory statistics textbooks do (e.g. talking about how they're probably afraid of numbers).
 
Unlike some undergraduate textbooks, there aren't examples pulling from SPSS (I don't teach in SPSS, so this doesn't bother me), Excel, or R. There are tips along the way for using the TI 83/84, which, again, make the text feel like it's aimed at high school students.
 
The thing I dislike most about this book is the visual layout. Admittedly, this is a minor issue, but I found the pages to be too busy. Sections break at random points, there are boxes outlined in blue all over the place (some of which carry over from one page to another), and the font is small (which makes it hard to read on a smaller screen, and, on a page with only text, means the page looks a bit overwhelming). None of the figures appeared blurry on my screen, though I'd like to see the purple color used in the figures swapped for something easier to look at.",4
224,"This provides a quick, clear explanation of podcasting and the basics of how it works.Technical Remarks:Easy to view and understand.",5
225,"I rated this material as a prospective reviewer for a Quality Matters/MERLOT project.  I find that a checklist, while appealing visually and easy to use, may be lacking in detail.  I might suggest that this checklist include links to Florida Gulf Coast University’s ‘Principles of Online Design’ at key points where further description or examples might be helpful. Additional glossing of some educational ‘jargon’ might make this tool for easily used by those without an education background.",4
226,This is a text-version tutorial on basic research skills.  The content includes all the basic research subject matter needed by a high school student or college freshman.  Effectiveness would be increased with less text and more visually appealing lessons.,4
227,"The description says that this is part of a collection. I only saw the scatterplot/correlation coefficient simulation, but I thought it was excellent, and I plan to use it in my simple linear regression lecture next semester.  There is also a link to the ""mirror site"" which is an article about many other applets by the same author that look very interesting.  I hope they're on MERLOT somewhere.Technical Remarks:Very quick and easy to use.  Ideal for a lecture example when introducing correlation and scatterplots.",5
228,Wow! I like this. I wish I had seen it before my presentation a few weeks ago to Delano Unified. I was trying to teach them language acquisition via the concept map. Great link!,5
228,"I spent several hours with this site and its concepts. By the end of the term, I had attempted a mapping activity with each of my classes as an instructional tool as well as a learning tool. Great option for visual learners who may not rely upon traditional outlining techniques.Technical Remarks: Initially, I found the site's spatial arrays very disorienting. After a few minutes of exploration, it became reasonably user-firendly.",5
228,Very easy to use. I will probe it with my students the Next curse.The support for collaborative Cmaps development is very interesting.Technical Remarks: I couldn't see the Information/notes when I exported the map to HTML (ths coudl be an improvement for future versions) ,4
228,"Once you get past the obvious charm of this program, you discover a remarkable depth of potential. I have been using Cmaps for some years now as a problem visualisation and solutions conceptualisation tool (got that!). My most remarkable discovery was the a??linkinga?? statement. I have used many mind mapping tools, but this is the first one to really force me to think about the relationships between concepts rather than using it to map discrete ideas. Using it as intended imposes a remarkable degree of discipline on my ideas maps and forces me to challenge assumptions about the issue or problem under examination.I have also begun experimenting with it as a knowledge mapping tool a?? something that its originators have already explored. The results so far are very promising.The other great feature of this application is being able to use it as a display/presentation tool. It exports to html and produces an output that I have used to successfully present at conferences and workshops.Its capacity for enhancing teaching and learning experiences is excellent. I have used it with colleagues as a planning tool and can see its potential in the classroom for collaborative learning and assessment.One of the strengths of this program is that the features do not get in the way of its prime purpose. It is simple to use and I hope it stays that way.Technical Remarks: Very easy to instal and set up. Tends to run a little slow on lower-end machines, but this is managed by keeping number of concurrent applications open to a minimum.",5
228,Good information for constructing Concept Maps.,4
229,Good Site.  I have librarians that come in and present material of the same manner.  This site covers what they do.,4
229,"One of the topics I teach in my Computer Literacy class is evaluating web sites. I'm going to have my students use this site.  I like the site because it presents criteria for evaluation and then has the student evaluate sites and ""grades"" those evaluations. It is a fun site!",5
230,A great study resource for anatomy/physiology classes. Very fun to use but it does require some prior knowledge.,5
230,I liked this site.  I think it would be useful in an advanced anatomy and physiology class after the students had been through the materal once.  It would be a great way to apply and test yourself after completing specific systems.  The review of anatomy after the case was useful and the feedback provided after answering a question was good.Technical Remarks:The site was easy to navigate and very user friendly.  Some of the pictures were graining and difficult to see.,4
231,"The ABLEDATA site is an extremely comprehensive database of information related to assistive technology. By searching the various elements of the site, my credential students have become more aware of what's available for students withdisabilities. Reading about assistive technology in a textbook gives them content knowledge, but seeing the product and hearing how it has impacted the lives of real people is invaluable for their education.Technical Remarks: There are two versions of the site available. The Full Graphics site is recommended for users with a 28.8K or faster modem and who have no difficulties with Javascript. The Low Graphics site is available for anyone whose equipment does not meet these specifications.",4
232,"Students love Animoto, especially those who lack confidence in their digital creativity. Animoto would be a great tool to have students use to share work after they have experimented with digital photography. Advanced students may be frustrated with the inability to edit the video.  However, this will provide an opportunity to introduce them to more sophisticated digital video editing tools.",4
232,"I use Animoto in several of my education courses for student teachers and teachers returning to earn their MA degrees. I can capture images and video clips using my iPhone (or digital camera) and can create upbeat and timely summaries of our class activities for viewing by our next class session. Animoto allows me to model appropriate use of digital technologies for my students. Furthermore, my students are able to turn around and use it for educational lessons, field trips, and more. Of course, we discuss school policies and expectations before they do that.",4
232,"This would be an excellent tool to use to ""hook"" students on a particular topic for class discussion. It has a variety of professional and personal uses.",4
233,I found this website while searching for lunar phases animations.  Wow!  Jackpot.  Everything from phases to stellar evolution to understanding the physics of astronomy.  I teach 9th grade earth science and these are some of the best flash animations I have ever found.  I used them this week in class and my students loved them.,5
233,"I used this site with pre-service teachers, who designed a lesson using it.  Their fellow students then completed the lesson and evaluated their experience with the site.My teaching methods students found favorable results with the site.  All the students who completed the work involved in the lesson found the site usable and educational.    Overall, the site was given very high marks, and those who designed the lesson said they would return to the site again.  Thank you.Technical Remarks: The common complaint revolved around the videos of star formation, with mention of the lack of a start and stop button, a restart button, and audio.  Otherwise, good marks.",4
234,"I am a college instructor learning about online pedagogy and spent several hours this past week reviewing the materials at this site.  Published in 2001, this site appears to have been last updated in May 2003.  The quality of the content is excellent.  There are many resources for learning available at this site and with some guidance from the instructor, students' learning should most certainly be enhanced.  Overall, the materials are easy to use, particularly the ""Related Exhibits"" that accompany four of the documentary segments.  The interactive components and ""exhibits"" for each subject area are subdivided and presented in a way that facilitates the user's understanding of the major ideas and concepts.  Also helpful is the online glossary (""Resources""), the Hominid Profiles pop-up screens, and links to ""Related Resources"" (books, articles, and Web sites).Technical Remarks: First time users might benefit from an instructor's overview of the site before they access it themselves, although orientation to the site takes only 10-20 minutes.  Unfortunately, I did have technical difficulties at this site: I was never able to watch/hear all of the taped segments.  I was able to watch one segment of the documentary and then parts of other segments; likewise, I was not able to hear all or part of the audio segments.",4
235,"Very useful teaching tutorial. Even I am not a specialist in business topics, I got progress in the topic.",4
235,Lots of good information on business attributes. Not sure how useful it would be to someone who is not enrolled in that college so therefore why it is on Merlot howeber.,4
235,The content is quite good as it is self-contained and concepts clearly outlined. The audio is excellent and the video quite sharp and content organized fairly well. May be difficult to use if the mode of delivery is strictly face to face without any form of technical equipment.,4
235,Very systematic; clear presentation; ,5
235,"This material is an excellent resource for those in a business discipline. It was clear and concise and easy to use. The concepts built upon each other and the resources provided will assist business students to find credible information to complete projects and case studies. Because case studies usually refer to real-life companies the resources provided will be useful and will save students time and frustration. The material will also be beneficial to those who want to research companies for job interviews. The resources provide ways to find information about products already on the market and competition for those starting their own companies. The website will be easy for instructors to assign to students and the quiz will test learning outcomes since it focuses on how to find information and when to use it. Overall this material will provide a great learning experience. Having pursued a business degree, I know how beneficial this will be to students.",4
235,Needs generalization for non U.S. based companies. (I teach in Canada). Many sites cover this type of topic.,3
235,"Overall Rating:
4.75/5
 
Method:
For the purpose of this review, this site was used strictly for experience and review purposes and was not used in a classroom setting.
 
Technical Use:
The initial review was done in Google Chrome, Version 34.0.1847.116 m supporting Marcomedia Flash Player and Java scripts. The site was also reviewed in I.E 11 but not as thoroughly. The OS used is Windows 8.1 on a Samsung all-in-one touch-screen computer.
Ease of Use:
The site as a visual tool is very effective and easy to use. It provides text that will assist those that are hearing impaired. Worked on Samsung Galaxy tab3 on Google Chrome App. It is diffcult to assess as to if the material is accessible for those with visual impairments – the site is very graphically driven.
 
Comments:
The Learning outcomes are clearly defined. The site is rich in content and ideas as to the potentiality of MERLOT. In an actual publication, the user will have access to valuable information and resources. Knowing how to use the information will make it much more pertinent to the learner; however, as it is, it is an effective visual aid to teach a process. If the item were available as a guide, the information would be updated regularly so that it has not been updated since 2007 has no bearing on the usefulness.

235,I found this resource to be an excellent primer for learning how to obtain valid research and information. Navigation through the site is mostly intuitive. Without any background in business research I learned so much from the resource that I was easily able to do well on the quiz included at the end. This resource is excellent for high school students and beginning business majors in higher education. I used Mozilla Firefox version 28.0 and it worked perfectly.,5
235,"I found this presnetation excellent and easy to follow. Though I don't have a business background, I was not lost on many of the topics discussed. The program gave descriptions, and additional info that was impartant in understanding the entire issue of business research ",5
235,"I really enjoyed this presentation. As a beginner, I would not know where to start or how to network for my business. Great information. ",5
235,"Some of the learning objectives include:  To learn basic concepts of research using concepts such as a public company, a private company, shareholders, ticker symbols, fiscal year information and security and exchange commission.

Provides learners with basic information about particular companies.Tests research skills with a quiz.The site provides learners with an introduction to how to conduct research in a business class.  There is a basic tutorial that uses company websites, contains library databases and has a quiz at the end.  Each one of the instructions are descriptive and includes a voice-directed prompt. This material is an animated presentation which allows for interactive exploration of the guide using pop-up definitions and tabs. The sound quality is impressive, as are the graphics.  The material also includes a glossary of terms and a quiz.  Technical Remarks:Used Internet Explorer with high-speed internet. Contains visual and auditory prompts. ",4
235,"Excellent learning material for students who are just starting out as business majors. Provides fundamental knowledge enabling students to create a detailed and accurate analysis of companies in a short period of time. Focuses on pursuing a few reputable on-line resources, consequently the student avoids the 'mile wide and an inch deep' assesment. However, one draw back is the assuming everyone is a student with access to academic material. Suggest alternatives (public library, historical centers) as alternatives to academic institutions for individuals conducting general research outside the classroom.Technical Remarks:Very thorough step-by-step analysis with clear explanations and quiz at the end to test comprehension of material presented. ",4
235,Excellent resource for a number of different courses and workforce opportunities.,5

Otherwise, the tutorial is intuitive in in its organization and use.",5
235,Nicely don!,4
235,"I am not a business educator, but if I were, I would definitely utilize this resources. It is very informative, efficient, accessible, It will allow learners to be engaged in learning.Technical Remarks:I found the technical aspect to be quite engaging. As I clicked on the different links, each one was accesible. I am saddened when I  find a great source only to find that the link is no longer active. However, this is not the case. I especially liked the commentator throughout the site. Overall, I found it to be efficient.",5

236,"This site has very accurate information about topics involving historical documents, the three branches of government, how laws are made, and voting rights.  It includes a glossary for vocabulary terms and quizes and games at the end of lessons.  This site is very useful as a review for Civics and Economics.",4
236,"I actually used this site in my teaching-learning activities.  I found it to be extremely helpful, interactive, visually stimulating, and age-appropriate for my 5th grade students.The materials accurately presented the concepts of U.S. government and its 3 branches.

Out of all the tutorials that I  have looked at and have read up on, this is my favorite because it covered the parts that I had most trouble with and it was the only tutorial that was easiest for me to study from.",5
238,Uses Adobe Flash though the description says java applet.  Beware for iPad and Android tablet usage.,3
238,"A great beginning exercise for those learners who have pre-requisite knowledge of how medical terms are broken down--what combining forms, combining vowels, prefixes, and suffixes are and the rules around bringing them all together to form a term.  ",4
238,Nice animation of word parts and the quiz/test opportunity will be good reinforcement for students to practice combining work parts prior to being tested.Technical Remarks:Easy to use,5
239,"This is an excellent learning object on a case study of a schizophrenic patient. Specifically involving the aspect of a thorough assessment, this material provides an excellent example of the mental health profession's approach to caring for a schizophrenic patient.  A great way to introduce schizophrenia to students or to exemplify the medical model of psychological treatment.Technical Remarks:No problems seen upon several reviews.  (The clicking to the next page button is a bit too small and annoying but nothing seriously troubling)",5
239,"A good learning activity for beginning nursing students studying schizophrenia.  I would like to see this developed further for interventions, evaluation, etc.  I have not used this at present, but will plan to in the future.Technical Remarks:easy to use, requires flash.",4
240,"Recommended for a very basic digestion class - grade school or junior high, or fun, overview for general public.  Graphics are appearing and easy to understand.  A.D.A.M.s images used and they are always very good.",4
241,"This is a good Distance Learning Presentation. The materials has presentation which illustrate good time management skills. There is quite a bit of text, but the layout of the site is designed to minimize scrolling.Technical Remarks:One of the interactive crossword puzzles does not open",4
241,Very useful to help students feel more comfortable with learning online. There are self-assessments that the students can complete. The students also find the multimedia tutorials useful.,5
242,Current and data heavy...As only NASA can!,5
243,"I spent the better half of an hour viewing this site. I thought that the material contained useful information and photo's that relate to a variety of historical art including ancient art, European decorative, European painting, and works on paper. It would be a very useful resource for an art major, or any art enthusiest. I found the ancient art most interesting because I am very interested in the history of ancient civilizations. The web page was loaded with easy to use links to information or virtual art galleries. I would recommend this site for even the first time user.",4
243,"This site is very impressive.  You could spend hours here looking at just the images that are available online.  I have used this site to put together presentations for state and national art education conferences.  I sent an e-mail seeking permission to use a few of the images in a national presentation and received a positive and pleasant reply within two days from FAMSF.  (Of course, I then used this exchange of e-mail as an example of paying attention to copyright and how to seek permission with my students.)   This site has a wealth of information and for those of us who are hundreds of miles from a big art museum, a site like this one makes a huge difference to us and our students.",5
244,"This is a great website about tolerance. There are many different categories to few for teachers, parents, teens, and kids. The website offers different sub pages that a person can go to for information about hate groups, how to respond to it, and information that goes on in everyday life about it. I think it is also a great website to hear personal examples of hate all around the world. The website gives a teacher enough content for new curriculum and allows the teacher to search for job openings. There are also links to the hate groups established throughout the world so students get a first hand opportunity to see what actually goes on with a hate group. It is also beneficial to see how many hate groups there are in the United States. Each state has different groups that you can view if you click on the state. Overall I was entertained by this article for quite some time. I highly recommend anyone out there to take a look at how are nation responds to this website. ",5
244,"Overall this is a great idea.  Hate needs to be talked about EARLY in age and it should start at school.  I believe that if it starts in the classroom the attitude at home will eventaully change toward hate.  Thre is so much diversity in the classroom and that is where hate is centralized.  Children need to learn that hate is NOT the answer.  Today our world is becoming so much mreo diverse and hate is becoming a bigger issue.  We are seeing more and more Afrian Americans, Hispancis, and Asians coming into America to have a better life and we are not allowing them that because of hate and our children are seeing this and acting as we do.  Our children need to be educated on how hate can not be a part of our country we are the land of the free and we cant have hate a part of this.  I beleive that bring hate education into the classroom is a great idea because of how diverse everything is becoming and how much bigger it will be in 5, 10, 20 years!",4
244,"I loved this website, it's very easy to use and is broken down to attract certain groups of people (teachers, students etc..)It gives tons of information that is vital to all.I only spent about 20 minutes browsing through the site and read for about 20 mintes. I would use this site in my classroom. It's eddectiveness is very high. It's an easy read and everyone can relate to all of the material. ",5
244,"I really liked this website, it caught my eye and kept me reading.  I could spend a long time with this site and although I originally planned on browsing, I actually ended up spending 20-30 minutes just reading. The quality of content was nice and it was very easy to use and understand.  The effectiveness of this can help both students and faculty learn many different things.  I feel that because of how easy to use this website is, first timers will not have a problem exploring and learning new things.  I did not have any problems with this site and enjoyed using it. ",5
245,"This website is easy to use and does a good job of demonstrating how to find the domain of a function.  It perhaps oversimplifies the situation since the domain is always a connected interval with integer endpoints.  Also, I think the questions at the end could be more clear.",3
245,"I spent 15 minutes reviews this page and was very interested. This website I was able to use and input problems and have it help me come up with a solution. It was a creative way to come up with the answer. It also made it fun because it was just context, I actually go to play around with it. I like thought that the material was fun and accurate. It should good models and was educational. This helped me understand functions a little bit better. I struggle with this area and it made it fun and easy for me to understand. I felt that the effectiveness was appropriate for learning. I would use this site again for help because it made it fun and easy to use for a first time user.",5
245,"This site has very helpful features for learning the essentials of domains and functions.  The tutorial features, assuming one has the right plug-ins, are very helpful.  One of the best features of this site is that it doesnt insult ones intelligence, and yet it is very helpful for those of us who struggle a bit with math.  My student teachers designed a lesson using this site, and they not only were able to design a good lesson, they received excellent feedback from their fellow students who had to independently follow the lessons.",5
246,"This resource is very helpful in explaining an issue that many students struggle with in a way that makes sense and allows them to practice.  The information is shared in a video, handout and website content, which provides students with multiple ways of engaging with the content. It is easy to integrate into a learning management system for easy student access.",5
247,"This site does provide a basic overview of how to get up and started in using Microsoft Excel.  The language is easy to understand, short, and well thought out. This could be used to supplement an accounting class or a finance class where students may be required to use Excel to complete work within the class.  There is a reinforcement assignment given at the end of the tutorial to allow students to reinforce the skills and concepts introduced in the tutorial.Technical Remarks: The site was easy to move through and work with.  The order of the topics presented needs to be re-thought, as more advanced concepts separate basic concepts; it would be better to keep the basics together and then migrate to the formula and charting concepts.  The material was concise and served as an introduction, but it lacked 'interest.'  Diagrams and screen captures were used effectively, but adding some color, arrows, images, movement, etc. would keep the site more interesting and appealing.",4
248,Good resources,5
249,I will be taking this course in the Spring. I am looking forward to learning more about the human body,4
249,I found this site to be very informative. I explored the site for a good amount of time. The options are nearly endless.  One is able to explore nearly any topic related to biology.  The site is fairly easy to navigate through and students should have no problem using it.  ,4
250,"Starts out as a real survey but then turns into a request for information that tries to sell the test taker into buying a full report.  One could take the quiz and not reveal any personal information and not buy the report, but the value of the site may be then diminished as the results show up as a percentage on a grid.For fun, I took the quiz three times and gave the same answers on the first (and main) 25 questions. But I answered the personal data in wildly different ways each time.  Yet each time the percentage point of where I showed up on the grid was identical.Lots of ads. ",3
251,"I was drawn to this resource because I am always looking for new ideas to support faculty at my college. What I like about it is the set up of the activity, in that a user can use the left menu to go directly to desired locations of the tutorial. Also, there is a ""resources"" tab that has downloads and other helpful tools.  Before users access the material, it is important to note the following:
A headset is important because there is auditory contentWhile there is a ""transcript"" tab, it would be helpful to have the non-YouTube auditory content captioned.  Clicking back and forth to read the transcript is difficult if one cannot hear the presentation.  However, a strength of this material is that it includes a full ""print version"" of the lesson that a user can access to read the notes/spoken words along with each slide.Some of the provided content is very specific to the college that created this tutorial. For example, the BOPPS Lesson Planning Model is not one that users at my college would have a working knowledge of.  I would need to take this model and other similar content and transform it for use within my own college.  This resource uses SoftChalk and is a perfect showcase of what that tool is capable of.Be sure to check out the resources tab for a great handout on Universal Design.

256,"I reviewed the site just by looking at it for around ten minutes or so.  I thought the content was high quality, the materials really show things that could be educationally significant.  I think it could be really effective to enhance teaching and learning, it is simple but yet it explains how to use the powerpoint well and also provides pictures.",5
257,"This course has tremendous potential but needs work on the logistics and navigation through the online course.  It was cumbersome deciding where to go first on the site because the course syllabus, rubic, and other important documents were not easy to locate.  Students need to easily follow the course organization.  The videos in each of the chapters were excellent and the section topics were excellent and very relevant. Each of the chapter videos opened but the videos inside the chapters did not open as the link was broken.  With some motifications to the organization of the course on the site I believe the rating should be 4 or 5 star. Technical Remarks:need to repair broken links",3

266,"The Work Ethic Site is a great introduction to the world of work.  The content was valid with useful models and resources.  The instruments and self-assessment tools were relevant and easy to use.Technical Remarks:The only concern is the evaluation portion of this site. How would the learner know if they successfully passed the course/lessons? What are the requirements for effectively completing the course/lesson? A rubric or grading model should be used to inform learner of progress.Additionally, some of the links were inoperable such as Thought, Word & Deed from the Publications navigational link.Overall, lesson The Work Ethic Site is an effective teaching-learning tool that can achieve satisfactory learning goals.",4

267,"I reviewed the materials for about an hour, I kept re-reading the material to try and understand it. So i tried to do the problem and follow it. It was still quite difficult for me to understand. If i had to evaluate the quality of the content i would agree that the material accurately present concepts and models that are eduacationally correct, because following the problem i come up with the same answer as well. The potential  effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning would be achevied if the teachers taught it well and explained correctly. Evaluating the ease of using the materials, for my first time was a little difficult to use the software, its a bit complicated. But overall an interesting experience and new way to check out math.",3
267,this site reminded me of a problem with the igloos and power lines that we are currently doing in class right now. i felt like i could understand a little bit more now seeing as how we went over it during class today. overall i enjoyed the site and just like the igloo problem i am going to try and grasp the whole concept of the problem and see if i can figure something out i couldnt before,4

267,"A good website link.. Very imformative with the puzzle.  I am not too bright when it comes to graph theory, however I followed this explanation better than I expected.  I have mentioned this before, I believe websites with tons of information like these should be at everyones disposal.",4
267,"I loved this site! I only wish that I'd know about it when my children were small. It is a great reference tools for parents, which will personally assist them to teach their children mathematics, or show them where to go to get help, or material. It is also beneficial for students who need help, as there is an interactive portion (CTK Exchange) that allows you to post questions, and receive responses from other members.  There are interactive games, and puzzles that would keep a child, or an adult in constructive play for hours. I spent about an hour on this site, and because of the vast categories  in math available on  this site, I will use it as a tool if I have questions that my math buddy, or myself might not know the answer  to.",5
267,"Right when i first browsed through the site, i automatically spotted interactive examples regarding the related problems on the page. I viewed under the section of puzzles on graphs, ""Lucky 7"". I read through the problem about Lucky 7 and tried out the interactive example they had on the website, i failed miserably. The point was i was learning actively, this site provided alot of useful information about the puzzles that are solved through graph theory. For a first time user, i feel as though they'd really enjoy this site, for learning, or for using the example as a demo for their lecture. The site is at first technical in terms of finding more puzzles, but if the user thoroughly views the site page, the outline of links should catch there attention rather quickly.",5
267,"I Looked at this page for about ten minutes using the links provided and felt that this was a good source of information. I had never seen this material before and was able to learn much about it. I feel that the quality of this material was useful because it not only provided pictures and descriptive detail, but it also provided other links you could use to get more information. I felt that this was very effective because it used pictures to explain and other used other links to provide more detailed information. The materials for this page were easy to find and easy to understand by the descriptions. It also gave sub-headings for the other links related, so that everything would be easy for someone that had never used the site before. This was a very interesting topic and had a lot of information to help explain it.",5
267,"I found the Three Glass Puzzle interesting and graspable.  I spent about 15 minutes poking around the website and reading.  The highlighted words that have links to definitions and explanations   were helpful with understanding the puzzle's steps. I strongly believe using puzzles in teaching truly enhances the interaction of a student or class, and this puzzle would do well in teaching applications of the graph theory.",4
267,It was very easy to use in the way of reading and understanding. I appreciate all of the people offering different solutions to problems.Technical Remarks:This material can be used effectively I believe for expanding the way students think about a single problem and where it can go. The content is high quality.,4
267,It only took a couple minutes to go over the sites contents. It interested me because it seemed like a problem we would go over in my current math class. I tried out the problem and it took me a while to understand how to get it right. It's useful that all the possible solutions are shown. I also liked that it explains how to do each step. This site really relates to a math class like the one I'm in and is a good problem to learn about.,3
267,"I spent about 35 minutes reading the material on this site. Then I spent another 25 trying it. It has a lot of information and makes you put your brain to work. I made some of the materials way more complicated than it really was. I enjoyed working out the puzzles. The site covers many topics and provides solutions. The site provides great visualization of the subject, therefore making it interesting. Its actually not as easy as it seems, to solve some of the puzzle. It is defiantly time consuming but fun. It helps a person develop critical thinking skills for sure. The materials presented are educationally significant but may seem hard to understand at first. The site contained graphics which was a great help. The material may seem a bit unclear because it seemed to me like it was lacking an introduction to the concepts. I would say that using this site as a teaching aid would not be the best way to go about teaching students on the matters described. It is an interesting tool for those who have a passion and great interest in math. Those who have the time and like math puzzles will defiantly enjoy this and probable could spend hours working on them.Technical Remarks:At first the site seems like its not to user friendly, but after some time anyone can defiantly get the hang of it. The puzzles are very interactive and interesting if you spend the time to work on them. The site can be improved to make it easier for users, because the concepts are were useful.",4
267,It took me about 20 minutes to explore this website. It surely is a confusing website but after playing around with it for a long time I got a hang of it. I like this puzzle because it actually made me think about it and had me solve it. It is actually not as easy to solve as it seems. When you get in the depth of the puzzle you realize that it uses a lot of critical and conceptual thinking. This material definitely present accurate concepts and models that is educationally significant. As a teaching method the puzzle games are great exercise for all the students to use. It would be a little hard for the first time user to use this material because it takes a lot of exploring. But I think it is something that everyone can learn from and can get benefit from.,5
267,We spent 45 minutes doing one of the puzzle. The material was good but difficult until we figured out we could not solve it. This was actually a good exercise for us to think about. I took a group of three people to figure it out. It was easy to use the software. When you click on link it takes you to the first puzzle and you try it.  ,3
267,this site is great. i was confused at first but after spending a little more time i start getting the concept.it is fun has a lot good interactive information. at first i thought i would only spend a little time and i would get bored but i spent more time that i anticipated because it was fun and at times challenging.,4
267,"I spend about hour and half, I found this site is very useful, especially in its possible to develop ones lateral thinking, as well as problem solving skills.  I personally think that first time users, like I was one of them, will find it very easy to make use of this in future life.  Im sure I will use this site in my free time and also I have sent it is linked to my some friends to India. Anyone can benefit from using this site.  Cool!!!!!!!!",4
267,This is very interesting.  I personally love this kind of puzzle games.  I was able to figured out how to solve the 3 glass water game without reading the material after 10 minutes.  The puzzle games are very interactive and great exercise for everyone to use.,3
267,I had a lot of fun with this website.  It helps with conceptual thinking.  This website is very good for helping people who are struggling with visualization.  As a teaching method this also makes the lessons a little more interactive and fun.Technical Remarks:You can spend hours going through all the different applications and problems.  Its a great tool to get students interested in math.,5
267,"The time I spent was trying and reviewing the material from this link.  From this, I spent most of my time trying to figure out what to do on the site to try to figure out the problems or issues discussed.    Many of the problems I had to read a few times to try to figure out what there was to do and how to solve the problem.  I was also interested to see what all the other links were on the problems, as possible steps to help work through the problems.	I found the whole thing to be quit difficult.  When I am on the internet looking at a web like this, I feel like I am always looking for the fastest way to find the answer to my question.  When I am looking at something like Math, I want to look at a book.  I feel this site and problems had no introduction that was clear.	I have taken other internet classes at San Jose State and I found those class sites to be much easier to use.  Everything was a step by step process making it very clear.  This site should be completely redone and make is more user-friendly.  At least I found it to be this way for The Three Puzzles.",1
267,I spent about 15 minutes trying the puzzles. to me I felt that it was not explained well enough to figure out the puzzles. The content of the software talked about the history of the puzzle and how it was used.,3
267,"I spent about 10-15 minutes looking over the ""Three Glass Puzzle"" and I never knew it could be so hard to understand math wise to pour liquid from one cup to another.  This article does help me understand it better and the graph helps a lot.  ",4
267,"i looked over this puzzle for a little while and i tried it out a couple times and i found it rather confusing. Once i just stopped and thought about it for a few moments i relized i needed to get one cup of water in a glass. so as soon as i figured out what steps to take to get that i solved the problem. the second time i tried the problem i solved it rather quickly.i think this a good tool to use because many things in math are confusing at first, but if you stay with it, you can learn it, and it feels better once you know it.",4
267,"I really enjoyed this puzzle because it was very visual.  I learn alot better when things are drawnout, so I was able to remain focused on the problem.  I found the program simple to use without conflict.  This problem took me about 5mins to solve, and after I found the answer; I forgot how to solve it haha.  I liked the problem because it would show my previous steps, so i could learn form my mistakes.  So, I could visually see what I was doing wrong. rather then trying to remmeber it on paper.",5
267,"I spent about 30 min on this site.  I only spent 30 min because I was stumped at frist and I really wanted to figue it out. The question seemed familar to a question my professor asked us in class about ""the igloos.""  I got stumped and frustraded and just I gave up.  I just couldn't slove it.  I enjoyed the site though it was intresting and very creative.  I'd use this in the class as a fun thing to do and think about.  Technical Remarks: I had a fairly easy time using this site.",4
267,i spent about 15 minuets trying to understand this but had a hard time doing so. It is hard for me to be able and see the puzzle i need someone to tell it to me. im not sure if this would en hance any learning.Technical Remarks: i think that first time users well have trouble with this because it is hard.  that is what i think about it.,3
267,"I found this site to be particularly useful, especially in it's potential to expand one's lateral thinking, as well as problem-related visualization, skills. I spent well over an hour wrapping my brain around various problems, and the explanations and analysis are top-notch. I think that first time users, as I was one of them, will find it very easy to make use of the materials and they will surely be pulled in by the many puzzles presented. I believe that this site would be an excellent tool in helping students think ""outside the box, "" as it were.",5
267,"This is a good site to go to.  The game was fun and interesting.  It took me a couple of tries but in the end i did do it. I was able to make at least one of the glasses contain 4 oz. of water.  The material presented here can be used in an elementary school type of environment to teach kids on how to do math using computers and making math fun.  The model here allows for teachers to use this as a teaching tool for students who find math hard and boring.  This will make math fun for the kids.  This was very easy to use.  The instructions were very simple and thorough so that any one would be able to understand it. Even me, who is so bad with instructions:)",4
267,"I throughIy enjoyed this site. I spent 20 minutes checking out this site of three glass cups. I was confused, at first, about the whole point of the game because I have Math issues. However, after getting totally frusterated and loosing paitiece (after about 15 minutes) I looked at the answer and it made complete sense. I then enjoyed going back and doing it knowing that it could be solved and that I could actually do it. Thanks for the brain exercise. It was fun.",4
267,"I am a math g student and like puzzles.  This is a good one!  It is easy to navigate within the software and keeps the user wanting to try again and keep at it to solve the problem.  The water puzzle reminded me of a scotch and water puzzle our teacher presented to us in class - so I tried it out.  Although I was unsuccessful after trying three times, curiousity got the best of me and I viewed how another had solved it.  It poses to the user a very significant problem solving technique - if at first you are unsuccessful, try it again with a different approach or a different technique.  I spent about an hour on this puzzle.<",4
267,"I spent about fifteen minutes trying to complete this puzzle, unfortunately I was unsuccessful at it. This puzzle does accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant because it helps show the users in trying to come up with different models to try and slove the puzzle.  By using this puzzle in the classroom it will allow for a lot of critical thinking by the students.  The use of this software is very user friendly and the directions given are very simple and can be understood by anybody.",5
267,"Thinking back to one of the Die Hard movies I saw, I remeber Bruce W. and Samuel L. J.  by a fountain and they had to undo a bomb. They had to measure 4 units of water and they had a 3 and 5 unit container . The ""3 glass problem"" was pretty much the same situation and since I forgot how they did it in the movie after trying the problem for a little bit I was able to get the answer. I found this site to be very interactive as well as educational and i would recommend it to those who like math problems or just want their head teased with for a while",4
267,I spent a few minutes browsing this sight and I thought it was very interesting.  I think this sight is educationally signifigant because of it's content.  Possible solutions are given and each step is given and explained in great detail.  Because of this I think this sight is a great teaching tool and a great educational tool.  This sight was set up a little weird but was not hard to figure out for sure.  First timers should have no problem on this sight.    ,4
267,"I spent about 25 minutes trying to make sense of this puzzle and then solve it.  Not only could I not solve it, but I couldn't make sense of it.  I found this game pushing me to try over and over again, challanging me to solve it.  I think it would be interesting to see someone who knew what they were doing to solve it and explain what they did to solve it.  This game does present concepts that are educationally significant, and I think by finding out how to solve this would challange students to think critically.  There was not a problem using the materials and software.<",4
267,"I spent about 25 minutes trying to solve the 3 glass puzzle. This is a very fun interactive game it could be used as a in class project. Its challenging and you have to try different combonations and keep track of what you did. I found it very easy to use and try and try again. I finnaly did cheat and got the answer , and found the actual sequence of numbers fairlly simple. ",4
267,"I SPENT A HALF HOUR ON THIS SITE ""THE THREE GLASS PUZZLE"". I READ ALL THE PUZZLES,LOOKED OVER THE INSTRUCTIONS AND STEPS. I TRIED THE VERY FIRST PUZZLE AND GOT A HEADACHE  I USED THE TRIAL AND ERROR APPROACH BUT I GOT NO WHERE SOO I GAVE UP THEN  STARTED TO WRITE NOTES AND LOOK OVER THE STEPS AGAIN.I NEVER DID COMPLETE THE PUZZLE BUT I DID STUDY THE SOLUTION FOR A WHILE. THIS MATERIAL DOES ACCURATLY PRESENT CONCEPTS AND MODELS. IT GAVE GOOD INSTRUCTIONS  THAT WERE PRETTY EASY AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THEY GAVE NUMEROUS MODELS TO TRY,DEFINITIONS AND SOLUTIONS. I THINK THIS WOULD BE A FUN EXERCISE FOR A MATH CLASS, IT WILL CHALLENGE EVERYONES BRAIN TO THE FULLEST. I THINK TOGETHER AS A CLASS IF SOLVED IT WILL ENHANCE EVERYONES BRAIN FOR A HOT MINUTE! AS A FIRST TIME USER I FOUND IT VERY EASY TO USE. THE SOFTWARE IS VERY SPOKEN FOR...",4
267,"I spent another hour tonight browsing for more interesting articles on the Merlot website, but instead I stumbled on the three glass puzzle at (http://www.cut-the-knot.com/water2.html) which was very interesting since I have been experiencing similar, but not so difficult puzzles to solve in my current Math class. I liked the logic and reasoning that led to a possible solution. I think more puzzles like this will be very helpful to stimulate a student?s mind and inspire effective reasoning.Sam",5
267,"It took me 5 min to understand this puzzle, but it took me 45 min to solve--and I never could.  First when the problem drove me crazy, I was going to give up on it, but then I asked one of my sisters to solve it, it challenged me to keep going with the game.  However, neither of us could solve, but at least we tried.  This puzzle is a very interesting game for your brain, because it makes your brain work and think--even if u don't want to think.  I'm not used to these games, but I found it very challenging, especially when you play it with someone else, and especially if that one is your sister or your brother, cause you want to prove that you are smarter than him or her.This puzzle was entertaining and challenging more than teaching, and a good exercise for your brain.",4
267,This puzzle had me for just about an hour.  Although i was not able to solve the problem I did enjoy trying.  Everything was explained clearly and the graphs were great but I just could not figure it out. At first I was just guessing and hoping I could solvbe it that way but I was wrong.  While opening up the different pages to the problem I came across the step by step solution to the problem which I thought was pretty cool.  Overall i think this is a pretty cool site if your in the mood to let your brain do a little exercise.  ,4
267,"I spent a total of twenty minutes, mainly because I was paying tweny cents per minutes at the local Kinko's. I tried to solve the puzzle by trial and error. I could not solve this puzzle by any means. This sort of problem, sort of reminded me about the Igloo question, you asked towards the begining of the semester, with the diffrent type variations. As a first time user, the software was very understandable.",4
267,I spent 10 minutes trying to solve the problem and had no clue.  I was really confused.  I didn't understand it.  I didn't see anything to help me out.  The program would not help me learn.  It was easy to use though.,2
267,I love math when you are presented with a problem such as the three glasses problem. I spent a good fifteen minutes figuring out the problem. I also tried some other activities and they really make you think. This type of math is great for teaching problem solving for everyday life. The material is pretty easy to use and fun. Anyone can benefit from using this site.  ,4
267,"I spent about 45 minutes trying to solve the puzzle.  My first attempt was trying to solve it by trial and error.  No luck.  I very quickly noticed that I was going in circles.  My second attempt was a better approach.  I wrote down all the possible variations of 8 and my list was rather long.  As I was making my list, I noticed why my trial and error approach led me in circles.  I tried to use another approach by trying to minimize my list which would utilize certain combinations.  Still no luck in solvivng the puzzle.  I eventually solved the puzzle but I was not sure on how I was able to accomplish it.  After I solved it, I looked at the answer and it made the puzzle much easier to understand.  When I first looked at the puzzle, it appeared that it was going to be fairly easy to solve.  I very quickly found out that it was easier said that done.  The three glass puzzle consumed by mind as I attempted to solve it. (My original work was done on Friday 921 at around 10pm but I was unable to save my comments.)As a first time user, the software material was fairly easy to use.  ",4
267,I browsed through the information that was provided and found that I could easily understand what was being said.  The site did an excellent job making it less complicated for the students to learn the different solution methods.  The instructions were easy to follow and the quality of work was powerful.  ,5
268,"This test is very helpful for institutions and for faculty who are offering online courses or programs and want students to make an informed decision in following an online course. With the development of technology we also tend to assume that students possess the needed and expected skills to study online, however practice shows the opposite; or at least it shows that not all students have the skills and sometimes they don't know which skills are required to be a successful online student.",5
269,Very interesting,5
269,"A good visual tool for teaching how to solve a classic programming problem.  Segues nicely into  material for dissecting the problem, developing a solution algorithm and then writing the resulting function.Discussing the mathematical formula for determining the minimum number of moves needed to solve the puzzle with any number of disks, makes this a good example of what programmers need to consider in order to develop efficiently running programs.Technical Remarks:Sometimes the applet controls were only partly visible after loading. This is easily resolved by refreshing the display.",4
269,"I played the game 10 times, and came up with increasingly better resluts. (Scores were 32,29,23,19,21,17,19,17,17,15.) I was stuck at 17 moves, and then watched the animation a few times. After that I was able to get down to 15 moves. I thought this game was fun and I appreciated the feedback, and also the animation. This would be a good teaching tool for K-8 students.",3
270,"I am a student at Broome Community College.  It was easy to learn hoe to use the material within the site.  Being a history site, it is educational and a good learning tool.Technical Remarks: This is a good site that is easy to use.  I had no problems getting to the site, and no problems navigating through the site.",4
270,"Site deals mainly with American Revolutionary war subject matter, with links to many different sites on thais subject.  Has games for all ages to learn about history, as well as links for more advanced subjest material.Technical Remarks: Site is easy to navigate, with short explanations of each site listed.  Can be used by people of all ages.",4
271,"The content is good, but the website is visually displeasing and looks really outdated. It's very text heavy and there are a lot of missed opportunities for using visuals to make the website more engaging.",2
271,"Briefly reviewed--15 minutes
A short introduction to LC and Sudocs classification systems with a glance at the DDC as well. Okay for complete novices to call number sequences--students newly exposed to collections classified according to LC or SuDocs. Not enough depth and breadth for anything other than the briefest of introductions to LC and SuDocs. Without more examples this is too scant a look at call numbers.
More examples of call number order/sequencing for SuDocs particularly would have enhanced the work. 
By contrast sites such as :
http://www.lib.msu.edu/publ_ser/docs/student/Manual/quizes/sudocsbasics.html
for Sudocs do a little bit more...

or
http://www.mtsu.edu/%7Evvesper/dewey2.htm#What
for DDC call numbers.Technical Remarks:Material is easy to use...simple text.Visually stark and plain, more graphics/color etc would have improved presentation.",2
271,This site will be very helpful to those who are new to libraries.  It provides clear instructions on how to read call numbers.,4
272,"This tutorial is a simple yet effective tool for learning how to give presentations.  While it is very plain and consists of mainly text describing what makes a good presentation, the material also provides great example presentations and further links. As a great resource for both teachers and learners, this site outlines the most important aspects of public presentations.",4
273,"I found the link to be a great asset to my lesson on the 1930's and the Depression.  I currently use The Library of Congress to retrieve photos of this time period for supplemental activities.  Students often refer to this page for project materials.  The page could have been better if there was a table of contents or some type of list that described the resources.  I only happened upon some of the documents by accident.Overall I think this is a great reference for a variety of perspectives and its use of audio, written and visual material allows each learner a different resource.",4
274,"This is a great resource for instructors teaching Web design courses, students taking web design courses and anyone interested in web design.",5
275,"This was a good tool to get the conversation started about teamwork.  I especially liked the student testimonials at the end of the presentation. As the student mentioned in a comment, it would have been helpful to see how the students interacted with this material.",4
275,"This is a reply to Nancy's comment: The intent was to briefly introduce the topics, begin a discussion, and provide an opportunity for reflection. The goal is to help to prepare students to be successful in group projects. I look forward to the day when you begin to share your work on Merlot.",5
275,"Good content, but format is not conducive to active learning.  Content could be taken to an entirely new level using quality standards of instructional design.Technical Remarks:Tutorials are very passive learning.",2
276,"The official resource site for the excellent video series, Africans in America. The site is text-based and provides a recap of the narrative of each of the four episodes, a resource page for each episode, and a teacher's guide.",3
276,"My students regularly use this site as a place to find primary sources.  I require students to locate primary sources on the web and to do document analyses in all my classes.  The sources on the site are carefully selected and have good annotations.  

The site also contains narrative history on a variety of subjects related to African Americans through 1865.  These narratives, especially used with the primary sources, could be effectively assigned as required reading upon which to base a 3-5 page research paper.",5
277,Wonderful progression of information. Could see using this for someone who is out sick during this topic.,5
277,Very detailed but easy to understand.  Well done.,5
277,"This is an excellent site.I just enjoyed going through the site.I got deep understanding abt the topic.
thanks to the submitter and author of thread.",4
278,"The podcast works, but the book does not work.",4
278,"This is an amazing resource for graduate students and faculty interested in recent research on learning. I especially like the ability to search for all instances of a word or phrase to see how the book addresses a concept such as ""constructivism.""Technical Remarks:Fully searchable on-line book. Can annotate and print whatever you need.",5
279,An excellent interactive exercise that investigates the concept of chemiosmosis. Students are required to draw conclusions from information and data provided. This is a topic that students find very difficult. Very well organized and well written.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash player,5
280,"I really liked this test.  I have used Learning Style tests for years and some of the options were transparent on what learning style they would lend themselves to, but not all were.  I always like the idea of giving my students and faculty a learning style test since so many do not know how they learn.  There are also good explanations for what each learning style is and how to accommodate that style.",5
280,This would be a great first night activity for students in any class.  The quiz could help them discover their learning styles and be able to apply it in future class sessions.,4
281,"Excellent usable audio editing software.Technical Remarks:Simple, User friendly",5
282,There are so many resources for learning about whales. ,5
282,This was an excellent lesson plan!  It was well organized and clearly laid out.  It also has all the resources that a teacher would require to use the lesson.  The creator has stated exactly what needs to be done before an during the lesson.  The creator has also listed possible extensions for the lesson as well as homework and an assessment.  I like how this assignment is interactive. It is a great way for students to be introduced to evolution!  My middle school students will love how a story goes along with the assignment.  I also like that the assignment is inquiry-based.  So the students have to use their clues to decide where the whales go along the geological timeline.,5
282,"This is a very good resource for evolution classes. The flow of information is somewhat difficult to follow, as the website layout is not extremely user frienldy.",4
282,"Excellent, timely, well-researched, and highly recommended for both content and pedagogical quality.I came across this tutorial last year while reviewing lessons on evolution, especially lessons that address ""evidence"" as has now (again) come to the fore in teaching about evolution in public K-12 school context.The sequence of whale evolution is the new favorite textbook example, partyl because it includes such fascinating and fun examples of intermediary (which, by the way, certain anti-science interests had previously touted the lack of).I WISH I were currently able to try this lesson out with kids, but as a former science teacher I am confident it is a good lesson.Technical Remarks: Suggest to secondary-level teachers to prepare by reading up a little on latest findings/research on whale evolution and/or have kids do some up-to-date research. Also, check up on the current state of the creation/evolution ""controversy"" and any legal battles in your area.Having kids critically examine the ""evidence against evolution"" (IE creationist criticisms) might be an intersting exercise if the teacher feels confident enough to separate rigorous science from pseudo-science and to separate relgious indoctrination from science education.",5
283,"Excellent collection of culturally authentic (currently 2600+) images. Entries are divided into categories and subcategories. Nouns only, no verbs (that I found).
Site may be browsed or searched. Images may be copied and used in presentations, etc.Technical Remarks:Search engine worked well.
Each item linked to Leo and Wikipedia, when available.",4
284,"Although all the islands are important, “The Steps” island shows you the different drafts the student has gone through to arrive at her final conceptual framework.  These major topics are what determine the research questions and the major topics in the chapter 2 literature review. One of the great values of this program is that it emphasizes the constantly evolving process of determining your research questions.  My students feel they are married to their first questions and this program stresses that those first questions need to developed based on reading and research.Technical Remarks:Easy to use!",4
284,"This is a great resource for someone who is trying to understand both the purpose for a conceptual framework and the process of creating one. The videos that accompany the learning object are helpful because students generally like to hear about someone who has been where they are and struggled right along with them. This is an interesting and well-done learning object that could fit into another, longer online course.",4
285,"This website makes learning so much fun. I like the way this site gives you a variety of opinions from characters, emotions, thought bubbles, objects, and scenes. I would use this for students to allow them to get creative. By giving them a specific boundary but allowing them to use their imagination, students will be encourage to write and have fun. This site makes leanguage arts fun for students. Highly recommend! ",4
285,"I love it.  I actually had my students draw their own comic strip with Greeting vocab, but this is great for the artistically impaired.  Also something fun to do on the computer.",5
285,"The site provides a great learning opportunity for students to practice using voice (a component of the 6+1 Writing Traits). It provides students with the opportunity to write a comic that has characters, emotion, and speech bubbles. It also fosters organization in student writing. I think it is a great tool for students to have fun while writing! I love that the end product can be printed and/or e-mailed.Technical Remarks:Technically, I think the program is solid. I do wish that there were voice overs on the directions so that younger students could benefit from this great tool too.",4
286,"This an outstanding overview of basic ""internet-ology"" and the flow of data throughout the worldwide web looking through the lens of a home user.  This video would surely benefit anyone looking to obtain a rapid understanding if the basic elements of data throughput and the internet. ",5
286,"I remember trying to explain this topic in an introductory E-Commerce class, and it was hopelessly complex.  This pictorial tutorial uses the analogy of streets and highways which makes the topic accessible to almost any level of student. Technical Remarks: The flash plug-in and instructions are available on the first page, so that you can use it even if you don't have flash.  Clicking on the next button is about as tough as this one gets!",4
287,The site has a good outline of the dvd.  Unfortunately I was unable to see the video.,3
287,"This is a web-based video that is played in two parts.  I utilized this video case in a Business Ethics class.  Although, the video case has nothing to do with ""business"" ethics, the subject matter evoked quite a bit of discussion almong the students.  The subject matter was also conducive to diverse backgrounds in the clasroom, since not everyone has the same experience with ethics.
The website offers the video, questions between the two parts of the video that I used for discussion, a method to enter a class decision and comments from both the characters and experts in the ethics area. 
It took approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to get through this project.  My students really enjoyed it and I plan to use it in future classes.Technical Remarks:Internet access",4
288,I like the use of explaination along with the selections of primary sources. So often students have problems understanding the context just from reading the source.,5
289,"This IAT site provides an excellent opportunity for students to recognize how quickly we can make these implicit associations and the potential impact on us and others.  It can generate useful discussion in the classroom about stereotyping, prejudice, etc.",5
290,"I have started using this in my classes for the common reading at my college this year: Huckleberry Finn. This is the most complete site on Twain I've seen. I found especially riveting the section on the various depictions of Jim over the years and what those portraits say about the culture of the times in which they were created.

I create links to certain aspects of the site on my on-line schedule, which directs the students to certain areas I want them to see/use/experience. For example, the Mark Twain ""quiz"" was a fun way for them to introduce themselves to aspects of Twain's life before we even started reading.Technical Remarks:This has an easy point-and-click style. Nearly everyone, especially computer-saavy students, are able to use this site. The main difficulty (we should always have this problem) is the overwhelming amount of material that the site covers.",5
291,"This is my first encounter with Merlot and it is really cool. The ""game"" / application / website exceeded my expectations. I will interact with it more when I have more time.Technical Remarks:Functions well and easily",4

293,"This self-directed website offers many tools for anyone interested in prepping for college and career planning, choosing the right school for your needs, etc. The website provides no-cost education and career-planning programs for the U.S. Armed Forces military members.",5
295,"Great resource to do a quick poverty simulation in an intro to social work course. Students always enjoy this exercise. I often put them in groups and have them debate and discuss each decision. It can be an eye opening experience for many students, especially in general education courses that are full of non-social work majors. ",5
295,"Very interesting approach to simulation. A lot of prompting, but very engaging, nonetheless. Not sure if this is the type of activity that you can play multiiple times or not. Will be fun to review it in class and get student input.",4
296,"Overall the website is made for teachers in finding supportive exercises and materials in teaching Clinical Psychology although it can also be very helpful in teaching many aspects of general psychology as well.  I have used several of the in class exercises and especially find that students enjoy the ""Personality Disorders"" exercise where everyone at the party is said to have a personality disorder and the students must classify each character by their axis two appropriate label. It is classroom appropriate, while also entertaining and engaging.  Overall a nice site to have for some good classroom exercises.",4
297,"This format is easy to use and very manageable from a time and content perspective for intro psych students. I will use it as a pre-class exercise. With something tangible in hand it opens up a myriad of opportunities for in-class activities that are self-reflective.  I have not used it yet, but I  play to in 5 weeks when we address personality. Great resource!",4
297,"The personality test acted as a great tool for understanding the Big Five Factor Model. It was very self- explanatory and the test included a wide range of questions to cover each factor. The learner can fully engage in the activity because it offers a first-hand experience with a test that many psychologists use as a reference regarding personality differences. A very popular and somewhat difficult concept at times was portrayed in a manner that students can use and find intriguing. While the test was well-rounded, I would have provided more introduction information about personality and the Big Five Factor Model. I also found some of the questions to irrelevant. In addition, I would have liked the results to go more in-depth about each factor and explain to each student what their results symbolized.",3
297,"This learning object is a great assessment tool and introduction to personality in Introductory Psychology.  I have used it in my classroom for several semesters and students always enjoy it.  I have students bring in their printed results and group the class up into the factor that they scored the highest on.  Following this I ask all the groups to plan a vacation that they would go on with their group (with the came personality trait that all of them scored highest on).  They can go anywhere, do anything, bring anyone, and so on.  It is neat to then go around to the groups and see if the vacation plans correlate with the personality factor for that group.Technical Remarks:If the user does not answer all the questions and presses submit the unanswered questions will be highlighted and a prompt says that the user must answer each of the 45 questions.  (questions below this are optional)",5
298,This was an interesting site. It contained a lot of information. It describes how psychology changed in the mid 1800's. It was very interesting.Technical Remarks: The site was loaded with information and easy to navigate. ,4
298,Interesting site for those interested in the Victorian Era.  A slew of information could find you engulfed in this site for quite awhile.  I spent about a half an hour and decided that that was enough.  It may be a bit overwhelming as a teaching tool but it is useful.Technical Remarks: Easy to navigate site.,4
298,"I am not much of a history buff, however, I really enjoyed this site.  This site contains inofrmation that is not every day!  I took me about 45 inutes to read through the material.  It wasn't really the easiest site to understand, but I think that may have to do with my complete lack of knowledge on the subject.  it did contain a lot of interesting information.  In addition, I think it would be a usefull tool in a history class.  Technical Remarks: This site is pretty easy to navigate.  However, it contains mainly text book-like information.  It is broken up into different sections well.",3
299,I have used this website as a student and found it is great use for class.,5
299,"After many hours working with this site while in graduate school and then later as an instructor creating lessons for my own classes I can attest to the excellence of this site regarding its breadth of content. For a resource on Antiquity's arts, literature, architecture, and geography, few sites can even begin to rival its vast digital archive. That said, since its was redesigned the presentation of the enormous cache of materials in Perseus has become increasingly imposing; efficient navigation is not readily apparent. The layout of this site and its clumsy search engine (that pulls up every single possible match for a subject) will at once please researchers and baffle freshman and sophmore survey students. The well designed exhibits created (it appears) especially for this latter trove browsers do a much better job of eliciting a quicker recognition of the value Perseus; employment of them will augment classroom or online instruction. WSTechnical Remarks:no additional audio/visual pluggins necessary.",5
300,"I incorporated this site into a lesson for high school anatomy/physiology students.  The content of this site was great.  The site incorporated many different learning styles including: reading, visual, and auditory.  This is a good lesson to use when reviewing the respiratory and circulatory system.  It is also a good review of certain concepts in genetics; inheritance and pedigrees.  Students enjoyed the interactive experience and they got to apply their knowledge to real life situations.  The quizzes on the site reinforce learning by making sure the students have read the supplemental material.  The materials were fairly easy to use and each screen had step by step instructions posted.Technical Remarks: Sometimes the site was extremely slow, but this may be due to Internet connection speed.  Also, sometimes the instructions in the Virtual Cardiology Lab seem to be a bit small for some students to read.  Some students with disabilities also had trouble running a mouse; this was compensated by pairing them with an able bodied partner.  However, if you could make the site keyboard activated also, it would help these students to navigate the site.",4
301,"I reviewed the site ""Virtual Mummy:Unwrapping AMummy By Mouse Click"".  This was not only a veryinformative site but it was also a very fun site tointeract with.  It is very helpful because it shows manyimages and even has quicktime movies of differentmummies.  You can learn a lot about how medicallyknowledgable the Egyptians were before ost othercivilizations even knew what the body was.  This siteshows any different views of mummies and it even letsyou see a mummy unwrapped layer by layer.  This site isa very good one because not only is it a cool site tovisit, but it also provides you with a 'hands on' typeof learning experience.  The only problem I found withthe site is that you must download an upgrade to mediaplayer to view it, but it is a short download and it isdefinatly worth it.      ",5
302,"I really enjoyed how much detail you went into explaining the method of the physical examination, the normal and abnormal findings and even a self evaluation at the end. More sound clips or photos would have made the site more interesting.Technical Remarks:Some of the sound clips for the hear sounds were barily audible.",4
302,I was glad to discover this as a resource for my physical assessment class. I am a faculty member in a nursing program. Technical Remarks: The information was easy to access and would be easy for a first time user. I agree that more information about the total person assessment would be beneficial. This definitely is built on the medical model and not the nursing model. ,4
302,"This website provided easy access to basic physical examination procedures that could be understood and utilized by those not in the medical profession.  The language was detailed, specific and easy to follow.",3
302,"The physical assessment page had outline information and on a physical assessment page graphics, pictures, etc. would be helpful",2

Sensory assessment of the face indicates a pin is used to assess sharp sensation. Use of a pin is discouraged because of the potential for injury. Rather than a pin, use a broken applicator so the cotton end is splayed for soft and the broken end is then used for sharp.We also noted that the general assessment lacks a holistic perspective of assessing the mind and the spirit which are integral with any assessment of the body.Bonnie Faherty & Deborah Roushbonnie.faherty@csun.edu droush@valdosta.edu",3
303,"I assigned modules from this site in a course on Chinese Civilization to complement readings from the textbook The Cambridge Illustrated History of China, also by Patricia Ebrey (Cambridge UP, multiple editions). I liked the additional images on the site that supplemented those available in the textbook.  The website modules tend to be focused on art and art history topics since they are more amenable to multimodal presentation.  The online modules also include important discussion questions scattered throughout to encourage users to think about the material.",5
304,Good intro site for orienting students to RT.,4
304,"This item is currently under review by the Teacher Education Editorial Board.  The site is steeped in current and useful information for student teachers and teachers, especially those involved in arts education.  There are many types of readers  theater scripts and useful suggestions for designing best practices while implementing readers theater with younger students.  Scripting sheets, including team scripting, recommended resources, and information about Aaron Shepard's book, Stories on Stage, are on this site.",4
305,"This material includes a variety of active learning strategies and techniques that can be used in any discipline.  What is especially helpful about this resource is that the techniques are not just listed, but offered with context and application, providing users a broad, but descriptive sense of how to use them and what learners might get from them.  Both new and seasoned faculty will walk away from this resource with ideas.  The general nature of the list of activities is a strength in that any content area can use and adapt these methods.",5
306,This resource provides valuable information relevent to today. With the growing problem of obesity in our country it is imoprtant to educate and encourage physical activity. Very user friendly site. An interactive quiz/lesson is included. Excellent resource for educators.,5
307,"I Found this resource very helpful because it links literature with science. It also includes many activities as well as ways to extend those activities. It has a few worksheets as well. I just wish it included California standards, not just Arizona standards.",4
307,"I found this resource to be very helpful. The lessons are very detailed and seem easy to use in the classroom as part of a unit on adaptations. Also they are all very hands on, giving students real life experiences and allowing for inquiry based science. I think students would really enjoy them, especially since they focus on local plants and animals the students see daily. Lastly, I really like the extension activity of having students create their own desert creature. It is a good way to assess student learning and also incorporate language into science.Technical Remarks:This website was very easy to navigate.",5
307,I think students will enjoy the activities provided in the lessons.  The activities are helpful for students to understand how animals and plants react and adapt to the desert heat.  The extension activity to create their own desert animal or plant will be fun for them and even a good way for the teacher to assess their understanding.Technical Remarks:No technical difficulties.,5

308,"It is imperative that we teach our students how to effectively evaluate information and the sources of such information.  With the cyclic advancements in technology, the ways in which information is transmitted has sped up significantly.  Students have access to a wealth of information in a myriad of forms (video, print, and internet).  The skill of evaluating information for its content, separating the salient information from the blurb, is crucial.  This skill can be integrated into the curriculum under nearly any discipline.  In ?Advertising Literacy,? Terry Dugas has presented a variety of exercises, which challenge students to think and process information.  I spent about 5 hours navigating my way through the site.  The information is presented in a very appealing manner.  There is a wonderful incorporation of graphics and audio.  The information was presented in a logical order.  It is fun and easy to follow.  There is quite a bit of information and resources. I was thoroughly impressed with the way in which the lesson was presented.  The materials accurately present the concepts and models of its design. I did, however, experience some difficulty in loading some of the pages on the site.  I am not certain whether or not there was a problem with the links.  This might make the use of the site difficult and frustrating for some first time users. Nevertheless, overall, I found this website to be well planned and extremely helpful.Technical Remarks: I am not certain whether or not there was a problem with some of the links.  This might make the use of the site difficult and frustrating for some first time users. ",5
309,"Great site! With all these resources, teachers have the ability to pick and choose the things they need to supplement their classrooms. Regarding student use, students need to be aware that Java needs to be installed and that the site might run best using a specific updated browser. Technical Remarks:Java plug-in",4
309,I really enjoyed viewing this resource.  So many students have issues with graphing linear equations and need items like this that are both interactive and engaging to help them learn this concept.Technical Remarks:This website is very user friendly!,5
310,"This is another example of the the field of Psychology ""going off the deep end."" Wait until child molesters and sexual predators have their day with the DSM. I did not like the site because the behavior behind it is not acceptable.",1
310,"I browsed the web-site for about twenty minutes, I was looking at it for an assignment in my Educational Psychology class. I think the information is very clear and straight forward. It is a great site to understand what it really is to be a transsexual. Putting this into perspective would definitely be useful in education. Gender differences are often a great misconception, I think this information would be very beneficial to learning and teaching..Technical Remarks: The web-site is very organized and easy to follow. Separating the information into categories allows the information to be easily accessed. ",5
310,The material on this website was very easy to read and very well organized.  I thought this was a great site because it helps show people see what it is like to be transsexual.  I believe this information could be very well used in the classroom.  I think this topic is very important for the education programs and is very beneficial. Technical Remarks: I thought this web site was very easy to read being that it was seperated into several categories.  It was very well organized.  ,5
310,"A great site for understanding the emotional and mental differences that make one a transsexual. The author organizes all the material so one can find what they are looking for, and she explains everything very clearly. I read the material for about an hour, exploring what it is to be a transsexual. This most definitely could be used as an educational tool. The information can be applied to sociology, and psychology. I did not give it the highest rating because the information was only subjective.Technical Remarks: The material was very easy to read though. The web sit was organized very well, as to let any new user find and or peruse the martial with ease.",4
310,"I spent about 15 minutes brousing the material.  The quality of the content I felt was very high with concepts that were educationally significant.  I feel it is a good teaching and learning tool because it is broken down into categories with good, interesting information following each category.  Technical Remarks: I think first time users will have an easy time using this resource.  ",5
311,"I used this site in conjuction with the viewing of ""A League of Their Own,"" in PE 334, Behavioral and Social Science Readings in Physical Education. The specific project description was as follows:""Project Description:In class, we will watch ?A League of Their Own,? a fictional film that is based on facts surrounding the women who formed a professional baseball team during World War II to boost morale while the men where away fighting. While watching the film, you should take notes on any social/historical issues that are present, particularly as they relate to topics we have covered in this class. The most obvious issue will be gender in sport, and how the female sport experience is influenced by norms and values in the film (remember, World War II takes place in the 1940?s). To help you with this, you must visit the following website http://www.AAGPBL.org/index.html. This site contains historical information about the AAGPBL (All American Girls Professional Baseball League). While visiting this site, you must analyze how ?A League of Their Own? compares with the real AAGPBL (as represented by the above internet site), with particularly emphasis on historical aspects of sport participation and femininity, as well as hegemonic masculinity in sport at that time.In addition, also search the site for other information related to PE 334 course topics, such as socialization into physical activity, media representations of athletes/sports, modifications in games, etc.""Overall, the project worked out very well, as students enjoyed the opportunity to make comparisons between the film (which many had already seen) and real life representations of the AAGPBL,
 as represented by this website. Many students were able to find similarities between the website material and film, and many found differences, as well. Discussion about that which drives these similarities/differences in terms of a 1990's reproduction proved to be beneficial to the student learning of historical and gendered aspects of sport.Technical Remarks: The website was very usable and readable. My students all indicated they were able to navigate with relative ease. They enjoyed the project very much! ",5
311,"Very well-organized and full of interesting and useful information for this topic.  Should be a great resource for instructors and students who want to delve into women's history and popular culture.  Given the familiarity of many students with this topic through the popular movie, A League of Their Own, I think students will enjoy mining this site for some good research.",5
311,"This web site has the most complete collection of historical information and graphic images about the AAGPBL available on the Internet. The articles about various former players are useful, although the site should encourage more reader contriubtions about former players. For use as a teaching tool, the site's information content is excellent. The site is very user-friendly.Technical Remarks: Pentium computer works best due to graphic images.",4
312,"Very funny!
I think it can be useful to my students when, after explaining thousands of times how to check the Wizard before entering the Conference for our Oral Lessons, they still don't have audio at the end of the course!

313,This is a great resource for teaching students about diabetes in the classroom. The site has a good information I would pull from it and share with my students. I can show them information from the site and they can use it. ,5
314,"After providing many STEM-related introductory textbooks for several years, OpenStax has finally produced an introductory American Politics textbook, and on close inspection, it is very good. This book is more comprehensive in the topics it engages than most introductory courses (the addition of separate foreign + domestic policy chapters is nice) and contains the depth necessary on nearly every topic. Like many costly textbooks from a variety of publishers, this book is not perfect. But, it is free, comprehensive, and contains a variety of learning aids that make it perfectly useable as the core text in a course that serves as an introduction to American politics.
It is available for free as both a high- & low-res PDF, EPUB, iBooks, through an online viewer, and in print as either a paperback or hardback for roughly $30/$50. No matter students' technological sophistication or resources, it can easily be accessed. While many seem to tend towards downloading a static format, OpenStax regularly pushes updates to content (for example, a post-2016 election update) as well as fixing minor errors throughout the textbook, so it is useful to access the dynamic content available via the web. I have yet to find a typographical or content error in the book.
The ordering and organization of the content of the book is natural and mirrors many of the existing texts on this topic. While an instructor may wish to customize the content of the book, little customization appears necessary, as at most, it requires simply reordering a few chapters depending on one's preferences. The many graphic examples and tables/figures throughout the book are on par with some of the better expensive textbooks out there, and pair nicely with the book's prose.
I will be adopting the book this fall, and supplementing with a variety of content from academic journals and journalistic resources. In sum, this textbook is a great example of what happens when OERs are well-funded by non-profits. The quality, accessibility, and content are incredible, and on par with textbooks that are $100+.",5

Supplemental materials	Blackboard and Canvas course packs including PPT, test banks, web links, videos, interactive data, etc. 

The quiz bank is substantial with upwards of 30 to 50 questions per chapter. The questions vary from multiple choice, matching, true or false,  and short response to videos. I love this feature. 

PPTs are impressive and updated with each edition. The data is often interactive and varied in color and form, and high resolution. Canvas course cartridge is included as well. 

The quiz bank is very limited, 4 quizzes in total (for entire text), ranging from 3 to 10 questions. 

The modules are chapter by chapter and appear to be more extensive, but as a means of assessment I am unsure until I load into Canvas and test to see how it aligns with the grade center/grade book. 

The PPTs are of lesser quality. This is apparent in the data often being limited and presented in a less sophisticated/not as clear manner (simple line graphs with thin lines, difficult to decipher color-coding, and keys). Pictures and data are often in low resolution and therefore look pixilated.

	Table of Contents  [*with comparative comments]

OPENSTAX

Chapter 1: American Government and Civic Engagement 

* Of note is the absence of clear overarching themes that are comparable to the LGSA’s  “5 Principles of Politics” that carry throughout all chapters, providing cohesion and clarity to students. 

Chapter 2: The Constitution and Its Origins

* Very similar to the LGSA covering the Federalist vs. Anti-federalist factions, historical events, and the ratification process.

Chapter 3: American Federalism 

* Very similar to LGSA, including cooperative vs. dual federalism. It even features the same cake visual metaphor (fig. 3.12). 

Chapter 4: Civil Liberties
 *Very similar to LGSA. I do appreciate the topical examples of Edward Snowden and the PATRIOT Act.

Chapter 5: Civil Rights

* Similar in base concepts to LGSA. I do like the focus on various PoC & gender politics. 

Chapter 6: The Politics of Public Opinion 

* This chapter does not have as much overlap as I would like, e.g. illusion of salience, push polling, measurement error, etc.  

Chapter 7: Voting and Elections 

* Again, very similar to LGSA (Florida 2000 election used as example throughout, voter registration, administration, turnout trends, direct democracy, etc.) with notable absence of focus on voter technology. 
 
Chapter 8: The Media

* Features similar base concepts such as agenda setting, framing, & priming. The data comparing Fox, CNN, & MSNBC is compelling. 

Chapter 9: Political Parties

* I prefer the LGSA focus on functions of parties (education, facilitating choice, collective action, etc.) over the focus on party systems, and polarization. Further, the absence of key concepts such as V.O. Key Jr.’s Three Faces of the Party is a notable content deficiency.  

Chapter 10: Interest Groups and Lobbying 

* Very similar to LGSA, though with noted absence of video links to Stephen Colbert and Daily Show clips satirizing interest groups here and throughout.  

Chapter 11: Congress

* The last section on the process is a weak point compared to the LGSA extensive infographics on the life of a bill. 

Chapter 12: The Presidency

* Very similar to LGSA with organizing between formal and informal powers, going public (and examples from FDR to Obama), and summary of unilateral tools (executive orders, signing statements, agreements, memos, etc.). 

Chapter 13: The Courts

*  I prefer the LGSA’s focus on fundamental typologies, e.g. types of law, types of courts, and core judicial principles (precedent, judicial review, jurisprudence, etc.). 

Chapter 14: State and Local Government 

*This chapter constitutes an addition, though one that is somewhat redundant given the requirement to have a separate California politics textbook. 

Chapter 15: The Bureaucracy 

* This chapter would benefit from moving closer to the presidency chapter. Further, I believe the LGSA’s focus on the missions and types of agencies is clearer and of more utility for students. 

Chapter 16: Domestic Policy

* This chapter seems to merge the social & economic policy chapters of the LGSA, and it does so without losing much content. I like this. 

Chapter 17: Foreign Policy 

* This is perhaps the weakest chapter, lacking a cohesive theme, and/or typology comparable to the LGSA. The pictures are not very helpful, e.g. pictures of former secretary of states vs. data of relevance of the topic.",3
315,"Fascinating interactive map site for me and I could imagine students of all ages being fascinated as well. If I were going to use it in the classroom as lecture, I might start with a question relevant to one of the maps and explore the answer together. Follow-up might be a relevant question on the same topic where students explore a different map in groups or individually, and report back their findings.",5
316,"Contains SEE (artificial) signs but does not identify them as such.  Does not contain grammatical instruction.  Contains many English synonyms that are mapped to a single sign.  For example, ""abrupt"" and ""accelerate"" are mapped to the same sign (FAST), but it is unlikely that this sign would be used to translate either word in context, especially given that one is an adverb and the other is a verb.  ",1
316,Useful for learning ASL,4
316,"This resource is a well-done visual dictionary of American Sign Language (ASL), and conssists of an alphabetical index and content frame. The content frame displays a looping video of the performance of the selected word along with a text description of how to sign the word. I was able to spend about 30 minutes, finding words of interest and seeing their sign performed, of this extremely well-done system. The video is quick and efficient, automatically looping several times. The user interface is not terribly elegant, but it serves the purpose and is not cumbersome. This resource would be an excellent resource for students in communication, speech & hearing, etc. fields. Though not necessarily an tool for communicating directly with the hearing impared (Wait a second, let me watch this video...), it would be great tool for learning and reviewing a large number of signs or could serve as a resource for more obsure words / signs. It's ease of use is one of its most positive features. Scrolling and clicking are the only skills required for use, making this resource valuable at ALL levels of education.",4
316,I reviewed this site by learning how to sign words that i would used eveyday.  Since i been working at my work i have had two people come in writing their order on paper or showing what they wanted.  This site is really helpful in many ways.  The quality is really good & i was able to see how to sign lang.  It was really easy to use this site but the only problem is remembering how to talk with my hands.,5
317,"This text provides an introduction to organic chemistry for students who require the fundamentals of organic chemistry as a requirement for their major. It shows the interrelation between organic chemistry and the biological and health sciences, making it easy to understand by students. It also illustrates the use of organic chemistry as a tool in theses sciences and stresses the organic compounds, both natural and synthetic, that surround us in everyday life, which will enables students to make the connections between organic chemistry in the classroom and the world around them. Key ideas pivotal to Students’ development in organic chemistry are further reinforced in end of topic practice problems which will help students to practice and test their knowledge.",4
318,"I have adapted this plan to introduce my freshmen to Shakespeare. I used Sonnet 75, and I have the students conduct the performance before trying to tackle the SOAPStone. Also, depending on your goals, you may want to skip the SOAPStone graphic organizer. I suggest having students form a circle around the room in order. They enjoy watching the sonnet move around the circle. Students have time to prepare their performance in partners, we have one ""rehearsal"" in the circle, and then we have a final performance. You also may want to adapt who reads aloud. As written, the lesson as one student reading and one performing. I found that students are less shy about performing if they are doing it with a partner. This year I did the reading so that all students performed. This was an opportunity to model reading a sonnet, and I could ensure that the performance kept going. I allowed students to use available props. My students were comfortable with Shakespeare and excited about Romeo and Juliet after this lesson.",4
319,"I like the fact that there is animation with each definition I viewed. However, I found it cumbersome to have to back to the beginning if trying to search/look up a definition beginning with a 'different' alphabet than the one you are currently in. Although there is a search box once you select an alphabet, you are limited to search only for terms in 'that' alphabet from that area.",4
319,"This site is now apparently a subscription-only service. I could not see even a sample of what is available. There is some procedure to obtain limited access for a short period of time, but one cannot review any of site without going through that process. ",1
319,This was a great usage of annimation but merlot users could not log in with a general password to evaluate without having to first view annoying ads.  Looked like a very large source for information on many diffrent topics. Wish I could have viewed it.,3
319,This site is just wonderful. It is a great source for the defining of Data Communications related terms. Technical Remarks: The graphics were great. It really makes you want to look and find out more even if it is irrelevant to what you need.,5
319,If there was a rating of 10 I would definitely give it to this site. Excellent technical dictionary!!! Each definition also includes an animation. Students seem to enjoy this site...concepts become real.,5
320,This was exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted an online resource that had a lot of information about Anne Frank in one place as well as something other than plain text. Great Resource!,5
321,Nice beginners website.  Could benefit from less link embedding and a search function.,3
321,Easy tools for individuals to navigate through for quick reference information. Clear and concise. Good supplemental material for students to utilize outside the classroom.,4
322,Content is clear and concise. Effective teaching tool to utilize in and outside the classroom. Good picture demonstrations.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate.,4
323,"It is a very rich material which covers the main concepts about Learning Machine. I wouldn't suggest this material in a self study context because, in my opinion, a good mathematical background is needed.",4
324,"This site has a wealth of information for use with student teachers, K-12 teachers, and higher education faculty involved in arts education and/or interdisciplinary education.  Both visual and performing arts are featured.  You cannot get through the entire site with one visit.  Instructors can use the site for virtual field trips, comparing and contrasting performances, and reviewing lessons.  The national standards for all subjects are posted here which makes it great site for the student teachers who need to understand how the national standards are different from state expectations.This site has received high ratings from the student teachers and public school teachers with whom I work.  Technical Remarks: Each evening at the Kennedy Center there is a live performance on The Millenium Stage that is taped and then archived so that it can be accessed online.  The archived performances can be viewed with Real Player.   Performances include everything from school choirs and dance troups to international performers.",5
325,Good collection of examples for introducing ASP .Net.  The site is designed for those with some background in ASP or programming.  Examples provide working models with access to the actual code for those examples. This site could be incorporated into assigned reading and practice.,4
326,"This website can be used as an open ended, student- centereed activity, classroom demonstrations, and includes lessons plans.  It has realistic graphics and has accurate content.

This resource will definitely help students who are struggling with balancing chemical equations.  It has graphic support included in the text to make it usable by English Learners. Reading level is at high school grade level. Minimal math skills are needed.Technical Remarks:It works on both MAC's and PC's, requires Shockwave",4
327,"This is a valuable resource, especially for more advanced Spanish classes that may be focused on the World today and in which the students are relatively comfortable with the level of Spanish that is used in the media.  It is without doubt a real-world website with instructional capabilities and could thus get students more excited about using their Spanish.

There is a section, ""El mensual: language focus"" that does have grammar explanations on topics such as pronouns and adjectives, however the explanations are very brief and general.

There are extensive additional vocabulary lists with words in both Spanish and English.

It appears that the material may not have been updated since 2006 based on the fact that there is a 2004, 2005 and 2006 ""Anuario/Yearbook"" but nothing since then.",4
327,"Most of the reading selections can be read and then follwed by listening activities using the audio files. Even though the reading and listening cover the same theme, the texts are not identical.  The reading text can be used as an advanced organizer to develop comprehension of the listening skill.  The topics change every week and deal with timely information about events around the world.  Generally, at least one of the readings has the audio component.  The same topics are covered in detail in English if the instructor feels that the topic requires more in-depth  information before or after the target language reading has been assigned. The audio clips are the voices of Spanish-speaking people throughout the world which merit the site for having such  a remarkable variety of authentic written and aural texts. The language notes are invaluable!  Technical Remarks: The audio clips are clear and precise.  It makes it easier to analyze the speech of the various regional dialects throughout the Spanish-speaking world.",5
328,"This is an excellent textbook - but a caveat to users is that it is currently hosted by the NCBI in a ""search only - no browsing"" format. It's possible to read every page of the book, but a student has to navigate to each section by typing in a search term that brings up the section in question in a list of search results. I've done that very thing -- provided students with the keywords necessary to pull up and read, for example, all the sections in chapter 29 -- but it's an awkward setup.",4
329,I reviewed the content for possible inclusion into my Introduction of Conservation of Natural Resources. The definitions for each subject were clearly understandable for use by my students.  The topics provided for reseach were the same topics that I use in my classroom teaching.  Thus this site would be helpful as alternative study for students in my class. Technical Remarks: I find that students require some type of visual display for examples.  The definitions could use a visual display to enhance to the student the definitions.  ,3
330,I enjoyed the animations.  A voiceover for each slide would be more helpful.  The quiz at the end of the slides is good.  I would like a similar class pertaining to the adult respiratory system and disease processes.,4
330,Technically sophisticated.  Encyclopedic detail.,5
331,"I currently teach radiologic technology to both first and second year radiography students.  Part of the curriculum involves being able to proficiently perform venipuncture.  This Power Point is an excellent resource for our students.  It gives them all of the necessary information they need to know prior to, during and after cannualtion.  It is very thorough, well-thought out and has a great flow to it.  The information was in-depth, yet broken down into simple enough terms for even a layment to understand. I would like to use this in my classroom in the future as a supplement to the information I typically provide.  Thank you for this excellent presentation.Technical Remarks:The pictures, diagrams and audio content of this presentation were more than adequate.  I found them easy to follow and very effective at providing the necessary information the students need to be proficient in venipuncture and IV cannulation.  Their were no glitches or hang-ups with the presentation.",5
332,"A fun way to test learning. Would need to have the course material first.Technical Remarks:If the instructor was not used to the Jeopardy template already, this would be a bit confusing to use.",3
332,"Good Model of a interactive exercise that can be used in different situations with different clinical Informtion.Technical Remarks:Simple
Some may need further directions on appropriate ways to use the game.",3
333,"The site requires either faculty acceptance or mostly purchase of materials, it provides free abstracts.  Faculty acceptance takes one or two days.  The site may not be updated regularly.  I searched for cases on Google and Marijuana, both are subjects of legal battles and only one case popped up for either leaving out a host of important issues connected with these searches. Technical Remarks:Very easy to use but the materials found must be purchased.  Recommendation of where to purchase is made with some available to faculty once a person verifies employment with a College or University.",3
334,This is a pretty straighforward learning exercise about immunity with some exercises to practice active and passive types of interactions.  It's a good learning object to try in the classroom.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash Player,4
335,So easy to understand when its visual I have already added it to my power points slides and blackboard acct.!!!!!,5
335,This is a great site to help students understand the basics about cellular anatomy and physiology.,4
335,"this is a good site,for understanding cell,DNA and many other basic biology.",4
336,"Wiill use the slide shows in class- Western Perspaectives II. As this site demonstrates, visuals bring history to life. A great retrospective of the life and times of LouisXIV and his monument, Versailles.",4
336,"I actually really enjoyed this website because of it's easy navigaion and beautiful layout.  It included a great deal of historical landmarks and an update on those landmarks, as well as beautiful portraits with a small description of each.  Again, learning a little history of France was fairly easy to navigate through, and would definately recommend this site to anyone wanting to know more.",4
336,There are many beautiful pictures on Versailles on this site.  It has great graphics and is extremely easy to navigate.  The page is viewable in several languages.

338,"I was given the opprotunity to use this approach in my Secondary Methods course at the University.  I was able to grasp the students attention and hold it the entire 85 minutes.  This approach gives students the ability to face important issues throught history, and other content areas for that matter, in thier own manner.Technical Remarks: There is an issue of student appropriateness.  But with an instructor monitoring the activity this issue is be easily resolved.",5
338,"I believe this site to be innovative for use in the social sciences.  One student from the social science methods class at NSU led my AP European History class in theater games.  The college student was successful in motivating the students to develop conflict and resolution in their improvisations.  In one 85 minute block, the future teacher had success and the students thrived on the theater games.  Theatre games can be used to introduce a unit, review a unit, or just for fun!  Thumbs up!!Technical Remarks: The site is easy to navigate, well organized, and gives great suggestions for use.  The games follow a step-by-step progression to allow for a successful activity.  ",5

341,"This website starts with the very basics of viruses to a more complicated level.  The explanations make a lot of sense without using a lot of computer lingo. It's very easy to navigate to the next page; the hardware and software items were a definite plus to add.  I would recommend this for any computer training class to help people understand viruses.It's designed for beginning to intermediate users, and the content is very fluid.  Good job on this page.Technical Remarks: very easy to navigate, maybe put in a previous page button.  A couple of the images didn't open in my browser, and the advertisements can be annoying.",4
341,Nice site for help with viruses and just basic information on viruses.,4
341,"The information was very helpful and useful for students as well as other faculty I mentioned it to. I spent about 30 minutes browsing it. It provides good information for those who simply can?t understand why viruses exist and how to get rid of them, if you can.  It was easy to navigate through out the page and having the tutorial in .pdf allowed me to save the file on hard drive and it also makes it easy to print and read.  It is a very effective tool for intro computer classes.  First time users may not be very comfortable with the navigating vehicle, but once directed, they will catch on very fast.",5
341,"Information was very useful and insightful.  In looking over this site the information was very good but could have been better utilized on paper. Most people who utilize distance learning use something to keep the learner involved.  This might as well have been a handout or article in print form.Time Spent Reviewing Tutorial: 10-15 MinutesContent Rating: Good Content, useful to those unaware of virus and virus types.Usage: This would be a good supplement to a class, to make learners aware of viruses.Ease of Materials:  Easy to follow, starts very basic, and builds upon previous learning.Technical Remarks: This was a simple page that any person could post.  Lay out was not pleasing to the eye and pages were static.  It was hard to distinguish one page from the next.  Although the site did have good consistency from page to page, the site was just hypertext links, which from my position do not involve the learners.  I found the ads at the top and bottom of the pages to be very distracting, and unprofessional.  I  think in the case of this site the redeeming quality of the site was the content.",3
341,"Great Site. It explained  Both hardware and software failure is still a leading cause of computer problems and not viruses. Good for beginners because it explained everything from the meaning, history, characteristics to the reasons.",5
341,"I spent about 30 minutes reviewing the material and will definitely use this link to get a quick and easy tutorial on viruses, its history, and their function.It uses a student-centered approach where it answers questions that are most confusing in the understanding of how viruses work.The quality of the work is outstanding and is updated on a monthly basis when needed.Technical Remarks:The interface is appealing with easy navagability.",5
341,Well done.  The user has a good chance of understanding viruses and what they do.  ,4
342,"As the review correctly indicates, this comprehensive web site is an outstanding resource. My undergraduate online OB students surf and discuss the link/report entitled ""The Business Case for EI."" For working adult students, the information contained in this report goes a long way toward illustrating the ""bottom line"" relevance of the EI construct.",5
342,"A great introduction to learn basics of Emotional Intelligence. The site has a lot or investigation showing the importance of the concept and applications. Due the explicit objective of promoting emotional intelligence in organizations, the teacher wont find critics or alternative concepts.

343,This is a 10 week online course about the history of the U.S. Constitution.,4
344,"Contemporary Chemistry is an excellent and extremely extensive resource for teaching chemistry at a variety of levels. I recommend it most highly. 

These on-line materials compose a set of comprehensive modules revolving around chemistry topics important to society. The package in its entirety is most appropriate for liberal arts college chemistry courses (for nonscience majors) as well as courses taught in high school. They are also very useful as supplements to higher level courses such as general chemistry, descriptive inorganic, and environmental chemistries. The materials are very comprehensive. Topics include those of general interest, such as the formation of the chemical elements in stars, as well as all important environmental issues and the role of chemistry in energy production.

The organization of the materials involves a central (and extensive) set of interactive material, sectioned into chapters, sections and subsections. Each subsection includes a set of web links for each topic, a review of the underlying principles for that topic, a concept summary, and a glossary that can be chapter-specific or complete. Navigation through the material is clear, affording an intended (and necessary) route through the material as well as the ability to move about at will. This allows students to make the best use of the order of topics while being introduced to the material, yet allowing them to quickly find specific topics when reviewing.

The authors have done a wonderful job incorporating true interactivity and self-assessment. Throughout each section, animations are used to illustrate points. These are generally interactive, requiring students to manipulate variables and observing the results. Moreover, these interactive simulations are associated with a set of guiding questions that lead the student through their exploration of the concepts being illustrated. Both the interactive and question portions are of high quality. The design of the animations is well thought through in that they clearly illustrate concepts while avoiding distracting glitz. 

As an example, the start of the chapter on the ozone layer begins with an animation illustrating how radiation of different wavelengths is differently affected when passing through the ozone layer. 

At most points along the way, students have available a quiz that allow students to test their knowledge on each topic. The quizzes work by having the student answer each question and then review the correct answers. These quizzes are well done and give the student a fair view of their understanding.

I thought that most everything that this site discussed was an important part of the Egyptian burial process, and that little time was wasted on menial facts. According to my learning, the information of this site seemed to be accurate and in line.Technical Remarks: I thought that this site was fairly easy to manage. Although, all of those links started to get a little aggrevating. It seemed like every link had another link. Other than that, the site seemed well orchestrated.",4
347,I enjoyed these materials very much. I particularly enjoyed the pictures and information provided.These materials gave me a better understanding of the mummification process and it's role in egyptian religion. Technical Remarks: I found the site to be very navigatable and easy to understand and use. There was a lot of information to covered on this site.,5
347,I found this website really interesting. I really liked how over the computer a view could look at art work that are in museams all over the world. Although this does not replace actually going to a musem it allows people to view things that they might never get the chance to see in person. I clicked on collections and exhibits and then explored ancient egyptian art. I really enjoyed looking at all the different pictures of ancient mummy coffins. I liked how next to every picture they gave a description of the piece along with a little bit of information. Technical Remarks: This site was very easy to navigate. The only problem I had was trying to figure out what to look up first. I found that all the graphics and text appeared quickly after the site was finished downloading.,5
348,"The material was used to analyze the graphic design interface. The students objected that it's full of information, it shows contents, news, advertisements, even a calendar, the site navigation is not clear and some links don't work. The color scheme is too plane, the page needs more contrasts between the chromatic and typography hierarchies. This cannot be considered a didactic material cause it has not been designed under teaching parameters like a teachers guide, a students guide and a level learning structure.Technical Remarks:Some links are not available.",2
348,"There are many different types of materials on the site (biographical timeline; small collection of paintings with titles and dates; photographs and descriptions of some murals) and it is very easy to navigate.  There are some VERY interesting original materials on the site, for instance clippings of a magazine to which Rivera contributed in 1928-1930 as well as film clips (in English) discussing Rivera's paintings.

Unfortunately, the majority of the material is exclusively in English with about a quarter in both languages.Technical Remarks:The majority of the media was easily accessible, however when I clicked on the photos on the ""Biography: Chronology"" page, I was taken to a page that said ""NOT FOUND""

The ""Virtual"" Panorama views of the Anahuacalli Museum were almost too small to make-out and I was not able to zoom in at all. The Film clips were also very small and the one titled ""Man in crossroads"" did not open at all.",4
348,"I used The Virtual Diego Rivera Web Museum with a second semester Spanish class in November 2003. The assignment was designed to take advantage of the social themes of the paintings and murals and to compare the lives of the indigenas with the privileged lives of the upper ruling class. To prepare for this assignment I had students read the Biografia Visual de Diego Rivera by Marela Trejo Zacarias, a student at Kenyon College:www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Mll/Spanish/Projects/TrejoZacarias/spanish.htmStudents working in pairs selected a mural or painting from the museum. Then they discussed the subject material, theme, symbols, and possible social significance. The present subjunctive with verbs of doubt and certainty as the grammatical focus tied in perfectly. As a followup activity they had to send me a PowerPoint slide with their painting and five original sentences using the subjunctive or indicative as a fill in the blank exercise.For example: Es obvio que la molinera_______(tener) una vida dura.I used their slides as a review the next day in class.Other less complicated assignments could easily be planned. For example, using La Sangre de los Martires Revolucionarios fertilizando la Tierra, students could write a creative short story using the preterite and imperfect tenses to describe the life of the two martyrs. What were they like? What were their lives like? What did they believe or want? How did they die? Why are they martyrs?This is a beautiful site, but since this site was not designed as a complete study module, it is left to the techer's imagination and creativity to find ways to make meaningful activities. A suggestion would be to incorporate a ""For Teacher's"" manual with suggestions for use in the classroom at all levelsTechnical Remarks: My students found the site easy to navigate and appreciated the cleaness and simplicity of the site. Images loaded quickly and there are links to download required plugins.",4

Who would have ever guessed other than an aspiring entrepreneur?The thing that I appreciate the most about this series is the real, down-to-earth approach of each video. There is no hoopla. It is simply a ""This is how we did it"" statement of entrepreneurial activity. These videos could be used to supplement discussions in the online classroom, as a primer for an entrepreneurial activity associated with a course, etc.",4
352,"I've used these videos as an outside of class activity wherein the students watch at least 2 of the videos and provide a WATA (""walk away take away"") Report for each video.  The WATA Report is a 1-2 page document that summarizes the main points of the video and highlights the most impactful element of the content to the student's own life and experiences.  Students seem to enjoy the first person content and hearing about the entrepreneurial experience from the entrepreneurs themselves.   Key themes include: the entrepeneurial mindset, the courage to leap, the challenge of creating something from nothing, the enjoyment of launching new businesses, etc.*I am the curator and editor of this video series.Technical Remarks:The videos are viewed best when using a high speed connection to the internet.  The videos can be paused and reviewed while watching.",5

365,"My main interest in Focusing on Organizational Change is for use in an introductory course on leadership. This interest informs my review, and it is, admittedly, somewhat at odds with the stated aims of the text. In the introduction, the author writes that “[t]his book seeks to assist leaders in building their organizational capacity for change” and that it is “written for any executive who seeks to be more proactive toward change.” However, I find much to recommend this book not only as a primer for those already in a leadership position looking to effect and manage change, but as a solid addition to an undergraduate class on organizational leadership.  
A drawback to the text, for me, is that it does not see itself as the latter. Some minimal changes to wording and structure would, I feel, open up this text to a wider audience. If the lessons within the text are beneficial for those in a leadership position then they are important for those following the leaders and considering leadership roles as well.  
Given its stated audience, it can be excused for not including an introduction to theories of leadership and the broader challenges of leading change that are not the main focus of the book. However, this may be beneficial for even the reader already in a leadership position. Some authors and researchers familiar to those who teach leadership courses (Bennis, Covey, and others) do make their way into the discussion of organizational change, but a brief survey at the start would still be welcomed.  
That said, what the text does cover is vital, and, as I stated before, a welcome addition, especially in this open format, for any course dealing with organizational leadership. Familiar concepts and debates regarding leadership, such the paradoxes inherent in leading, the importance of effective followership, and the distinctions between management and leadership are all covered within the book. Taking as its main focus the need for “ambidextrous” leadership, it is a well-researched and compelling introduction and guide to the challenges of balancing short-term and long-term planning within an organization. The original research that informs the book, especially as regards the “organizational capacity for change,” makes Focusing on Organizational Change a unique offering. Every course needs a place from which to start, and I see this as a valuable touchstone concept around which to build a syllabus.  
In conclusion, although not written specifically with an undergraduate audience in mind, I would still recommend this, in whole or in part, as a primary text for an undergraduate course on leadership. If only considering a smaller section, as an addition to other texts in a course, I suggest Chapter 3 on “Trustworthy Leadership” and Chapter 4 on “Trusting Followers” as good studies on the leader-follower dynamic. Overall, the writing is clear, accessible, and engaging, enriched by a judicious use of anecdote, metaphor, and case studies.",5
366,The concept is a good one to reach the intended target audience and the interactive nature of the lesson is ideal for this population.  Use of various combinations of text and graphics helps to engage the learner of this age and to keep their attention.  I only wish that I was able to experience the actual interactive components but unfortunately the links weren't working for me.  ,4
366,"This powerpoint presentation was excellent!  I found the lesson’s interactive style to be extremely engaging.  Students were given so much control over what they were learning at each step, providing them a level of autonomy.  While there was direct instruction it did not feel like a lecture style presentation.  I also enjoyed all the visual representations, it made the presentation feel alive.  My favorite part of this presentation was the manner in which the quizzes were presented.  During the lesson students were given the opportunity to practice their knowledge before the final test at the end, giving extra opportunity to check their understanding.  But the author also provided specific feedback for the student based upon their answers to these questions.  When a student answers the question incorrectly they are given specific information reminding them of the lesson and why the answer is wrong.  I feel that students can gain a lot from this lesson without much more teacher provided support, which gives students accountability for their learning in a way that blends guidance and independence beautifully.",5

367,"The “Fractal Geometry” Web site on Merlot is fantastic.  I spent about 90 minutes on this site alone – not to mention doing a little reading on my own.  The site starts us off with a review of familiar fractals in nature, art, and architecture.  We learn to spot fractals everywhere from snowflakes to trees. In the introduction alone there is a wealth of information that takes the novice on an intellectual journey through the world of fractals and IFS (iterated function systems).  I appreciate that the Web site starts us from baby steps of exploring self-similarity to more complex concepts and formulas.  To further enhance the teaching and learning features of this site we are given games and art “experiments” to do.  I enjoyed trying the Fractal Paints art/project using paper and a piece of Plexiglas. I found a link to The Dynamical Systems and Technology Project at Boston University http://classes.yale.edu/Fractals/ in which there is a topic called “Chaos, Fractals, and Tom Stoppard’s Play Arcadia” In reading this link and the quotes from the play I was able to gain a much deeper understanding of fractals.  In fact, I even dusted off my copy of Arcadia and found the parts in the book that relate to fractals.  

This site it easy to use with a lot of images and well-broken-down explanations.  Though I found few broken links, I am only disappointed by the lack of a search feature.  There is so much information contained in this Web site that it would be nice to be able to search for the exact information you need.  But ultimately, I think the Fractal Geometry site is a fantastic source for both instructors and students.  It makes a complex subject much more approachable.",5

Function Grapher is an excellent tool for someone who may not be able to afford a graphing calculator or just needs a quick and simple graph.  It is also useful if a student wants to print out a graph to include in an assignment or a paper.  Technical Remarks: The different functions available in Function Grapher are very well defined and clearly available for students to access.  It is also very easy to navigate around the graph and zoom in on specific sections of the graph.

372,"I spent about 30 minutes reviewing and experimenting with the applets available. Most of the simulations model concepts  that I would like to show my students. I wish I had the ones dealing with angles inside circles about a month ago. I would have used them in my lessons. 

I think that these would be best used as a demonstration to spark conversation about concepts. They are not something that my students would use for long periods of time. They are just simple simulations to explore a concept and develop a conclusion.Technical Remarks:The applets are very simple and easy to use. For most of them you just click and drag vertices where you want them.",4
372,i found this site very interesting. i am doing my midterm on the pythagorem theory so this information was very useful to me. Then i looked into the pythagorean triples.  i enjoyed learning the different sets that would produce a right angle.i think this a very interesting tool to have. this is going to help me with my midterm and i will enjoy looking over the rest of these sites.,4
373,A fun instructional activity good for small groups of students. THe material is easy to use and can easily be adapted. The references are somewhat outdated and some data would benefit from references.,4
373,"Very interactive and engaging with good content. I suppose you needed copyright permission to use the voice of the real jeopardy show. It was well done.Technical Remarks:Not sure how to move from clicking on a category on the game board to get back to the game board after answering. Some directions would be useful.  It seemed the only way to go down the ""board"" was in order by paging down.",4

378,"I spent an hour browsing this site.  I am a faculty member who requires my anthropology students to complete written assignments.  I grade the students' grasp of the course material and, although I do not grade their writing mechanics, I do note spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.  Since finding this high-quality site, I expect that I will direct students to it so that they can review particular rules about writing.  In this way, students who desire to improve their writing skills can do so.Technical Remarks: I encountered no technical problems whatsoever when using this site.  Using the index is easier than using the drop-down menus that appear on the home page, although first-time users might like the drop-down menus to orient themselves to the resource.",5
379,This is an excellent resource for students who are confused about doing research. This site helps them find it and evaluate it and more.,4
380,i enjoyed the whole visualization portion of the problem and understood what was asked...the problem was i dont know what all the symbols and other types of things were. Its visualizations and animations such as these that actually get me more interested in the problem rather than conventional teaching.,3
380,"The materials seem interesting but, I don't understand how this is helpful in the real world.Overall, I thought this topic was boring and useless.The content was good and easy to understand,to whomever wants to use it.Who ever wants to learn this, it would be helpful for them.The materials that were being used in here was very well organized and explained.",3
380,"I'm not to familiar with the mathematical terms they had offered. But reading them, I understood when the animation gave me a visualization. I could follow it, without being confused. It was accurate enough for me a first time user, to understand the basic meaning of it. This would be very helpful to students and teachers, it could teach them a lot and benefit them.It never seemed hard for me to understand, this site just offered a easy way to learn. This site was made for first time users,everything is there and its so simple.Technical Remarks:It was interesting to read, and follow along on the animation.",4
380,I thought that this was a good site because it has a lot of pictures and graphs for those people who learn on a visual level. The animation is particularly useful because it let's you see how the activity is applied in real time.Technical Remarks:I was surprised that for a website that uses animation there were no time lags and the load time was quick. The topics were organized in a neat manner as well.,4
380,"a) I basically searched around because it was interesting to me that it was a JAVA applet which illustrated a mathematical analyst of the bouncing of a ball. Other than that I was observing it more and more to figure out what mathematical terms does it relate to.

b) The quality of the content is good because of the graphics and the design of the demonstration of the ball. What caught my attention was the timer or the clock which was used during the demonstration.

c) The effectiveness for teaching is pretty good because the material can be used by an instructor to enrich a lecture or can be assigned to students for individual perusal. It may be used to enhance students' understanding of functions. The height of the bouncing ball, plotted against time, is a series of parabolas. This gives a nice and natural example of a function that analytically must be defined piece-wise. 

d) Using this material was easy because the JAVA applet was self-explanatory and easy to follow. Very good tool for graphic functions and can be used in the category of Calculus.",4
380,"I spent about 20 minutes reviewing the different animation regarding ""How the Ball Bounces"". The quality of the animation was good. The animation showed a ball bouncing with a chart that displayed time, height, and velocity. This representation was then used to show how the values correspond to algebra. I believe the visual element of animation would provide as an effective tool in learning. By connecting the numbers to each bounce of the ball a better understanding can be achieved. The ease of viewing the computer animation cannot be understated. Great visual site.",4
380,"the videos ilusstrating for the problems are in good quality.Technical Remarks:Although it is the matter of Calculus, I find it exciting and amusing. I spent 30 minutes thinking about this problem. I have never though about Mathematics applied in a bouncing ball. With a bouncing ball, people can find the motion equations: one of position, and the other of velocity. Moreover, it is a kind of applied Math in Physics problem: Falling the ball to find the position, velocity, and acceleration, right? I studied all these stuffs in high school, but they have been unreachable for me since then. Now, I understand a little bit. It is a good new, is it not???",4
380,"This animation reminds me the same expriement we did in Astronamy class. The bouncing ball is gradualy slow down, and a stright line finally shows up due to the gravity of the earth. However, if it were in space, then this movement will go forever.",4
380,". How you reviewed the materials (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing, 2 hours trying it, or actually use it in teaching-learning activities?). I spent about 15 mins. at this website and then something happened and my computer crashed.2. The quality of content (Does the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) I found the website to be fun.  It is a great visual tool.  It will help those who learn by doing or learn by seeing.3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning (If used appropriately, will students' learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?) It defintely a effective learning tool for both teacher and student.  I really was having fun with this one and I got to see the graph being made as the ball was bouncing.4. The ease of using the materials (Will first time users find it easy to use the software?) It was quite easy to use until my computer locked up at this site.It really is a fun site.",3
380,"I spent about 5min browsing. This site is a great tool if you are more of a visual learner like myself. The content is great especially the animation where you can actually see how the ball bounces. It seems to be pretty easy to use, but I was wondering if you can customize the models in accordance with a real world setting? it would be intersting to see how a ball bounces within the context of sports like basketball, baseball,ect.",5
380,"As a math student I found this program to be very interesting, especially becasue I remember being frustrated by ""ball bouncing"" problems in my calculus classes. This program Really gives you a realistic real world view of the physics of the bouncing ball.Technical Remarks: I Found the controls at the bottom of the screen hard to understand and use.  Can you speed up the ball? I didn't understand how to manipulate the motion of the ball. A good addition to this program would be a way to add in your own ball bouncing equation so you could actually try the problems given as homework assignments",4
380,I spend 5 min exploring the material of this site and I thought that it was a very good site to go to for children in the 3ed or 4th grade it was very easy to understand how the ball bounces over the per of time and distance it was easy to teach and learn from the marital I thought that the site hade a lovely graphic in it took it one step at a time by showing just with the ball at first and then with the graph lines,4
381,"This site is what I used to learn HTML, and it is fantastic.  Very well written, using a relaxed style.  Walks you right through it.  This is the best online tutorial I have seen so far, and I have seen a bunch. ",5
382,"In reading the licensing information, I immediately saw a sentence that contained a comma splice. This makes me question the quality of the site contents.",2

384,"Some time ago I attempted to have students use some of the treaties and accompanying maps in a paper I assigned in a 200-level American Minorities History class.  I discovered that the students did not have the skills to put together the information from the primary sources with the information they were reading about Indian removal in their textbook.  Since the same students were able to use other types of primary sources effectively, I concluded that the nature of the source was too difficult for that level of student to use without considerable help from me.",2
384,Very detailed description of pertinent information in hundreds of treaties and agreements between the U.S. government and Native Americans.  An excellent resource for research.,4
385,Great organization and information.  I found the exercises to be a bit too wordy and possibly overwhelming for students.,3
385,"The thing i like about this site is the way they've come up with probability problems for you. There are 41 of them to give someone an idea of what it's about. They really test your mind with it. Once you get it, its pretty cool. In the intro, they give you an welcoming into the theory of probability and how it works. I was never good with it, but now i think this site can help me and others out greatly.",4
385,Good site. But you'll have to explain how to use it more than once!!!!Technical Remarks:Confusing at first.,5
385,"Perhaps I'm a little hard to learn when it comes to math and require a bit more explanation/information/examples but compared to the finite math site, this site didn't seem to have as much information as I would have liked.  It's definately a useful tool to know about and have handy.  The examples and explanations they have on the site was definately helpful.  I did enjoy the quote posted...Lord J.M. Keynes ""... it is not rational for us to believe that the probable is true.""Technical Remarks:On a technical note...It would be nice to click on links that opened up a seperate window as oppose to clicking the back button everytime to reference the previous materials.",4
385,"What exactly are you doing when your finding patterns that occur in random events? Youre finding the probability of that event happening. Many students find probability very difficult to understand. Like other students, I was one of them. This site can clear many questions you may have about probability. It provides exercises to help students gain a better insight on how to answer problems. Some questions like Balls of Color, allow you to think the questions without the solution being revealed. It allows you to soak in the information and gives lots of room for critical thinking and application. The site is very well organized and is filled with quality problems to help study for exams. I found this site to be very helpful, and hope others enjoy it just as much as I did.",5
385,"I spent about one hour reviewing this site. This site contains an excellent educational and fun information. I like this quote ""In a world as crazy as this one, it ought to be easy to find something that happens solely by chance. It isn't"". Also, i learned what is the probality? Intuitively, the mathematical theory of probability deals with patterns that occur in random events. Problability problem #9 Birthday Coincidence..... I found it to be interesting. I'm sure students and professor really enjoy this site because the quality of the material was great and well organized.Technical Remarks:I think that first time users will find it easy to go through this website and try a variety of problems.",4
385,"I chose this article because I want to learn more and understand about probability. Before I read this article, I always have in my mind that probability means 50% of change to be right when we guess a prediction. I like this article because describes about what probability means. One the things I like this article is that it has problems so we can practice and understand more about probability, and it has the solutions for each problem which it explains step by step. This is a great way to practice about probability.  I read some problems to understand more about the subject. One of the problems that I like most and it explained more clearly and simple was the bear cubs problem.  This problem helped me to understand more about probability since I am studying this subject in my class. I spend less than an hour searching learning about this subject. The article goes straight to the main point which is useful for the students who want to learn more about the probability problems. I didnt have any problem to understand this subject because it has the basic vocabulary to explain the main idea.",5
385,"I reviewed this material extensively in planning a lesson for my remedial ninth grade math class.  After reviewing several of the available problems, I selected the Monty Hall problem to be the focus of my lesson.  While I have not actually used the lesson yet with my students, I plan to in the next few weeks.  The quality of the content is very high.  I appreciated the variety of classic probability problems that were presented in such a manner that they would be accessible to high school students but also engaging for college students or adults as well.  The written descriptions of the problems are informative and thorough and the simulations are engaging.  I am extremely optimistic that this resource will be able to be used effectively to help my students understand the use of simulations in solving probability problems.  Technical Remarks: I found this online resource easy to use and navigate.  Despite warnings that some computers may have trouble running the simulations, I had no technical difficulties whatsoever in running the simulations on my home computer and I also no problems running them on the computers at work.  One change that might make the Monty Hall simulation easier to understand would be to change the program for the applet to open one door at a time more like it was described on the show Let's Make a Deal.",4
385,"This sit was awsome.  I love probability, and it was very easy to follow all the information on this sit.  There were great problems that you can try and solve, and there were great examples as well.  I spent about 15 minutes on this sit and I was able to absorb a ton of infromation.  This was a great sit, and it was very educational.",4
385,"I have always been interested in probability simply because I like knowing the odds that an event or action will occur. I have always been fascinated about how mathematicians as well as many other people are able to break down statistics and determine the probability of an event. A main theme that this particular site demonstrated quite well was the portion that determined random selection. There was a very easy to understand example of this idea on the website. Through playing around with the example I was able to understand a lot more about the process of random selection. Through this example as well as a few others listed on the page I was able to determine that the process of random selection includes no selection at all. I kept going back and forth from this site because I couldn?t stop playing with the random selection example shown on the site. This site was particularly easy to navigate around in but it did leave a few areas about the topic uncovered. But because of the simplicity of the web site and the great examples, this site is definitely a valuable learning tool.http://www.cut-the-knot.org/probability.shtml",4
385,"The site had points of probility examples, but had miused statics and application to biology. The material was equally distrubuted to a lot of puzzle solving. Which made a little exciting to solve. Technical Remarks: The website was a good learning tool if you get into statics. ",3
385,"I really like this web-site.  This site on Probability briefly decribes probability as well as intoduces 21 probaility problems; each problem is laid out in detail and allow you to work out the problem, once you have reached the solution to the problem it allows you to check your answer.  The part I like the most is the site shows you the steps in solving the problem. I believe this is a great learning tool.  I find many sites just give you the answer but they don't show you the steps in solving the problem.  This site clearly shows you the steps which is helpful. I spent about 1 hour in this site visiting differnt probability problems, like the probability of The Male and Female Bears, The Monty Hall Dilemma and The Balls of Two Colors.  I believe this is a good site for the students.  The site is laid out in a simple format which makes it easy to undertand as well as use. It is not diffcult to meneuver your way through the site.  It is user friendly.  ",4

Lecture notes, high-quality (color) pictures, and quicktime videos of viral replication are provided.  Links for current issues in the news are also provided.",5
406,"﻿This site can be extremely useful for a new or experienced teacher. The ""How to Teach section"" isa user-friendly guide for teachers offering both teaching tips and ideas. In addition, the ""What toTeach section"" offers the teacher a listing of great poems to teach that have been collected by theTeachers and Writer Collaborative, along with 100 best poems to memorize. The Teacher Forumis a very interesting area which includes threaded discussions on teaching methodology. TheTeacher Research Center is also a valuable resource as it includes links to litservs, tools,conferences& festivals, and poetry curricula.Technical Remarks: ﻿The layout and design of the site will be familiar to most savvy Internet users. The screens areeasy to read and to navigate. The icons on the opening page are appealing and logical to the user.The site has good use of color that helps to guide the user to various links. The use of color isconsistent throughout the pages and the poems are in a large font that makes it easy to read. Theuser also has the option to view information in text only and larger text. There is a built in helpfeature on the site that guides you through the site. Problems did occur when trying to use the audio and video links, although no error messages everappeared. The site should provide you with its technical requirements.",4
407,"This is a lesson that definitely has a need in high school, and introducing students to finding good and reliable resources.  So many times students will cite sources that haven't been vetted completely, and that can lead to some issues.  I like how the lesson gives the students motivation to research so that they can be more accurate in their discussions, which will make them want to have better sources.  It might be good to have some samples ready of sources that look good at first, but tun out to be rather misleading or incorrect after researching the source.",5
407,This is a much-needed lesson topic for students.  They tend to blindly trust everything they find on the internet.  I printed the evaluation sheet and the research paper rubric.  They will both be useful for middle school language arts.  My only suggestion would be to include a topic for the research paper.  I am interested to know what topic you will be using with this lesson. ,5
407,"The grade level range for this lesson plan was from middle school to general ed college level.  However, it would not be appropriate beyond 10th grade due to its simplicity and likelihood of offending students. College students, even at county colleges, prefer not to work in groups to determine the validity/reliability of online sources. First, it would waste precious instructional time. Secondly, college frosh have so many other adjustments to make, to use this exercsie would be akin to letting the blind lead the blind. Instead, I have found it helpful to give students a few general rules: don't use Wikipedia, for it is unrelaible (and I explain why), always use scholarly sources usually ending in .edu/.org, or sleect from various sources the college subscribes to such as JOLT. LION, etc. This is after I help students narrow down their research focus through conferences. The next step is small group work where students discuss each other's sources, article printouts (and/or book abstracts), and help each otehr determine which ones to use or discard. These steps give students ownership, and, since it's accomplished through allotted chunks of time during a few class periods, students have given the project much thought. This process has worked for my students for several years with minimal waste of time and effort.",3
408,Very nice simulation to use when the school doesn't have a good collection of optics equipment.  The students like the interchangeability of the features.  The screen is a bit small but it is workable. It is also good to use in lecture as a demonstration.,5
408,A very useful applet to visualize ray diagrams for lenses and mirrors. Useful as a teaching aid or for study or reference.,5
408,"Outstanding applet, with a lot of user interactivity. I wish the viewing area was larger, however.",5
409,I have assigned this activity to great effect in my asynchronous online class. Students submitted digital photographs of the finished product as well as intermediate stages. ,5
410,Great tool for 'newbies' to networking technologies and would be perfect for intro networking students to help reinforce purpose and functions of OSI model by layers.,5
410,"I really like this quiz. It tells you if you are correct or incorrect as soon as you click on an answer; and it stays on the page, allowing you to try other answers, or go on to the next question. Very good to use in a face-to-face class to break up the monotony of a lecture.",5
410,"It's nice to find a site where an actual quiz exists on a networking topic.  The questions are understandable and the answers are given immediately so students will have immediate feedback.  The only problem is there is no tutorial that goes with this, which would be a plus. This would be a good review for students after the OSI model is covered in class.",5
410,Spent about six minutes answering questions. Good site to test overall knowledge of the OSI model. I also liked the pop-up window for answering right and wrong answers.,5
410,This site is a good way to quiz yourself on the OSI model. Extremely helpful to take before a test.,5
410,Very nice way to quiz yourself on the OSI model.  Also other infomation about certifications on this site.,4
410,Good coverage of the OSI model. Useful tool in studying the OSI model.,4
410,"This is a good site to use to study on the OSI model.There is also comprehensive info about what companies offer which certifications, how much they cost, requirements, etc...",4
411,"I like how the site is interactive. A student is prompted about what to put in, the system records it and then asks another question or gives feedback. The student is learning through doing.",4
411,"I composed a sample paragraph in this software and I liked it. There were a few things I had to know about using this software, but I was able to figure them out fairly quickly on my own. I like that the paragraphing is thorough--students must work through something like 10 different processes in order to complete a paragraph in this software. The downside to this resource is that it costs money to use. It would be wonderful if this product were made available for free use, especially if it provides a benefit to student writers.",4
412,"The Particle Adventure is an incredible ride!!  It is a journey that begins with an atom and ends by giving you a complete understanding of particle physics and the standard model.  Each facet of the theory is explained simply, yet elegantly such that it can be understood by a physics novice or phd.  	The beauty of this web site is that it assumes that you have absolutely no previous knowledge about particle physics, so it explains step by step the various particles and interactions.  In addition it provides the logic behind the theories and some evidence of experimental confirmation of the theories.  The end result is a well-organized, well-explained site that does not ""dummy down"" the information.  The combination of this, and the wonderful sense of humor thrown in by the author(s) yields a fun, and informative adventure.  By the time you are throug exploring this site you will have a complete understanding of the subatomic particles, and the forces that mediate their interactions.  This allows you to understand why science has adopted the theories that it currently holds, and where physicists can go from there.	The site is a little long, but as I have mentioned it is well worth it, so pack a sandwich, get comfortable and prepair to embark on a tour of the subatomic world.",5
412,"If you are looking for a description and history of every major discovery in atomic and subatomic physics for the last century this sight is for you.  The majority of the sight is set up in a tour format, and includes everything from radioactivity to annihilation to a brief description of quantum mechanics.  All descriptions are qualitative and assume no prior knowledge of physics or math, yet still manage to be relatively satisfying.  My favorite feature is that the welcome and home pages both contain links to several articles on current research in the field.  Once you have developed some sense of the subject by reading through the body of the sight you can come back and read about some of the most recent developments in more depth.The only complaint I could think of is about the format.  The particle adventure is a lengthy one (I lost count after, 2 hours and 50 pages) and it would be nice to have a linked index on, or linked to the homepage, in addition to the back/forward arrows on each screen.  This is however a small issue and should by no means dissuade anyone from visiting this sight.  Overall it is a very informative and well constructed sight.Technical Remarks: It is apparent from the start that a lot of time and skill went into the construction of this sight.  The page layout is aesthetically appealing and there are several interesting Java script animations.  I found that the page layout was more than a little cramped when viewed with Netscape 6.0, though older versions of Netscape seemed to work perfectly.",5
412,"This comprehensive and interactive tutorial serves not only as an introduction to the types and characteristics of the fundamental particles in nature but also as a primer for experimental methods relating to particle physics. A moderately fast reading of Michael Barnett's particle Adventure requires about three hours of one's time. The tutorial begins with a presentation of the types and characteristics of the most fundamental particles that comprise the Standard Model. The presentation includes a discussion of every known fundamental particle of nature including the matter and anti-matter particles such as quarks and leptons as well as the force-interaction type particles such as photons, gluons, and the hypothetical graviton.     Quizzes appear at the end of most of the major sections of Barnett's tutorial allowing one to test his/her understanding of the preceding material. In addition, Barnett has scattered bits of particle physics trivia and comic relief throughout the adventure keeping the tutorial fresh and human. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions.     For persons such as myself who have some basic prior knowledge of the types and characteristics of the different fundamental particles, perhaps the most appealing aspect of Barnett's tutorial are the sections on experimental design and technique. Many undergraduate physics majors have little opportunity to familiarize themselves with experimental methods associated with particle physics experimentation and particle acceleration.The latter portion of the tutorial addresses such topics. These include basic experimental design, different types of particle accelerators, the major accelerators used around the world today and their respective discoveries,
 and the acquistion and interpretation of data. Thus, Barnett's tutorial is successful in removing the mysteries associated with high energy physics.Technical Remarks:I recommend downloading the Macromedia setup that allows one to scroll through the table of contents. This facilitates movement throughout the tutorial as without the table of contents, one's movement throughout the adventure is limited to one page at a time.",5
412,"After having spent roughly three hours going through every page of the particle adventure, I have to take my hat off to Michael Barnett and company at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories.  They have managed to create an interesting and informative introduction to particle physics with much humor and virtually no math.  The Standard Model is run through as thoroughly as a newcomer can possibly absorb in an inital dose.  From leptons to hadrons, fermions to bosons, photons to gluons, all of the ""major"" particles are covered in this adventure.  The four interactions (3!?) are also discussed plainly and clearly, as are particle decays and the machines that humanity has constructed to study them.The multitude of usually funny cartoons keeps the mood decidedly upbeat.  Things do occasionally get a little Sesame Street-like (I cite the ?mu-on Lion? and the ?tau tiger?) in an attempt to keep things lighthearted.  I understand and appreciate the effort to keep things simple, but it could only improve the educational value of the site if more of the links offered some advanced coverage of the material--though I am sure that hand-waving is probably the only viable teaching technique available to the particle physicist at this level.Reviewing this site for a junior level modern physics course at Humboldt State University, this is the first study of particle physics I have ever undertaken (apart from blazing through a copy of the ""Tao of Physics"").  I learned a lot from my paticle adventure, although some of the material covered will keep me scratching my head for a long time to come. Technical Remarks: I found the site very easy to manage.  I do wish there were a set of next/previous page buttons at the bottom of the pages so that I didn?t have to keep scrolling back to the top, but that is a minor point.  ",5
412,"Anyone interested in particle physics should visit this site.  Professionally done, and very thorough.",5
413,"This Flash presentation is a fun way for students to play with the principles of classical conditioning with a virtual dog.  However, I think it would be important to review the concepts first, before introducing the learning object.  Otherwise, students may become frustrated by the lack of instructions with the material.Technical Remarks:Very easy to use, but you must have Flash.",5
413,"I found this learning object to be very helpful in teaching classical conditioning and learning. A student actually referred it to me and I have since used it as supportive learning material in my course. I think it is provides good quality content, is an effective tool, is easy to use, and is fun!Technical Remarks:Need Flash 6",5
414,I inadvertently gave the site only three stars in my previous comment.,5
415,"There is a lot of helpful information, essential components for teachers teaching physical science on this site. The material provided, from reading materials, videos and virtual practice lab samples are very useful for teachers learning how to teach the material – physical science. I especially like how the site breaks down the components into 8 different sections, as one enhance previous concepts. ",4
416,Very fun and interesting way to work on French vocabulary and grammar. I liked also how I was able to work at my own language proficiency level in the crime mysteries. ,5
416,What a fun way to build vocabulary and practice  your grammar skills.  An engaging and absorbing site for all levels of proficiency.,5
416,This site was a lot of fun and very useful.  I worked through the whole thing at the easiest level.  The mouseover pictures and other vocabulary and grammar features were also very useful.  I learned a lot from this site and it was very easy to use.  Thanks.Technical Remarks: No problems and the site was well coded.,5
416,Very nice site.  Great way to test your level of French in an interesting and interactive format.  Like a French Carmen San Diego.,5
417,"I spent several hours reviewing and navigating through this learning object. The Probe the Brain section was very educational. This site provides information and diagrams of the brain and the motor cortex. This site also provides background history of the researchers and their experiments which were conducted in order to discover of how the brain functions. The Probe the Brain activity provides an interactive tool which allows individuals to discover the different functions of the brain. 
Probe the Brain can offer a wonderful educational experience for students. This site enables students to learn about the brain and the motor cortex in an enjoyable interactive format. With the background information, diagrams, and stimulation, this section provides a comprehensive and engaging learning activity for all learners.Technical Remarks:Probe the Brain section was very easy to navigate. The hyperlinks in the site were clearly marked and functional. The Probe the Brain activity had easy step by step instructions that were easy to understand and follow.",5
418,"This site employs relevant, engaging, and meaningful lesson plans and materials. The site also employs interactive teaching tools to encourage collaborative learning.Technical Remarks:Users will need the current flashplayer to utlize many of the interactive tools, but the site is easy to navigate.",5
418,I like some of the information presented and will be looking at using it in one of my courses along with adding to an online component.Technical Remarks:A fill-in version of some of the documents would be recommended for online students.,4
418,"NCTM has created a wonderful resource for teachers and students.  There are lesson plans, interactive games and opportunities for learning for both in-service and pre-service teachers as well as their students.  Take a look at this one!",4
419,This is a great resource. I asks students to use descriptions of the planets to put them in order. It is a good way for students to learn about the planets as well as meet language arts standards such as ordering. I think students would be very excited to try this out. The only real problem I see is that it might be difficult to monitor students learning during this process.Technical Remarks:This site was very easy to use and understand.,4
420,"I use “The Road to Research” for an introductory course in educational technology research.  The visual of the road, with signposts, supports the short text description.  This simple visual explanation of the elements required in the research process is perfectly designed for graduate students in an introductory research course.",4
420,"Good adjunct to the physical text book. The student is advised to enroll in an class that uses the text, and use this learning material (website) to enhance the learning experience.Technical Remarks:Easy navigation; easy on the eyes.",4
421,This resources looks like it would be good to familiarize students regarding the history of race in a Sociology of Race and Ethnicity course. One limitation is that it focuses only on race rather than also ethnicity. I would also like to see this formatted as a PowerPoint. My preferences is to keep students within the learning management system rather than sending them to external websites. I like to reduce the number of clicks to accomplish course work and I think an embedded PowerPoint would do the trick. I would also like to see the website updated to reflect on the election of Obama and how his racial background challenges and reinforces our understanding of race.,4
421,This is an interactive lesson on the history and social construction of race. The activity requires basic computer skills for navigating the self-paced presentation and completing the assessment. The material is appropriate for introductory courses including social problems and upper division courses on race and ethnicity. The presentation provides a thorough overview on the evolution of race as a categorical marker in society. This exercise gives students a foundation about the complexity about how personal truths develop into socially accepted facts that set boundaries for social life. The activity may be assigned as an individual exercise or completed with the entire class as a basis for discussion or lecture.,4
421,"This is an informative site that offers various disciplinary perspectives on race throughout time. The interactive elements are fun and effective for breaking up what would otherwise be a text-heavy module. I would have liked more opportunities for interactive exercises that allowed users to ""test"" the information they just read. This would be a good resource to integrate into any introductory sociology course or course on the sociology of race.Technical Remarks:Some of the links in the presentation are broken/cannot be displayed.",4
421,"I found this site to be unique and FUN. These facts were different than the traditional diversity numbers and statistics. I didn't check the facts and one multiple choice question was not answered but I will check the history, science, etc. books. This is a great presentation form to emulate.While this wasn't a comprehensive site or module it was a useful resource. It may be better presented as a sub site.",4
421,"I found this information historically correct and enjoyed the inclusion of relevant pieces of information to support the learning objectives. What some might find troubling is the use of Wikipedia links provided to support various factual details. For those who teach ethnicity concepts; the concluding definitions of race perpetuate the misconception that race an ethnicity are the same. 

As a Cultural Diversity teacher I will use some of the historical material provided within the modules particularly the recommended links derived from pbs.Technical Remarks:Easy to use and flexible",4
422,"Overall, this is a very useful introduction to Boolean operators and could be great either for introducing students to the concept for the first time or as a review for students who may be struggling. The illustrative examples are very clear and I think would help studentss wrap their head around the AND, OR, NOT concepts.Since this tutorial was submitted to MERLOT nearly 6 years ago, it'd be great to see a new version with updated screen shots and perhaps a non-Flash version that would be more compatible with mobile viewing.",4
422,"Member Status - Content DeveloperUsage - I have not personally used this tutorial, but I have created tutorials discussing similar content.Ease of Use - Found the tutorial very easy to navigate, instructions are simple and easy to follow.Prior Use - As a former librarian I am very familiar with the topic area, both personally and professionally when using databases for research.Accuracy of Content - Found this content to be accurate and reliable.Technical Remarks:Suggestions:Overall I found this to be a very good tutorial and useful for anyone desiring to understand the concept of Boolean searching / operators.I would however redesign the tutorial with up-to-date screenshots, and replace the outdated graphics with more modern icons and pics.Finally, a link to allow users to download a printed (pdf) version of the tutorial.",4
422,"This tutorial is just right for the ""Introduction to Boolean Searching"" segment in my information literacy classes.  The language is clear enough and the scope is great for college freshmen.",4
422,This tutorial provides users with a guided simulation of Boolean Searching.  It is simple and straightforward.  This tutorial is an outstanding example of how to teach this type of search.  I feel it can be used as a very effective teaching tool.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash player.  ,5
422,I loved that this was interactive; it's great guided practice after the concept of Boolean has been introduced.,4
422,Very easy to understand tutorial on basic Boolean operators. Examples were clear and helpful.  Simple explanation and does not require much time to complete.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate. Flash elements worked well.  Nothing was confusing.,4
423,This is a fairly easy to use government website that explains many of the legal requirements of small businesses. This is a great resource to include in my Intro to Business Law course where students similate creating a small business.,4
424,Excellent demonstration of the basic definition of social networking.  The downside to the learning tool is that it is slightly outdated.  Crafted in 2007 it references MySpace which is not really a name brand social network anymore.  Having said that it doesn't discount the accurate definition of social networking.  It will definitely appeal to those who aren't techy-techs as there isn't a lot of jargon/lingo that would overwhelm.  Given the speed at which social networking tools are growing it might be worthwhile to revise to include the different varieties of tools. Technical Remarks:I accessed the video from a Firefox browser on a Mac running OS 10.8.2 with no problem.  The video streamed via You Tube with no problem.  I could see where there might be issue with schools (primarily K-12) who filter access to the site.  You may not have as many viewers in that area as a result.,3
425,This is a great resource for psychology and sociology instructors. There is plenty of information to read.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate.,3
425,"This website is a collection of so-so lecture/presentation materials focusing on social psychology.  There are many links that provide further amount of information.  While the content itself is ok, the effectiveness as a teaching tool is limited in my perspective because much of this posted information is fairly old and could provide a lot more information in general.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate but must read through the entire website to do so.",3
425,"I spent about 10 minutes going over the information in this collection. Although it has a wealth of information, it is a little wordy to be used in a classroom. Students also would probably not be willing to read through this all. It would be more useful to pull specific topics out and possibly have a discussion over one of the topics vs. the whole website.Technical Remarks:Very easy to use. There is a homepage with a table of contents of the material. You can then click to the links which will bring up that topic. Each section also has links that define ambiguous words and direct you to books and other links under that topic.",3
425,"I spent 20 minutes reading this article. I first skimmed through it, then read it thoroughly through a second time. I feel that this article was easy to comprehend; a first-time reader (such as myself) would have no problem understanding the wording and language used. I think this would be a good article to use in the classroom for this reason. The outline given at the end is also nice and easy to understand.",5
425,I spent 10 minutes in awe of how convenient this website is for those interested in social psychology.  Everything in this website is beneficial in knowing more about social psychology.  Every link teaches something to whoever looks at it.  I truly believe that students' learning and faculty's teaching will be enhanced because of how much explanation this website has concerning the subject. First time users will find this software easy and very well organized.  It comes with an outline that explains Social psychology thoroughly.,5
426,This is a site that gradually takes you through the process. I think that it is pretty good. I dislike all of the extra advertising because it can make you become unfocused.Technical Remarks: The error detection process needs to be worked on more so that anyone visiting the site will be able to correct their problems.,3
427,This is a whole website. I was unable to locate the movie referenced in Merlot. There is a full curriculum you can purchase for $4.95. There are a number of podcasts that do appear to be free. Overall it is a useful resource if you are trying to create a learning module. It appeared to be most appropriate for a middle to junior high school audience.,3
427,"The animation was great.  The video can be used for different subject areas (e.g. economics, manufacturing, environmental studies, etc.).  The material is appropriate for target audience; it can also be used for elementary and middle school students.  I like that there is a questionnaire at the end.  The only thing I would recommend is to try to keep the video to 5 minutes or less because of people's attention span.",4
427,"On its own this video is absolute garbage. Anyone with a modest grasp of economics will cringe at Leonard's unsatisfactory analysis.Pros: Great production value, compelling presentation, and well known outside economics department (i.e. allows students to reach outside of their discipline while on campus).Cons: Overrun with economic fallacies and poor analysis.Recommended use: This video could be used to teach students about rhetoric, and how to write about economic issues. Debunking this video provides almost endless possibilities for student op-eds. I wouldn't recommend using this in a principles class, but in an upper division class with a talented lecturer, it could be torn apart in class.",1
427,"This animation is superb. The Story of Stuff is an interesting view on rampant consumerism and its adverse effects on our environment and us. The animation was grabbing, witty and highly entertaining which will keep students attention. The information is broken down into bite-sized information that is easy to digest; the scenario is presented in amusing caricatures that effectively gets its point across, notwithstanding the serious theme at hand. It runs through the whole cycle of the materials economy from extraction, production, distribution, consumption and disposal. The video zooms in on our current predicament brought about by the long-term effects of the ridiculous rate that we buy and dispose our stuff. The presentation is excellent for classroom use.Technical Remarks:None",5
428,"I liked how the case was laid out, it was extremely user friendly for the classroom. The format allowed for strategic pauses and opportunities to engage the students in discussion. The details and information provided a solid foundation of information in order for the students to engage in an intelligent dialogue.",4
429,"Excellent layout and organization to site - consistency makes it easily navigable.  There are some broken links, which is a shame, as it looks like it was last updated in 2004.  Some simple edits wouldbring the site up to date.  Because it is meant to be used as supplementary material there is not a lot of background information or historical context. Therefore, an instructor would need to provide some foundational information and/or knowledge-building excercises before letting the students navigate this site on their own.  
The organization of the site could arguably be used as a template for student projects - this would build on an already excellent site.  It could even be adapted to different topics/areas in history.
This learning material could be used as a whole as it is designed (for a larger survey course) or for more specific courses like slavery in the US, Women's Rights, or a focus on the 19th century for example.  
Some of the best elements are: 1)the detailed images with hotspots that direct the viewer's attention to detail, 2) the questions for each topic, and 3) the emphasis on the use of evidence when making claims about history.",5
429,"""Survey of U.S. History"" is designed to accompany a 100-level U.S. history course, and offers 27 exercises that deepen student's engament with 17th- through 20th-century North American history. The emphasis is mostly on 19th- and 20th century history, and the exercises devote much attention to cultural representations of the past (art, music, television).The exercises prompt students to think about a series of written and visual primary sources available on the website. In these exercises students engage both contextual and interpretive questions that form an excellent basis for class discussion. Moreover, ""Survey of U.S. History"" invites students to explore some well-known events (such as the Boston Massacre), but also experiences and themes that might be less familiar to students: the lives of indentured servants in the 17th century, Native American creation stories, and 19th-century anti-immigration cartoons. One particular exercise prompts students to draw out their own vision of a utopian community during Jackson's presidency.""Survey of U.S. History"" offers plenty of usable case studies for U.S. history survey classes, as well as a good model for how to integrate primary source analysis into a class syllabus.Technical Remarks:The presentation is basic but well-organized, functional, and easy to navigate.",4
430,"This is a great tutorial for students to learn about sustainable agriculture.  The objectives are listed at the beginning of every lesson and very relevent to today's evironmental issues in agriculture.  The students enjoyed some of the activities in the lessons, but as a teacher you will need to pick and choose which activities you use.  The links and case studies in this unit are excellent.",5
431,The links are particularly useful for providing students with background information when preparing for complex literary topics discussed in lectures and seminars. I have used many of the resources on French civilization and culture in my own courses.,5
431,I found this website to be extremely helpful for use in my online french course. The website is easy to get around on and is full of interesting useful information. I would recommend it to any french student. I believe that by using this website a student can enhance their ability to learn the french language and culture.,4
431,"Iv'e used this site previously when I was looking for a study help for learning French. I found it to be very informative. If I had to offer any criticism, it would be of the color scheme. It's a bit loud for my taste.Technical Remarks: The site was easy to navigate and the informational offerings were  sufficient to give someone unfamiliar with French culture some idea of the richness and diversity of the French. ",4
431,I used this site very often for my French class this semester and I found it extremely helpful.  I went to almost every link from this page and not all of them were helpful and some were repetitive but I could find everything I needed to help me with French.,5
431,"This is a great site!  I could get lost in all the beautifully done links listed here.  A great site I found was ""France la Pittoresque"".  Beautiful pictures and a fantastic link from there to French Legends.  I can't understand quite all of it yet but I will one day! :)Technical Remarks: Super easy site to get around in!",5
431,Excellent site to use to find information on a multitude of subjects pertaining to France and the french language. It also gives you links where you can hear french language tv and radio broadcasts and see french language newspapers and articles.,5
432,"A wonderful site complete with clear explanations of grammar concepts, audio clips allowing students to hear the pronunciation and use of each word in context, and helpful review exercises! Great for university 101 language classes, and I would also refer upper level French students to the site to work on specific problem areas that they might have.Technical Remarks:Site is very user friendly.",5
432,"I have used this resource at both the beginning and intermediate levels. Students are immediately drawn into the humorous, but very efficient presentation of the grammar points. In classes where a natural language approach is used, students frequently seek a concise, English language resource outside of class. Tex's grammar fulfills that need.Technical Remarks:The site is extremely straightforward and has a clear navigational scheme. The credits page shows that a large design team had input on this project. The site index and search features are very useful.",5
432,"I personally did not use this site in my french course however I believe that it would have been helpful in the beginning. I would recommend that a beginning french student would use this website for review of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, etc. The site appears to be easy to get around as well.",3
433,"This site has great information on HIV and immunology topics.  The spread of HIV wasn't working when I tried it, but the HIV information was complete, thorough and included questions at the end to test student's knowledge.  The ELISA animations were a bit too fast and not explained very well, but would nicely supplement a class discussion.",4
434,"I really liked this website. It was incredibly easy to use, and had a lot of information. I learned a lot just from the first page. Their are so many links that you can go just about anywhere.Technical Remarks: This website was set up really nicely. I was able to navigate it easily and find waht i was looking for.",4
434,"1. I spent about half an hour looking through the material in this site and what it has to offer. I was particularly interested in the children with autism section. 2.The content appears to be very thorough and in great detail.3.I belive it has the potential to be very educational, especially for parents and students learning abour behavioral disorders.4. I blieve it may be somewhat confusing for first time users at first, but if they tke their time and browse through the site, they should have no problem once they get started.",4
434,This site was one I wish educators today would consider reading.  PSI would help students to achive.  They would succeed where they have failed.  Teachers would teach.I spent some time reading the information about PSI.  Technical Remarks: I was able to explore easily.  ,4
434,I spent about 2 hours reading material on this site. I found the information to be informative and plentiful. This site is a very useful tool for both teachers and students. There are multiple links to all kinds of sources. Technical Remarks: The site is very easy to navigate. First time users will find this site well laid out and instructional. ,5
434,"I reviewed the website by spending approximately an hour reading through the materials in several sections that interested me. I found the information to be soundly based on concepts that were consistent with the principles that have been learned in previous courses and will return to it to read other material in full. I think the website has a high potential for enhancing teaching and learning due to its straightforward discussion, not leaving a layperson confused with technical discussion or terms. The site itself was easy to manuver around and well laid out.  ",5
434,"I'm pleased to have found this website for many reason, mostly to learn in all areas of interest to me. This has helped me with several research papers.",5
434,"I spent around fourty-five minutes reading through several links of this site. The information given on behavior appears to be first rate. I feel this site has good educational potential. With the examples given, there is an understanding of the effectiveness of their techniques used. This site touches on a broad range of topics concerning the many facets of behavior.

434,I found this site very informative.  There is a wide range of topics from autism to parenting. this site is a good site for resources. It also has links to other sites.  Technical Remarks: This site was very easy to navigate and easy to understand.,5
435,"1)  I reviewed the materials for about 20 minutes.  I did not use them in teaching-learning activities.2)  I liked the quality of content.  The plot and character summaries would work well as pre-viewing activities in an advanced ESL setting.  I would probably highlight certain vocabulary/expressions in the section on the site that clarifies difficult concepts or expressions.  I would not want to overwhelm the students with too much new vocabulary/expressions.  Although the slang/expressions in the movie I reviewed (My Big Fat Greek Wedding)were great, as were the cultural similarities between Orthodox Greek families and large Latino families.  As I plan on teaching Latino's, I think this movie would really interest them.  They could relate to the Greek family dynamic as it parallels Latino families in many ways.4)  Aside from some frustrations logging-in, I found the website pretty easy to navigate.  Those not very computer savvy might not feel the same way.",4
436,"This is a great web site to find resources in listening,grammar,etc.  I like that it even has links to other great resources for teachers and learners.",4
436,A great tool for teachers teaching refresher college courses.  This link gives helpful activities to engage undiagnosed learning disabled students.,5
437,"The IRIS Center is a wonderful resource for teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  I teach in the Departments of Child & Family Development, as well as Special Education, and there is a wealth of content that is applicable in both fields.  I have been successful in finding content that aligns nicely with my courses current learning outcomes, and have found wonderful resources which allow me to expand my learning outcomes as well.  
In particular, I have utilized the Collaboration, Disability, Diversity, and Early Intervention/Early Childhood IRIS Resource Topics.  Each IRIS Resource Topic contains a myriad of modules, activities, videos, information briefs, and more.  I have found it useful to both assign an entire module, and have also had success picking and choosing individual resources to embed into existing lectures.   
I appreciate that the IRIS Center has a focus on evidence-based practices (EBPs).  Utilizing EBPs is something I stress with my students; IRIS not only focuses on them, but it provides students with link and outlets to find out more information on the topics as well. Furthermore, it does so while using clear and consistent terminology, which will be important as the students enter their professional lives.  
Another feature I appreciate is the IRIS Center’s simple navigation.  The content is well organized; each module includes a Wrap-Around Concept Map, which organizes the material within the module and also directs the user toward related modules.  As an instructor this helps me identify other useful content to assign, and for curious students, it would allow them to easily find more information on their own time.  
From an editorial perspective, IRIS is very well designed.  The content is well written and free of grammatical error.  Additionally, the graphics and animations are visually appealing and well organized.  
In assigning the IRIS modules to students, I have only received positive feedback.  The students report it is easy to access and navigate, and that the time estimates given are relatively accurate.  While much of the content is only accessed online, there are options to print many of the resources as pdfs.  It is also nice that many of the videos provide the option of viewing a transcript.   
I will continue to incorporate content from the IRIS Center into my courses, and am grateful such a wonderful, free, resource exists for students and educators to benefit from.  I hope more instructors will take advantage of all it has to offer as well.",5
438,This is an excellent overview of the Johari Window. Downloadable diagrams are available in addition to complementary material.Technical Remarks:The site seems to be fully functional and easy to navigate.,4

Finally, this website is highly recommended for students, researchers, instructors, and other people interested in leaning mathematical sciences.",5
439,"Looking at this link, I felt overwhelmed the first time, as I continue browsing I realized that this is a helpful link for math students. It gives valuable and tons of information.They offer interactive tools for better comprehension and for learning Math more enjoyable",4
439,"I spent about a half an hour reviewing this forum and found it pretty comphrehensive. 
 They have all kinds of interactive programs to tackle a variety of math, and your personal math problems.
 I feel very strongly that the content is accurate and wide ranging in it's ability to help educate a student or someone who wants to sharpen their math skills.
 I do think that used appropriately the math forum page is an excellent interactive tool that will both help students and help faculty alike. One reason I feel this way is with peer review and all the resources this site brings to bare it is truly a great source of information to help students.
Ease of use, I'm not the most technical person around, but I thought it was pretty easy to manuever in and around this page to get the information you need.",4
439,"I first browsed through the site getting a understanding of the organization of the site. It has so much information but it is all easy to get to and you can even search for topics you are looking for. I than narrowed my search to educational materials. The content of this link was very interesting. They had games, audio, visuals, puzzles and more. The content was presented in a way where I could either play or I could look up serious topics through other links, but either way I was learning something. I really liked how diverse this website was, you can find so much information it applies to a vast amount of students ranging from elementary to college levels. This website was very easy to use and for first time users it will be very fun and informative.",5
439,"The Math Forum-Internet Mathematics Library is very helpful to people like me, who is not very fond of Math.It offers resources from basic Math to higher levels of Math. It has an interactive games, puzzles, and quizzes. Lots of fun. It's a good way to review Math.",4
439,"a)I probably spent almost an hour reviewing this site. It's a massive website with an overwhelming amount of links, but I mean that in a good way. I reviewed many, many topics, ranging widely across the board from our ex-President Clinton's initiatives on math education to the religious applications of math (like Islamic star patterns) to sites about very basic math. Some websites had things I could try out or follow along with and others were purely informational or maybe didn't actually concern applications of mathematics, instead being about understanding of topics surround math, like politics and educational funding.

b) This website is sort of an imitation of what MERLOT itself is, which is a collection of links that can all be used for different types of learning and teaching. As a result, though all were valuable, not all are equally great. Therefore, the educational value of the site as a whole is tremendous, however individual sites would have to be judged alone. And like anything else, some seemed to have more effort put in to them than others.

c) I think that as a teaching tool, it would be useful for Math G students especially who spend a lot of time understanding what a wide variety of topics are mathematics. The site gives a sense of having a bird's eye view of the field of mathematics, as broad and immense as it is, with all it's different topics offered and varieties of disciplines. Additionally, it's also beneficial for both students and teachers to be able to have one place where so many resources are available.

d) The very front page of the site was organized well, but not great. What does make it good though is how different search options are utilized, as things can be browsed either by topic, type of resource or level. Most websites I saw were very easy to use or follow.",4
439,"This websites title really says it all about what you will find on here. The Internet Mathematics Library is an overwhelming amount of knowledge about almost everything in math! I found good and bad things. The bad was that with every link I'd click, there would be 10 or more more options on the subject. I could see that someone might find this annoying, because they may have trouble finding their answers or also, someone could find this helpful. There is obviously a vast amount of information here. A teacher could use this site for the fantastic resources like the puzzles and games in a classroom. But also a student could independently navigate through and do research on any type of mathematical subject. The quality of what I looked at was helpful. I browsed through lessons and lecture notes and also some puzzles. The explanations of simple algebra to even statistics were clear and easy to read. This was a helpful site.Technical Remarks:Harder to navigate than usual, maybe because of the vast amount of links.",3
439,"I found this site to be very good.  I spent 30 min. reviewing the many topics and evenually found myself focusing on the Chaos, Fractals and non-linear dynamincs sections.  I liked the section on ""chaos in the classroom"" with its discussion on teaching ""the new math"" to students. I will most likely use it as a resource to write a final research paper.   However, I think this site is very comprehensive and could be used as resource for any math topic. It was easy to use, but I did find several links that were unavailable.   ",5
439,This website is so great. I must've went through almost all subjects it has. It contains all topics that I never knew could relate to Math. I had to make a speech for my Math class a couple weeks ago inregarding a topic that has to do with Math. And It would've been so easy to pick one if I knew that this website exist. The Math Forum seem to have all the materials anyone would need to relate math in everything. It explains and makes you understand the topics that you struggle to comprehend....and also provides links to other math sites which could also be very helpful. Definitely a website that is recommendable to not just anyone that loves math but also that wants to learn more.,5
439,I spent about 20 to 25 minutes browsing and using the site.  I found many different materials that would be very useful for students to use inside and outside of a classroom.  I feel that this site offers many different types of activities that students would really respond to.  There are activities that can help the students to review different topics.  There are also activities that will enable the students to extend their learning. I was impressed by all of the different activities and topics that the site covered.  I feel that there are many different uses for this site to help make the material more interesting for students.  There are also many ideas for teachers that can help them to convey different topics.  I feel that the site is very easy to use.  There are many different ways to search for material so that you are not spending alot of time weeding through information that you do not need.Technical Remarks: I found the problem of the week section to be very interesting.  I think that this is a great place for students to go to challenge themselves.  They will also be able to work with other students and contribute their thoughts.,5
439,"As soon as you go to this site you get an overwelming feeling of the possible math related problem people of all ages could need help on. I spent some time looking in various places like Geometry , Number Theory, Pre-Calculus and also I went to the Education Levels and under Elementary, since i plan to be an Elementry School teacher I thought i should look at this site. I found puzzels, quizs, history lessons and interactive games for children. and it seemed like a fun place to visit and that made a difference on whether or not if i would ever send my future students to this site. I would recomened this site to those who have problems with math and want to do better or those who enjoy math and want to spent some time exploring something they like.",5
439,"Being a person who finds math difficult,this software is exceedingly helpful. I browsed and try it in an expand of one hour. I consider all the materials given or presented in this software very effective and helpful in general. Math forum definitely could enhanced student's learning and faculty's teaching because of adequate materials in variety of math subjects. I don't see any reason why first timers would find the software perplexing. I think that this software is uncomplicated and yet so effectual. Very much recommendable.",5
439,"The Math Forum site is an extremely intuitive site for a variety of mathematical and scientific disciplines. I browsed for approximately 35 minutes, although I realized I could have spent hours upon hours observing all of the fascinating levels of information. The quality of the site was great, whether a beginning Algebra student,teacher,or a graduate student in the area of Physics, there were dependable, clean , and well-written links available to everyone. I believe it was evident in my observation of how many hours one may have to critique all disciplines effectively, that it has enormous potential to be a brilliant teaching and learning tool, especially because of the crediblity of the sources.I loved it primarily for the ease of use...even in areas of knowledge that I had never explored, the software guided me effortlessly into each new link. The only downfall would be that one could become caught up in non-relevant (to your research)topics, therefore possibly adding time to your inquiries.",5
439,"I browsed the Math Forum for an hour or so, and I found the site to be very useful. The site is basically a search engine or ""forum"" for math. It categorizes the math by skill levels from elementary to college, which is very helpful and easy to search. It then breaks down the math into sections, such as Algebra, Geometry, History of Math, etc. I will definitely use this site later in the semester for the math class that I am currently taking.Technical Remarks: My math skills are limited, so I explored the Algebra section and found it very detailed and informative. It covers the different types of Algebra such as Basic, Linear, Modern, etc. The only problem that I found, as with most search engines, is that you have to sort through some links that may not be helpful, but are related to your particular search. The good thing is that they do give you a lot to choose from. Students of all math levels will be able to benefit from this site and will have no problem utilizing the links that are provided. Teachers should strongly recommend this site to their students to help them with any math questions they may have.",4
439,"I spent about 10 minutes looking at all the resources and materials I can obtain from ""The Math Forum-Internet Mathematics Library"". If math is not your subject and you need help, this would be the place to go for basic level math to the highest math and the most complicated therories of all. Not only is Math Forum a site for resource, but it is also a place to obtain educational materials and software to benefit the mind. So long as the person the take the time to be familiarized with Math Forum, then he or she will definately be a better math student or staff.",5
440,"I have used this site for over ten years for required readings in my post-baccalaurate nutrition courses for professional and graduate students. The content is especially thorough regarding evidence-based recommendations on dietary macronutrients (carbs, protein, fats) as part of a healthy diet. Also strong are sections on body weight, salt, and beverages. Vitamins and minerals are less thoroughly covered (for those I use the Linus Pauling Micronutrient Information center at http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/).The database is regularly updated and expanded, most recently a separate linked site on obesity prevention has been developed at http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/This resource should be categorized under Health Sciences Preventive Medicine and Nutrition as well.Technical Remarks:The database is regularly updated and expanded. For that reason, any learning activities or exam questions based on the content may need to be revised if the content changes.",5
440,"This site has a wealth of nutritional information, conveniently arranged and seemingly very thorough. Although it seems to be consumer-oriented at first glance, one can go much deeper on each topic by choosing to read the full articles, all of which are fully referenced. Instead of just giving the latest advice on nutritional issues, the epidemiology of nutritional science is stressed so that the uncertainties are not glossed over. 

The site is entirely text-based, though with attrative illustrations, so that each part loads rapidly without any delays.",4

It took me a while to look through just their long list of known primes. This site has handy tips for how to calculate primes, both big and small, and is recently updated. The formatting is heavily text oriented, but the content is easily read.",4
443,"Warning: this is kind of addictive... it's a game, after all. It's helpful that there is also text around it to give theoretical perspective on the philosophical problem. Can it also be used in teaching probability? Can the game be enahnced by adding a score for ""correctly guessing"" your opponent's strategy (if random is chosen)? Can it be done as a 2-player game (obviously this can be done face to face, too!)Technical Remarks:Requires Shockwave",4
443,As fine a presentation of The Prisoner's Dilemma as you are likely to find in a two dimensional format.  The key here is to get students to read the text that accompanies the simulation.  The text is a first rate presentation as well.,4
443,I really enjoyed using this website.  I spent about half an hour on the site playing with the interactive game as well as reading some of the text explaining the whole concept of the Prisoner's Dilema.  This website introduced me to a concept in Philosophy that I had not been exposed to yet-- Game Theory.  I found the concept fascinating and it would have been extremely difficult to understand without the aid of the interactive game or the easy-to-read explaination.  I would almost certainly use this in the classroom in a course which covered this material.  The website as a whole is very user-friendly. The page is well laid out and pertinent to the field.,5
444,"I wish I had found this website two semesters ago when I almost did not make it through my graduate Phonetics course!  This sight is a really great resource to have at home, especially for students who are visual learners like myself.  The website provides descriptions and visuals of all of the important aspects of phonology (manner, place, voice) for consonants and vowels in American English, Spanish and German.Technical Remarks:I am working for an iMac and did not have any trouble accessing this website or its videos.

Very nice set up!",5
444,"This site is ideal for the student that is having trouble making the connection between phonology and pronunciation. It offers very useful animated libraries of sounds in both the English and Spanish Language. As a speaker of both Spanish and English, the site is very accurate, and has led me to better understand phonetics in both languagesTechnical Remarks: One drawback to site is that it takes very updated software to run. I have tried to run the English sounds on a few computers around my University, and the system was not able to handle the English Sounds library",5
445,This is a great source for teaching videos and lesson ideas. It also offers blogs and newsletters. The website is easy to maneuver. ,4
445,"I believe this will be a great tool for staff development, and training. The site is easy to navigate, and well organized. The content is relative and applicable for every stage in education.",4
447,I found this to be a really useful site because it gives many different examples (both text and video) that explain how to solve problems on a TI-83 calculator. I think it can be a very useful tool as those calculators can help students solve difficult problems in math classes.,4
447,"In the past few years, I have purchased several calculators. However, I do not like reading manuals, so I have never learned how to use them effectively. I was thrilled to find this informative site that provides clear and concise demonstrations of the various functions of the TI-83+ calculator. The audio and video qualities are excellent. The pace of the animations makes them easy to follow. The narration tells you exactly what to do. I was flabbergasted to find out that I had all this calculating power right under my fingertips. I think that every math teacher should make this site known to their students and require them to practice using the functions their calculators provide.",5
447,"This is a great resource to all members of the mathematics and science world. In a day and age that is focused and reliant upon technology, the use of calculators in the classroom and in the workforce is greater then ever. I think that the instruction on how to properly operate the standard of calculators, the TI-83+, helps those who need to use them and even those who are supposed to teach others how to use them. The videos that are linked on this page are very effective and well done, with clear and concise instructions that I could not help but join in with on my own TI-83+ that I have no more then 6 inches from my keyboard. Bravo to the person who felt it necessary to teach us how to use the tools of the trade, it was greatly appreciated and needed!",4
447,"In high school and college, I was told to get a graphing calculator. We would be expected to use the calculators during certain times. I could never figure out how to use the thing! This website shows you exactly how to understand and use a TI-83+ calculator. Because I found this page exciting, I spent a long time looking at it. I found the videos to me the most helpful. I could read the text version, to understand what I needed to do in order to make my calculator function properly, and view the video to see what buttons to press. The quality of this page is great. It's to the point, and shows me how to correctly use the TI-83+. If I would have known this site existed before, I probably would have used my calculator. Instead, I bought a cheaper, more simple one. This recommend this website to any teacher or student who needs to learn how to use their calculator. This site provides many examples, text to read, and videos to show you what to do. It made it simple, interesting, and fun! The site is very easy to locate, and use. Clicking the links either sends you to a video example or text on instructions. I guess what I'm getting at is.. THIS WAS A VERY HELPFUL SITE!",4

There is an abundance of images and masterpieces for one to behold.  The site is easily navigated, however they are still frames so it is a bit slow, but the pixel quality is wonderful!  I truly enjoyed listening to the hopes and dreams of an artist that will live in infamy, but at the time was as unsure of his abilities and worried that the true understanding/meaning of his work would be neglected, it was as if it were you or I holding the brush! I truly enjoyed all avenues of exploration in regard to this site, and hope you will also!Technical Remarks: A bit slow, and audio broken up a bit, otherwise wonderful!",4
453,"This is a very thorough resource for many statistical and probability concepts.  I liked the probability calculations especially for beginning statistics/probability students.  The hypothesis tests seemed a little complicated for beginning statistics students.  I probably would not use this in my classroom, but I might point out this resource to my students in my probability class for homework help.Technical Remarks:Some of the instructions were a little hard to follow (like on the conditional probability section).

464,"While I found the readings on this site to likely be engaging and possibly challenging for grade 4-12 learners (as noted in the Teacher's Guide, or grade 6-12 learners as noted in the About section), several aspects of the layout and, more notably, what seem to be problems with updates to the site would keep me for using it.

As of the writing of this comment, the Quizzes, Notes and Proof for each reading seem to be no longer accessible (users ""not authorized to use this page""). The Speak Out chat section from the home page is also non-functional (""page cannot be found""). While the Tips-o-Matic option still leads to useful information on sentence to essay level grammar, it apparently was at one time meant to be able to be ""turned on"" for interactive assistance with readings offered on the site--this is no longer the case. Finally, while the Teacher's Guide offers sound suggestions for use in the classroom, it obviously has not been updated for some time, as it continues to list RealAudio as a ""new type of computer software."" Some continuing maintenance (e.g. the ongoing addition of new suggestions for classroom or student autonomous use) would be helpful here.",2
464,"I viewed this material for about 1 hour for a class assignment.  I felt that this site covered all the bases of writing very well, starting with the basics of vocabulary and building up to a full length essay.  With each new concept, there were helpful tips for the student which gave a deeper look at each step of the writing process.  The material was augmented with teacher suggestions for outside activities which, if used together, can give students a rich lesson in essay writing.  The general essay skills taught by this site will be useful for students (4-12 grade levels) throughout their scholastic career.  I felt that this site was attractively put together with a very clear and straight forward format.Technical Remarks: This site requires Real Audio (free listening software).

The resources provide by this site are rich in images, maps, and painting to raise cultural awareness.Technical Remarks:Flash Player and Quick Time",5
467,"I spent several hours exploring the site and intend to use it this semester because it fully develops the process of developing literacy skills as opposed to just giving the student a selection from a short story with no background or follow-up activities.Modulos culturales is an extremely well designed multimedia literacy project created for first-year Spanish language students at Dartmouth College. There are four units that introduce students to works of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, Mexican author Francisco Jimenez, Spanish poet Juan Ramon Jimenez, and Spanish Gustavo Adolfo Bequer. All are accompanied by a very nice variety of activities that include art, literature, and film to inspire creative writing and discussion. The goal of the site is to encourage and support students as they systematically develop literacy skills and cultural awareness at this level. Each Modulo cultural includes background information, pre-reading activities, the text itself, and a follow-up personal analysis or related writing assignment. In addition to the Modulos culturales, there is a wonderful page dedicated to a mural of Mexican artist Jose Clemente Orozo. The author of Modulos culturales includes an extensive number of refreshing activities for different learning styles. Part of each Modulo includes a  ""How to"" page with dozens of suggestions for how to effectively incorporate the activities as homework, class work, or as group activities.  Each of the Modulus could easily be incorporated into an existing syllabus at the intermediate to advanced level. The process of acquiring literary skills is very effectively intertwined with the exploration of cultural issues and grammar.Technical Remarks: The current versions of Flash Player and QuickTime are required. Download links are provided. Site navigation is excellent.",5
468,"I was exposed to this resource as a student, in the class where WebQuests are taught.Since, then I've pointed faculty and students to it because I notice most conduct searches inefficiently. Even pointing out the advantages of using Google advanced search, which I always now use, usually results in smiling faces.This tutorial is valuable to any situation that asks learners to search the Net. Learners who've mastered what has become a basic ICT skill, have more time and cognitive resources to attend to the  task as hand.    ",5

470,"For my second objective I chose ""East Asia in WorldHistory"" by the East Asia Institute Columbia University.The site is made to help teachers with the burden ofcreating a lesson plan and activities for the student. The website goes incredibly in depth into the history ofChina.  It has hundreds of links for you to always beable to go somewhere else.  The site has differentassignments for students it even has some filmassignments.  But this site doesn't just have the workyou need to do.  If you follow the links you will go into the curriculum materials to another page of links.These links include all of the class readings, maps andseveral more. I must say that the page is a very niceand neat one and I think it is an easy website to followand learn from.Technical Remarks: The website has easy to follow links.  And a nice web layout.",3
471,This site has a great deal of content from Assessments to Technology Integration. I liked the way the videos were presented. Also I thought that the instructional modules were a good idea. The website was easy to access and I was able to navigate it with speed to find what I wanted.  I believe that this site will be a useful resource to me in the future.,5
472,"This site is clear and elaborate and the pictures are so abundant. It attracts me a lot. I spent a lot of time to review this Website and I can obtain a lot from it. Every section is so detailed. In this material, each topic section is organized so well that I can find the information quickly and easily. I can get a lot of information about every aspect of ocean in this material. In conclusion, it is the excellent material, and very comprehensive and useful. Technical Remarks: It is a good program for me to use. In this site, every section contains quick links to various points in the topic's pages. It is so convenient for me to browse other information about ocean. In addition, it provides many resources (ocean-related references) for me to understand more about the ocean world. ",4
473,"I spent about 30 minutes to an hour going through the site and creating a complementary assignment.     The site is well-organized and it is easy to find specific information.  However, there are a few links that do not work.       This could enhance learning due to the good information and the good pictures.  Especially as 1980 is not too long ago, and the volcano may erupt again, this will keep students' interest.  It could have a numer of uses in the classroom.",4
474,"This site is very strong, but for community college freshmen I worry that the amount of writing on each page would be a deterrent to really digging into the material. They are generally averse to reading so when a page visually appears to be full of text they may move on or shut down. There was a video within The Writing Process tab with good information, but the voice sounded almost bored with itself which kept the material from becoming enticing.",4
474,"This is the best interactive English resource that I have found; it appeals to different learning modalities, especially 21st century learners who expect technological learning activities.

Excelsior's OWL is being integrated into curriculum at colleges around the country including Valencia College in Orlando Florida and Sand Diego Mesa College in California.  At Excelsior, it is being used instead of a book in a lower-level English course, saving students money.",5
475,"This learning object could be better understood as a collection.  For each of 12 topics (touch, hearing, balance, etc.) the author provides an animated Flash presentation, a pdf. version for those who may not have flash, practice problems, and links to more information.  The flash presentations themselves contain several subtopics.  For example, ""the eye"" has subtopics of lens, retina, fovea, etc.  

For best use, I would recommend the user pinpointing the exact location of the specific materials they wish their students to review, otherwise, the shear volume of material may seem intimidating.Technical Remarks:My only critique is that the home website is a bit difficult to understand at first.  It takes the user a few minutes to understand how the site is organized, and what use they could make of it.  Also, there is no button to return to the homepage, once one is within a flash presentation for a specific topic.",5

478,"Subject Review #2 Christy Wilcox  Review of Module ""Tutankhamun"" Submittedby: Carol Schneebeck Reviewed by: Christy Wilcoxhttp://www.civilisations.ca/civil/egypt/egtut01e.html     I reviewed the module ""Tutankhamun.""  The module wassubmitted by Carol Schneebeck from Sonoma StateUniversity in California.  This module has informationon King Tutankhamun.  The information covers his death,his life and times, the curse of his mummy, the funeral,it has a tour of his tomb and treasures.  Each subtitleon the homepage will go to the information when clickedon.  Each one has the information that will be needed tounderstand more clearly.  There are words that arehighlighted and if you click on it it will give you adefinition and maybe a picture to exlain.  This moduleis helpful and full of information, but this informationcan be found in the other sites as well.  Probably thesame information that is in this one, but this is a goodsite to read and it is hard to be confused.  Because thedefinitions are highlighted and the information isbroken down into subtitles and the text is easy toread. ",3
478,"The site gives information surrounding the life of Tutankhamun.  The main page is a very brief story of how his tomb was discovered.  Also, there are links to other pages titled ""Life and Times"", ""The Cause of His Death"", ""Tutankhamun's Funeral"", ""Tutankhamun's Tomb"", ""Tutankhamun's Treasures"", and finally ""The Mummy's Curse.""	The ""Life and Times"" page gives a small amount of information about when he was born, who a few of his relatives were, and the fact that his death is still a mystery.  It does not really go into detail about his life or into the theories of how he died.  It does, however, give links to other sites containing information about a few of the relatives, the meaning and more information about this name, along with theories of his death.  One link on the page, http://www.scs.wsu.edu/~mrobin/pharaoh_death.html, leads to a very interesting site telling of Tut's predecessor and a theory of why he died.	The next part of the site is titled ""The Cause of His Death."" It gives a bit of information about Tut's death and about deaths of others such as a possible successor to Tut and the death of Tut's wife.  Not much else is discussed here.	The next section is ""Tutankhamun's Funeral."" It gives details about Tut's coffin and the tomb.  This page just gives the reader a brief description allowing for a partial idea of how Tut was prepared and how the tomb appeared.  The following section is ""Tutankhamun's Tomb."" This section gives a description of the inside of the tomb.  It has several pictures and even a virtual tour of the tomb.  A passage from Howard Carter tells of the inside of the tomb as it was first viewed.  This page doesn't contain much information as well,
 but it does have many links to other pages which further explain particular terms.	""Tutankhamun's Treasures"" gives a very light description of what was found in the tomb.  It has several pictures, though, and links to galleries of pictures.  The final section, ""TheMummy's Curse,"" of course tells about the rumored Mummy's Curse.  It just gives a few incidents of deaths near the time the tomb was opened.	The site gave a small amount of information about King Tutankhamun, nothing in great detail.  It did, however, give a lot of links to other resources of information about King Tut.  It was just a broad report that one could read to become somewhat familiar with who Tut was.",4
478,"I found this site about Tutankhamun and his tomb. This site tells a good bit of information about his life, causes of his death, what his tomb looked like, and it even tells about the famous curse of the mummy. I found this site very helpful and interesting. There is alot of helpful and useful info on this site.",4
479,"This site (developed by Scientific Learning Corporation), provides a number of simple tutorial modules on topics related to brains, minds and learning. These modules are simple by design, being aimed at the public in general and the teachers and parents of children with specific difficulties in language and reading in particular. What concerns me most about this site is that it is primarily a promotional medium for a specific and controversial computer-based intervention program, Fast ForWord.  It is, in my opinion, a subtly produced Infomercial. I'd have serious reservations about using it in teaching unless students are sophisticated enough to separate the science from the sales pitch.[NOTE: Time spent examining the site: 2 hrs].Technical Remarks: For a fairly thorough and even-handed review of the Fast ForWord Language intervention program, check out the report provided by the Florida Center for Reading Research. It's available at: http://www.fcrr.org/FCRRReports/PDF/Fast_ForWord_Language_Report.pdf] There is an extensive and growing literature on the issues and controversies surrounding the theoretical and clinical basis of Fast ForWord.

479,I went through the site to see what the different links held.  While I would not use this site within a specific lesson.  It could be a good source for students trying to decide what kind of research paper or oral report to give in an undergraduate Educational Psychology course.Technical Remarks: The links worked and there seemed to be no problems accessing the different areas.,3
480,"I have used an activity similar to this in my Practical Accounting classes. I will try to schedule one class period for the activity (a class lasts 80 minutes) and try to set up the boards before students come to class. This allows for the maximum time possible for playing the game. I will also slip in a Monopoly day if we get through a chapter in fewer days than scheduled. Once students have played the game once, they will often ask when another opportunity to play can be arranged.This activity gives each student a chance to analyze a unique set of transactions. I also encourage the students to help each other work through the tougher transactions (paying someone for a vote or winning a beauty pagent). In class, students are only required to journalize the transactions that affect them as the game is played. Outside of class, they post the transactions to the ledger and prepare an income statement, statement of owner's equity, and a balance sheet. I use instructions that are similar to those provided with this material.",4

483,"            This application is an awesome tool that allows students to take the practice of exponent rules into their own hands. Thanks to the different categories, students and teachers are able to complete examples that are most appropriate to their current understanding of exponent rules. Along these lines, the “hint” feature not only gives students short statements of help, but also gives students a warning that they may be working on questions that are above their current level of understanding. The questions are written clearly, and the input box is easy to locate and use. The application allows multiple attempts so that students cannot simply give up and move to another problem before first figuring out their mistakes. Overall, this is a great tool that students can benefit from both in and out of the classroom!            While using this program, students are not able to fully simplify problems as it does not allow for the input of fractions as final answers (we spend a lot of time working with students on not writing their answers with negative exponents). This allows for a discussion in class regarding how students could fully simplify the problem, and also allows for students to work with negative exponents and think about what they mean. Again, overall, this applet is a great addition to any exponent unit! Thank you for sharing it! ",4

The quality of the materials presented on this site was outstanding and I found it to be clear, well written and very helpful.  I think that this would be a very effective teaching tool as well an important resource for parents.   Technical Remarks: The site was very well laid out.  The combination of side bars and navigation buttons at the top made it easy to reach all areas within the site.",5
485,"1. I spent a while browsing through the materials this site provided. I read through the first few pages of the first lesson and then browsed through the lessons that followed. This site also provided assignments and quizes that I looked over.2. As far as I know the sites seems to have very accurate information and provides much knowledge of childhood trauma- what it is, how it affects children, and how to cope with it.3. I feel that the information provided on this site would definetly enhance students as well as teachers knowledge in this area. In fact this information is designed for course use. The information provided allows students to learn and explore information in this field, and feedback from the students will help provide individual thoughts and experiences to the teacher.Technical Remarks: 4. I found that accessing this information would be very easy and beneficial to first time users.",4

Information was easy to find, enrolling in classes was self-explanatory.",4
485,Ispent about 45minutes in this site.  Going over the general details of what to expect in the happenings of the world today.  I understand more now then I did before.  I'm going to copy this and take it to our school and hopes that the teachers can use this to help with the students who are having problems understanding what is happening in our society today.  I hope that at least this artical can help one child to understand and not hate anyone who is differentTechnical Remarks: First time users will beable to understand this artical very well and its very well organized.,5
485,I spent 21/2 hours on this site. I became a member and looked at all the courses being offered. They are all proffesionallly done and offer much information. I especially liked the article on The  Neurodevelopmental Costs of Adverse Childhood Events.Technical Remarks: I had no problems with the site and I feel first time users will have no problems navigating it.,5

488,"This free online handbook is a useful reference source for students who are studying style as it relates to speaking or writing. The information about rhetorical devices is as good as can be found in any reference guide covering the subject. Entries for specific terms could perhaps be improved with pronunciation tips because many students struggle with Greek. Richard Harris, the author, has also written _Writing with Clarity and Style: A Guide to Rhetorical Devices for Contemporary Writers_. The book provides more examples and includes exercises that may be used in the classroom.Technical Remarks:The site is loaded with advertisements and is not designed for easy browsing or searching.

490,"Thank you for your hard work and dedication. It is a daunting task to compile all this data. The information is valuable, but I think there are ways to improve the user experience.The introduction page should specify the time period that is the focus for this study. The terms ""post-emancipation"" and ""post-slavery"" are vague; based on the material I browsed, the relevant dates overlap with the Reconstruction Era. However, there are those last few remaining years of the 1890s that need attention, as well. The map data is very useful, but the map also needs some data clarification (date, source, etc.) to make it more effective.  Also, some of the recent information is old.The online classroom is OK, but it needs to be more engaging - using hypertext, video, photos and audio will be extremely helpful when contextualizing this aspect of history. We take for granted that people know the context of 19th century American ideologies and attitudes, but many, many people make incorrect assumptions, based on their limited knowledge, and the pervasive myths of Antebellum America (like Gone with The Wind). It is absolutely essential that a substantial context is provided, so people can gain a better understanding of the significant obstacles African Americans faced during the later 19th century. For example, just because a white person, Southerner or not, was against slavery, did not automatically mean the person did not have racial biases. Perhaps newspaper articles, speech debate flyers, ads and cartoons will help provide that context. Even among people perceived as their allies, African Americans had to struggle against systematic and institutional racial bias and discrimination.Also, I did not see much census and Freedmen registry data information. Perhaps I missed it? What about the Gullah population of Georgetown, Pawley's Island and the coast? How do they figure into this historical narrative? What relationships did they have with freed slaves? The intra-racial or intra-ethnic aspects of slave status, color and class are also important to examine, especially in regard to the post-emancipation era.Technical Remarks:The site is very easy to use, but the page design, as it is, is very busy and cluttered. The beta website is more streamlined, which is less-distracting. The sizes of the text and the map should be larger. Also, for ease of access, there should be a text to speech option to provide audio for the visually imparied.",3
491,This site contains many ideas for teachers to teach astronomy in the classroom.,5
492,"A very easy to use and attractive site. The use of the tabs to navigate the various sections of the orchestras worked well.

493,"This material presents solid interactive tutorials, animations, video clips, and presentations about the human mind and body.  Areas of focus include senses, organs, skeletal system, muscular systems, nervous system, and puberty in the brain section.  The mind section contains information on emotions, intelligence, mental disorders, and a brain map.  Overall this site provides a wealth of information related to many aspects of psychology that are worth reviewing.  Specifically I thought the puberty interactive demo was a great piece of learning material that could be used with a homework assignment outside of class.Technical Remarks:Almost all of the links are fully operations and the quality of the links is very high.  This is just a small subset of the BBC Science & Nature website.",4
494,"Very easy to use, fun. Nevertheless, it has some mistakes that may confuse the students (AUTIN FLINT instead of Austin Flint) and some of the explanations are not very clear (""1st part of murmur is caused by vent. syst. the 2nd by vent. diast., and the 3rd by atrial syst.).Technical Remarks:Friendly to use.",4
495,This is an excellent resource! it is well-structured and there is much to learn from the components of this moving and realistic case study.In an ideal world I'd have liked some interpretation and references to enhance the learning. Technical Remarks:Requires Flash.

495,"A great case study for the field of social science and more specifically clinical work.  I have referred this case study to students after hearing that they will be involved with protective services in dealing with their patients.  They have found it helpful.

496,"This would certainly be useful, but woul dneed to be adjusted for your specific location. It gives the students the necessary steps in finding compnay information. In the past, I have assumed they could find company financial information, only to find I was incorrect. This is a good guide.",4
497,"I really like these cartoons as a different way to assess my students on what they have learned so far about evolution.  It could be a good formative assessment for high school students.  I do not believe my middle school students know enough about evolution to be able to make even an educated guess.  However, I am planning on using them throughout the unit in order to assess my students' learning.  I think using the cartoons as an assessment will engage the students.",4

502,"I show the New Asylums’ in my introduction to psychology class currently. This follow up is excellent.  Students recognize the challenges and burden on the system of incarcerating the mentally ill upon watching The New Asylums. For some, the answer to this problem is to release the incarcerated mentally ill and give support in the community, but, as freshman and sophomores, they do not understand what that looks like and the challenges that are faced which lead to individuals being incarcerated again.   This next installment follow release of those incarcerated and shows clearly that there are no easy answers. It calls for solutions and consideration of a population oft overlooked and can challenge students to think and act in response to the rights and needs of the mentally ill in their communities.Technical Remarks:I am only able to get the new asylums through a subscription service. Will this be the same?",5

516,"1. I spent about a half hour reviewing the material by trying the exercises and going through the tutorial. 

2. I found the quality of content to be very good. The site is called visual fractions and I was drawn to it by the name because I am a visual learner. According to the tutorial you choose, you can add, subtract, multiply or divide fractions visually with circles or lines. If you get stuck you can click “explain” and it will provide the answer for you with an explanation. I found the visual aspect of it to be helpful rather than just looking at numbers. So for someone who is new to fractions and is a visual learner, this site would be great. 
 
3. This would be a great resource for teachers and students learning to be enhanced. Students can benefit from the visual presentations if they are having trouble with conventional ways of learning fractions and teachers benefit by being able to present the math a different way to allow the student to understand.

4. This site is very easy to use. It has an intuitive navigation bar on the left which lets you know all of the learning categories the site has to offer. All you have to do is click one of them and it takes you right to the tutorial and you can jump right in. In my opinion first time users will have no problems.",4
516,"Fabulous, meticulous interactive  for visual presentation.  Detailed explanation included below the interactive part of page.",5
517,"Generally, I like the UNC Writing Center's handouts and have used them previously. My concerns are that the description implies this is about sociology, but in fact it is about writing in sociology. The description needs updated. Also, there are books about writing in sociology and sociology has its own styleguide. These should be listed as resources and to some extent, should be incorporated into the handout. ",3
517,"I have not used this yet with students, but I will be doing so as it offers useful resources for thinking about and writing expository papers for sociology.Technical Remarks:This resource is clearly written, with good examples of the various ideas presented.  While it does not presume prior sociological knowledge, it will be of most use to students with some background in sociology who may be familiar with the ideas (e.g. ""unit of analysis"", quantitative/qualitative research, ""ecological fallacy"") but need reminders of fundamental points to consider and pitfalls to avoid in producing a piece of sociological writing.  An instructor could use this resource with introductory students by revising it to focus on fewer issues or walking through it with them  with reference to a specific assignment (and providing more specific examples with opportunities to practice).  Since there is so much text (and thus may be difficult to hold attention, especially for a student anxious about how to tackle a research assignment),  an alternative to the pdf might be to provide the on-line source using a more outlined approach to the various sections with links to specifics and additional exaamples.  ",4
517,This site provides some good advice on writing sociological papers for students.  I think this site provides good advice for students above the mechanics of writing sociological papers.  This would be a good additional resource for students trying to write sociologically.  I think this would be good for students at all levels.,4
518,"Cleanly designed with appropriate visuals that exemplify the points being made by the narrator.  Content focuses on basic information about what Wikipedia is, it's role in providing information, and basic technical aspects.  It will be an excellent resource for not only library websites but also to be included in courses that require research components as part of the overall grade. Because the focus is general in nature it is not outdated.Technical Remarks:The video is embedded in the source instituion's webpage.  Accessed using Firefox 15.0.1 on a Mac running OS 10.8.2 I had no problem streaming the material.  It did not require buffering (I'm on a high speed internet connection) nor did it stall out at any point.",5

Was one of the first few links off of a google search.Excellent article on how the importance of ""Strategic Human Resource Management"" in a global business environment. Focus is primarily on effectively managing people in multi-national and transnational firms. Very easy read.",4
520,"This is an excellent museum-based website readily usable in art or humanities courses where the teacher has internet access.  I was very impressed with the current exhibitions area call ""In Focus: Still Life"" at http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/focus_still_life/  The information was both conceptual and historical.  The photos of the artwork are well done, and there are even various audio clips.  Very nice.  I hope that they keep these topical internet collections available after the exhibit ends.Technical Remarks:I use such sites in college humanities courses where I have internet access on a computer connected to an overhead projector.",5
520,"Review of materials: I spent an hour searching for things the first day I discovered this sight. It has a lot of information for a teacher, especially one that teaches in an art magnet school. I like that I can search for lessons and they are already planned out. The lessons provided were easy to follow and complete. They even provide artwork to go along with the lesson.Quality of content: The content is wonderful. The concepts are easy for my 4th grade students to grasp. I will be using this site as a reference in my classroom.Potential Effectiveness: This site could add to my students understanding of the arts. Specifically the Visual Arts, this is the area I concentrated my search on.Ease of using materials: Very easy to use and find information. Technical Remarks: In the 4 times I have been in this site I have found no problems.",5
520,"Quality of Content--The rich information and material relevant to artwork which is a very useful teaching materials for teachers. The topic of each lesson can be a stimulus and also help students develope the knowledge of the culture and society.Lesson plan--Teaching Landmarks, grade level 4-12is quite interesting to students. In this activity, studetns can think of their own landmarks or the landmarks are special to them.Students can use their imagination-- the part that appeals me to apply the topic.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching--Yes, I think it can effectively be a teaching tool in class because of its various artworks and image,which usually students would pay more attention on it. Both the teacher and the students can havea wonderful trip of artworks.",5
521,"This is a great range of topics, but many of the resources have become dated or are unavailable through broken links. With an update, this could become a valuable resource again.",2
521,"It has some great ideas.  I was looking specifically for an exercise for product lifecycle.  The assignment was good, but only 2 of the links were operational.  I was able to adapt without th elinks, but I would have been happier if they had all been active.",3
521,"The publisher also provides these bound as softcover books to instructors who adopt their Marketing textbooks.  I have used several editions to develop major projects and useful class exercises for my Principles of Marketing class.These are very helpful because they are proven methods for teaching different aspects of Marketing.  So if you cannot think of a way to explain brand equity, for instance, you can look up how someone else does it successfully.This is a very valuable resource to brighten up any Marketing course--whether lecture or online.Technical Remarks:Very easy to use.",5
522,"I really like how this exercise is designed.  Students can practice, and at each step they are provided with really good feedback concerning their choice.Technical Remarks:This presentation has great information, but is lacking in visual appeal.",4
522,"Nice job of explaining the logical steps and thought processes needed to perform a Z hypothesis test for the population mean.  U could see using this activity in a computer lab for a week/chapter when there really isn't any SPSS work.  You could also make a homework assignment out of the printable handouts that are provided.

I think this could be a much more effective teaching tool if more graphics were used (shading of Normal curve when explaining P-values and conclusions, possibly some pictures to go with the story). Even more spaces between sentences in the explanations would make it easier for the students to read the important material.  The author does emphasize the difference between sample and population means, which is important. The null hypothesis question after the applet is very basic.  It would have been good to through some inequalities in there to make sure the student knew that the null hypothesis always gets the equal sign.Technical Remarks:When I clicked on the link to the applet in Firefox, I was sent to a search page, not to the applet.  The applet was the first link listed on the search page.  For the second example, the applet link came right up.",4
523,Assistive technology use is critical in the special education classroom. This resource link is very useful in that it defines as well as provide adequate guide for the use of various assistive technologies in the inclusive education classrooms.This link can best be described a onestop shop for assistive technology selection that will address all the accommodations necessary for inclusive education classrooms.,5
524,An excellent resource.  I have used these pages in several undergad and postgrad courses,5
525,Site is updated! Now links to the Smithsonian Jazz site of the American History Museum.  The Education section gives lesson plans designed for middle and high school students. The collections and archives sections gives links to special library collections. Overall a valuable site for educators introducing secondary school age students to jazz history.,5
525,"Great collection of some representative information. This site functions more like a teaser than a full-blown learning object. The sound-bites are very few and short, and there are very few links to free online research resources.Technical Remarks:Some links (e.g. Link to NPR jazz programs, under ""Audio"") are broken. 
I like the simple and consistent design throughout the site.",3
526,"This site contains an array of information for classroom use. The basic information about color and color uses is good for beginning art students, as well as, art teachers. The site is easy to follow and it does not have an over-abundance of information to confuse students. This was a good site for introducing middle-age students to color and value. The pre-made power-point presentation is a time-saving valuable tool for educators. The site featured a section on artroom activites that was used by an eighth grade art class. The thirty-five students that visited the site were asked to go into the color theory vocab site and find answers that pertained to color. As far as using the site, the students answers ranged from really easy to difficult. I received a variety of responses to the questions I asked of the students. I was surprised to learn that quite a few students prefer to learn about certain aspects of art from the website.There were some students that would prefer to learn from an instructor.  Once the students finished looking at the site they were given directions that pertained to what they learned about color and color mixing. The color theory site gave a variety of examples of student work that is always refreshing to see. I will be using this site again when I have a new classroom full of students. I do believe the visuals really help.Technical Remarks:Most of the site was easy to use. I found that when using the drawing program that a popup would continue to show up.",4
527,"This open source is useful.
The Content is well organized according to levels which makes it easy to access.",4
528,"Current assessment philosophy suggests that variety yields greater and more useful evidence of student accomplishments.  This resource makes a variety of assessment techniques available to instructors.  While the resource is designed by and for college faculty, it would be useful to instructors at all levels.Technical Remarks: A resource is available to create your own Student Assessment of Learning Gains web-based instrument:http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/salgains/instructor/",5
529,"The exercises are straightforward, but useful.  I especially like that there are some that can be reviewed by instructor, while others are self-check.Technical Remarks:A little hard to navigate",4
529,"Though not as robust as other grammar sites, these exercises, intended for beginning students, can be submitted to an instructor, similar to current publishers' sites. These exercises are usable immediately.Technical Remarks: I did not experience any problems. Exercises need to be completely filled out in order for the exercises to be sent.",4
530,This website is quite helpful to those who want to learn or observe more about stress.  It was interesting how the website explains the steps of stress.  ,4
531,Really nice interaction and a good demonstration of this basic experiment. Great for an online interaction in a class that might not meet face-to-face.,4
531,"The interactive nature of the material is really great. Students can perform the Stroop task themselves and get a summary of their reaction time data, which makes this concept very concrete. The Stroop task reaction times are also compared to the ""reverse"" Stroop reaction times, demonstrating that the font color of the word interferes much less (if at all) with reading the word. 

For the college psychology student, I think it would have been helpful if this example used terminology common in classes and textbooks - describing the stimuli as incongruent and neutral, instead of ""interference"" and ""normal"" (congruent stimuli were not described). This could be something an instructor could talk about before students go through the simulation. 

Also, while the simulation does a good job of demonstrating the Stroop effect, the wrap up and explanation are a bit lacking for a college level course. After students complete everything, the instructor may want to explain why the reverse Stroop effect is so small (reading is a much more practiced skill than color naming, automatic and hard to inhibit), why the task might be easier when the response buttons are color patches instead of words (visual pattern matching, don't need to represent responses at a deeper, semantic level), or talk about how this task demonstrates selective attention.",4
531,Looking over the Stroop Test was interesting.  I spent about an hour going over it and taking the tests.  It stimulated my mind and was exciting to try to do.  It stirred something up.  I would be interested in learning more about the Stroop Effect and what it is all about.  My curisoty is peeked.  Students will learn how much they rely on their reading skills.  They will also realize how hard it is to change what is thought to be a simple project into a challenge.Technical Remarks:the test was easy to use.  The directions were simple to follow.  The difficulty came when the test was saying do this and your mind wanted to do something else.My perception and thinking were challenged.,5
532,This item has been triaged and is under peer review by the Teacher Education Editorial Board.,5
532,"I've used the learning gains survey during the Spring 2001 semester in two different environments:  one is in a graduate education course and the second is in a 10-week intensive faculty development event.  Customizing the survey to my specific needs took about 1 1/2 hours initially, and then after editing and revising I spent another hour refining the tool and learning how to make it available to students.Given that the current focus in assessment is on learning outcomes, the survey provides a good example of how one would go about assessing for learning gains.  Participants in the faculty development event who were exposed to this tool indicated a high level of interest, and a majority of the participants plan to incorporate the tool into their current courses.The tool generated a great deal of qualitative data from faculty about their learning gains during the faculty development event.  This data was generated in the text boxes after each section of the survey, where individuals are asked to explain the ratings they gave in the prior section.First time users may have to spend a bit of time figuring out how to customize the tool.  The instructions are heavy on the text, and are not designed graphically to direct the eye.Technical Remarks: The tool is somewhat clunky and does not rate well when compared to ease of use of tools such as Zaplet or Zoomerang.",3
533,great site to show parts of DNA structure. I spend 30 minutes on the site and plan to use it during my biology lectures,4
533,"This is a good website for the teacher to show the students that the 3D structure of DNA. I spent about 20 minutes reviewing this site. I could use this to teach the topic of DNA structure in a Living Environment class. The students can be benefit from the model by fully understanding the structure of DNA. nitrogen bases pairing, double helix, etc.",4
534,"This site is an excellent source of photographs, illustrations and videos related to public health. It has a large number of available pictures which are easily searchable using keywords. 

For example, using the keyword immunization there are a total of 309 images, of which 261 are public domain photos. The keyword vaccination yielded 572 images, of which 501 are public domain photos and five are public domain videos. Here are a few other examples: AIDS  227 images; influenza  133 images; salmonella  49 images; nutrition  124 images; blood pressure  24 images; mosquito  617 images.

There are many ways to search the database, other than simple keywords. These ways include within date ranges, by type of image, by phrases, and searches with searches to narrow the scope of a search. One may also narrow a search by sorting within Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) from the National Library of Medicine.

As the web site states, the images are:  Available free of charge; Print quality; Accessible through the Internet to both Macintosh and PC users; Copyright cleared (with few exceptions) All give the source information, and in some cases extensive descriptions.

Its hard to imagine a more useful source of images and related teaching materials.Technical Remarks:The pictures can be saved easily by right-clicking on the picture and choosing either copy or save picture as Many of the photos are high resolution pictures suitable for any sort of teaching medium so you also have the option of downloading the high resolution version.",5
535,A great tool for e-learning educators.  I will bookmark this for future use.,5
536,"Part two of three parts to an outstanding interactive exercise for students learn about population dynamics. Well written and requires students to figure out the answers. If incorrect answer, takes them back to the basic material. Very well done.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash Player",5
537,"This would certainly be usable resource to incorporate into Critical Thinking workshops. They provide a free 30 day trial download access to test-dive! You can also review various aspects of the offerings available and there are various packages, as well. The book list is excellent, also.Technical Remarks:This Web site is designed for ease of use. And provides excellent readily pracicable techniques that promote brain-storming and critical thinking. I think my participants will find using this in groups will be engaging, useful and fun!",5
538,"I have used some of the hand-outs, conceptual and curriculum reform proposals (translated into Spanish) and some of the awarenness activities in teacher education with postgraduate students and in-service teachers in Spain. They provide very useful insight for reflection, debate and collaborative learning.",4
538,"I have used the multicultural awareness quiz in my introductory sociology courses for years.  I have students take the quiz, then give the answers, and then we have a discussion about the items that students were surprised about or have questions about.  It's an effective way to get discussion going about social inequality in the U.S. today and a good change of pace from the usual sorts of classroom activities.",5
538,I looked through the website and clicked on the various links to find very helpful information.  It is pretty easy to follow and very well organized.  The content is very helpful. It is stated very clearly and helped me get a better grasp on some multicultural education material.I think the students will learn and become more aware of the different races and cultures that the world has.  It is very effective in helping me understand how to get all the diverse students to interact with each other which will help out any teacher also.  I am just a prospective teacher. I now have a place where I could look to in helping meet the needs of each student.  ,4
539,I really like how the video explains the concept of how she is using Flickr in her course as well as the students talking about how much they enjoy it.  I always think it is a good idea to incorporate things that the students can keep once they are done with the class.  The video also gives enough of the basic technical skills that you need to get started.,5
539,"I enjoyed the video, but the lack of captioning might hinder its use by instructors in the United States. As I am not fully versed in the Australian laws and regulations regarding the need for captioning, this might not be an issue for the contributor.",4
539,Case study explains how flickr sites were used to share and critique images online. Overcoming the fear of the technology enabled the faculty member to open up a new way of sharing and increased the amount of feedback on the images. Other advantages include lessening environmental impact by students using chemicals to print their images and saving students money because they don't have to purchase paper and chemicals for making images. ,5
539,The presentation in the use of Flickr as an online classroom was very inspiring!  The ideas shared could be applied to other visual arts.,5
540,"Another solid resource that deals with issues important to our planet. Once again, this resource is packed with images and is data-heavy.",5
541,I worked around with the algebra balance scales for about 35 minutes.  I found the simulation to be very helpful.  The visual effects were very graphic as the scale moves while you are trying to keep it balanced.  I thought the materials were accurately presented.  This simulation would be very effective in a classroom setting as the students can work through many problems with the visual effects of the program.Technical Remarks:The program displays great graphics and contains friendly navagational buttons.  I do believe that first time users would find the simulation to be easy to use and navagate.,5
542,This is a great resource to direct undergraduate students to for their initial research. It is especially useful if they are having difficulties choosing a topic or finding quality primary sources. It also helps them get accustomed to using the LOC.,5
542,"This site is very useful for students, teachers, or librarians looking for primary source materials. It would be an excellent resource for classes doing historical research or looking to include historical images into a presentation.",5
543,"This is really cool...I had students use this site and compare their experiences to when we did the iodine clock reaction in the general chemistry lab. It was easy to supplement the reactions the students ran in lab with the simulations.  Students could obtain more results without creating more waste or taking more time.  This simulation could even be used in place of an actual lab for classes without lab access or for distance-learning courses.  Here are two sample student comments comparing the two labs: ""I think I learned more in this lab than in the real lab.  This is the kind of thing I will remember for a long time.  Thanks  I would have liked to do more of this in the labs.""  ""I like to do hands on things so the lab was a lot more fun to me than the computer, but it was easier to see the concept behind the experiment on the computer.""Technical Remarks:The simulation works very well and was easy for students to use.",5
544,"This site presents an ecletic collection of materials pertaining to Human Anatomy. The most helpful portion of the site, in my opinion, is where the cross sections are presented. I also enjoyed reading about the case studies under ""Anatomy of first aid"". The content seems sound, although the student might have trouble navigating the site on its own since the different portions are not well articulated.I am using a PC running windows 7 and encountered some problems opening the videos on the ""Anatomy in a box"" section.",4
545,"These animations could enhance and strengthen the learning of students.  After teaching a lesson, as a teacher we could show a video clip to help students acquire comprehension on the topic such as how eclipese occur.",5
546,A succinct and accurate definition and explanation of abstracts and annotations. I could see this being useful as an assignment for students who need to write an abstract or annotated bibliography for a research paper.,4
546,"This is an excellent and easy to understand tutorial explaining the difference between an annotation and an abstract.  It tells the steps for writing each one, and lets you pause to review the steps. This is a topic that is confusing to a lot of students.Technical Remarks:Adobe Captivate",5

It is necessary to click “Workshops and Conference Presentations” to find it.http://www.nvcc.edu/faculty-and-staff/technology/tac/resources/#presentations This presentation, which dates from 2003, provides sound guidelines for creating learning activities/assignments. There is almost nothing that makes it particularly germane for the online environment.  The title gave me the impression that the presentation would discuss integrating Merlot materials into a learning activity. After viewing it, I have the impression that it was more about using Merlot recommended practices and guidelines in developing effective assignments.",3
549,Useful for faculty that need help building online learning assignments.  It has examples.Technical Remarks:PowerPoint,4
550,"This is an excellent site that provides insights into the professional etiquetteexpected when conducting business in 36 countries including the United States.Topics include:  negotiation tips, dining and entertaining etiquette, meeting and greeting, professional dress, conversation, gift giving, and scheduling appointments.Technical Remarks: Internet browser.",4

558,A very general presentation for the beginner.,3
559,"This site contains several animations that can be viewed online or downloaded for presentations. The animations typically allow the user to control the reaction by requiring them to hit a button to begin each step or move to the next step. There is also a repeat button if any review is needed. The polymerase chain reaction is presented in easy to follow illustrations and goes through three cycles. It is followed by a user-generated graph of copy number versus cycle that uses data from many more cycles. The gel analysis of polymorphisms, the application of pcr that follows, is likely to be unclear and confusing to the novice. The Southern Blot animation is presented as  a scenario that collects data that the user is asked to interpret.  Cycle sequencing is an animation of DNA sequencing and interpretation of electrophergrams. BOth of these animations are quite well done. DNA Detectives presents three true cases, two on paternity and one murder/rape, for the user to solve using DNA fingerprint data.They are rather simple to do. AcDs is nothing more than a basic discussion of jumping genes and the animation adds very little. Three Polymorphisms appeared only as three diagrams without any animations, so I am not sure what its purpose was.",4
560,This applet is similar to a few other applets by the same author.  Good graphics and explanations.  Lacks versatility.,3
561,The good thing about this site is it's a NASA resource and it's current. This is a good place to get up to date information.,5
562,"I spent about 4 hours sifting through this site and found it to be very informative. I have used information from this site in my own schoolwork and in building curriculum for my future students. The material was of excellent quality, and I look forward to using the information in my classroom. There are many possibilities for developing lessons that use resources from this site.Technical Remarks: The site is very easy to navigate. First time users may need an overview prior to working with the site, depending on their level of knowledge.",5
563,"I spent approximately 30 min. exploring this creatively interactive site on Escher the artist.  What a fansastic way to show the relationship between math, geometry, and art!  The areas of crystalography and tellelation communicated this concept.  The links allowed the user to learn more about his life and his works.  Technical Remarks: Overall this site was user friendly, however at times some of the tools were difficult to control.  It was highly interactive and very creative.  This aspect allows the user to not only observe but to learn with hands-on interaction!",4
563,"I spent about 35 minutes on this website. I love art so I naturaly gravitated toward this site. Escher is an artist that I am not too familiar with. This site helped me understand him better. I feel taht this site stresses creativity. Who ever thought math could get so ""artsy"". The site was very interactive allowing the user to create desighns. You start with a quad shape and manipulate it by adding balls, triangles and lines.This site helps a student  get in touch with his or her creative side. A child can learn that math can also be art. Technical Remarks:    The applet had some fun but limited interaction. While making designs I found it difficult to control some tools. This applet is not  photoshop, but then again its not supposed to be.",4
563,"I spent a little over an hour on this site (mostly exploring the web sketch) and found it to be somewhat interesting. I have read a lot about Escher so my standards might be a little higher than others. This site was very interesting however, it seemed to focus on the web sketch a little more than I expected. The quality of material was quite good, as well as the links to other Escher related sites. I think speaking about Escher?s work could make a very good lesson in many different math classes. It was a little confusing at times but in the end I found it relatively easy to use.Technical Remarks: A fascinating site if you want to know a little more about Escher.",3
563,"1. I spent about 20 minutes looking over the main page, and then I just skimmed the sub pages for additional information. I spent about 10 more minutes trying the tesselation activity on the main page.2. This page shows excellent examples of Escher mathematics such as crystalography and tesselation. I think these concepts are eduactionally significant because it shows specific examples of important ideas in geometry. It shows the the actual ""form"" of geomerty rather than just the numbers that you mostly are taught in school.3. I think that this site has a lot of good ways to enhance the teaching of geometry in the classroom. Such as the tesselation interactive game. It shows much more clearly how to do a tesselation that what a book could show you. here your actually learning and applying it at the same time.4. I found it rather confusing to use the tools in the simmutalor game. I pretty much got the idea of what they were trying to teach, but it was so confusing to use I gave up after a while. I think the game would be much more effective if the instructions for use were more clear.",3
563,"I spent a great deal of time here, probably over 45 minutes.  There is a lot of information to absorb.  The Java application used to draw repeating patterns was conceptually well done however i did have some technical difficulties(read below).  I think the explanations on the site adequately explained the details of the application and what was happening when you used it.  The site included linked resources as well which were informative.  I think that this site contains information that would be very valuable to furthering a students introductory understanding into both Escher and crystallography.  I believe that the materials were very easy to use however the server was down at the time of my evaluation and therefore I wasnt able to see the final products i designed.

The authors favorite designs page was not functioning properly OR i just didnt understand how to view the images; i only say text and a blank page.",3
563,"This is a terrific web page!  It is almost entirely about M.C. Escher.  There is so much information!  I spent a lot of time here.  There are a quite a few links that tell you all about his life and they exhibit several of his fascinating works.  They even have a personal letter of his displayed, that you can read.  (He sent it to his son after he became a knight.)  They also have a virtual section where you can make your own repeating patterns similar to Escher?s works.  (You make them by using dots, etc.)  They explain how to use it, but it is rather strait forward.  This page is a lot of fun and has a lot of history as well!Technical Remarks: This is a great site about M.C. Escher!  Many links to other sites that tell his whole life story and display his incredible works.  A great virtual section too.  It allows you to make your own patters using dots, etc.  This is intriguing stuff!  Check this one out if you need info on patterns, on M.C. Escher, or you are just browsing for fun!",5
564,"I found this resource to be incredibly helpful for my writing class.  Because I don't always have the time to do one-on-one writing conferences with my students, this tutorial walks the students through the writing process, showing them each step in detail.Technical Remarks:The website is very user friendly and easy to navigate.  Both students and teachers will enjoy using this tutorial.",5
565,"I have used this site for various tutor training courses I've developed as a means of introduction to learning theory.  The comprehensive list is more than students need for an introduction, so I would direct the class to specific theories (usually adult learning, constructivism, and operant conditioning, and have them read the descriptions, and then discuss with one another either in class or on a web board the relevance of the theory to the activity of tutoring. I introduce the discussions from a metacognitive perspective and encourage the peer tutors to begin to be aware of their own thinking processes and consider the implications that this self-awareness has on themselves and the students they assist.  I encourage the tutors to actively engage their students with this idea also, and help begin to develop a self-awareness of learning that transcends any direct discipline content. I have not used the Domain or Concepts sections of the site. Content is well-presented and thorough; includes good summaries and appropriated references.  Overall, a good introduction to a complex discipline, and one that would probably require some didrection on the part of the instructor, at least when used as a preliminary introduction.Technical Remarks: Direct and well presented; easy to navigate. Direction through the lists would probably be helpful to introductory level students.",4
566,This screencast is one module of 6 about finding articles. It describes the nature and use of each aspect of a database record.,4
567,Excellent program and follows the FESHE Model for professional development in the fire service.,4
568,This site is a great source of both information and exercises for instructors to use in the classroom.,4
569,"I used the site in a teaching-learning activity for a college science methods class. I found the site to be very educational and easy to navigate through. Even though I was required to use this site for an assignment, I most certainly will also use it to teach GM crops to my own students.",5
569,I used this site as a teaching-learning activity in a college non-science majors Contemporary Biology Course. My students had to review each activity in this site and write an opinion paper.  They actually thanked me for giving them this assignment.  They learned a great deal about genetically-modified plants.Technical Remarks: This activity is easy to understand and the interactive animation of making  genetically modified products is entertaining for the students as well as a useful learning tool.  The students'understanding of genetic engineering was enhanced by this exercise.  ,5
569,"I have used this web site to teach the concept of transgenic organisms to both college level biology students, for high school teacher-training workshops and to have non-science majors write a 500 word position paper on whether they support such technology in ourt society.  The simulation used to create a genetically modified tomotato plant is excellent and very interactive.  Students really seem to understand the general steps used to create transgenic crops after this simulation.  Other general information provided in this site addresses a number of other pertinent issues.",5
570,"The practice this would provide would be very helpful; however, the null and alternate hypotheses are not absolutely correct in the format that is required by this application.Technical Remarks:The popups provide a good guide to the students while they practice.",3
570,"I really like the algorithmic nature of this applet and that apparently students could practice for as long as they like. I've not used it in class, but might in the future. The hints feature and the popup error/warning messages are great.Technical Remarks:The applet uses the term ""Cast of Characters"" which I assume is the instructor's term for the statistics used in a test, but may not be generally known to students.",4
571,One of the best demonstrations of basic thermodynamic principles.  The corresponding plot is very helpful.  There is a great deal of explanatory text included.,5
572,I have been looking at your Scrolls for an hour and I am amazed at how easy the site is to use. I will definitely keep this in my collection to use in my classroom. It is a great set-up to compare the scrolls. I like that it is very interactive and student friendly. Thank you for such a great resource!,5
573,"This Prezi-based video explains information literacy, visually tracing an event through different kinds of formats. It also explains how different kinds of information sources are used. The closed-caption feature is also useful. I used this vido in my information and digital literacy course to explain the information cycle. Then I asked students to trace the information cycle for a different event.",4
574,"I need to review in more detail, but a first look indicates that this is a well written and thorough text book for an MIS course. It appears it may need some supplemental case studies to accompany the material.",4
575,"Excellent online resource to learn or review the five phases of instructional design. Includes activity, resources, and quiz.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate!",5
576,Needs spelling corrections before usable,3
576,Spelling corrections needed! Otherwise a nice tool.,3
577,"After spending close to an hour previewing the learning objects and applications I have found that a good portion of the material to be worth while.  As a high school algebra teacher I mainly was looking through the ""Intermediate Algebra"" section. The materials give a quality tutorial on different intermediate algebraic concepts with example problems to test knowledge. I would find this to be a great review activity before a test or exam. Most of the information on this site is Trial based and you would have to purchase it if you found it worthwhile. You may be able to get away with only using the trial learning objects.Technical Remarks:It was relatively simple to navigate through the material. Determining whether or not the trial will be sufficient will be up to the teacher and how students respond.",4
578,"I was quite impressed while I looked through your StAIR on significant figures.  I really enjoyed going through it and looking at the different ways in which you presented the material.  Being a chemistry teacher myself I know how tedious the discussion of those can get in a classroom but I think by using something like your StAIR it would become a far more enjoyable experience for the students.  I especially liked the interactivity you put into the program as far as the questions go.  I was quite amazed at how many different spots along the presentation that you presented a quiz to the student.  I think doing that really helps and really forces them to pay attention, especially since the sig figs can be quite specific in what you need to learn about them.  I also really liked towards the end how you made the user identify the rule they used when determining the right answer.  I think by doing that you really help to cement the knowledge even further.  Overall, I think it is a very, very well made activity. There are a few very small things though that I personally would have changed on the presentation.  First, and this is very much my own opinion, is that the sounds bothered the living daylights out of me.  However, my wife could hear them elsewhere in the house and thought they were amusing so I suppose they would probably work for students.  Again, that’s just my own opinion.  One thing though that I actually might change however, or perhaps include, would be a oral explanation to go along with the text presented.  I realize that could get out of hand quite quickly with the amount of text in the slides but I do believe it would be very beneficial to the students.  Perhaps only including it for specific slides that highlight key points would be a good and doable alternative.   Again though, amazing job!Technical Remarks:I actually don’t have any real problems on the technical side with this presentation.  I really liked that as soon as you open it up it directly begins the presentation.  I like the design and layout of the slides.  Everything advanced smoothly and there were no problems with navigation.  The only thing I could think of would be to include a navigation option somewhere towards the end to review each section of the material again if necessary or perhaps to include a table of contents where that was an option.  Again, though outstanding job!",5
578,"Great lesson!  I really liekd that you started the lesson with questions for the students to answer.  This will get them thinking about the material before you present them with the rules.  I also thought the questions throughout the lesson were very good and that it was a GREAT idea to have the students pick the rule they used.  The only one I thought may be a little confusing for students was 13000000.  It is not very common to have a decimal without numbers after it.  I understand that this will make two rules correct, but if possible you could make both of those a correct answer.Technical Remarks:The flow of the material was very good, if possible I would recommend a little more annimation in some of the slides so that students are looking at all of the material without skipping straight to the question.",5
579,"This is more an enecyclopedia than a textbook, but anybody who's working in Early Music should have it on their shelf.  The scope is enormous and the information is dead on.",5
580,great history on virology (with their virology time machine). Which they had more information on current viruses,3
580,"While this site provides an accurate broad overview of virology, it is not a comprehensive intro to virology. However,
it provides a fascinating historical prospective on the discovery of viruses, which I have used to introduce the concepts of vaccination in a general biology laboratory course.  The online experiment to determine the titer of a viral preparation could be potentially useful- however, an educator would need to cover concepts such as: influenza, titer, haemagglutination, antigenic type, and how these fit into the broader topic of immunology to students before they use this virtual experiment.Technical Remarks:easy to use",4
580,"There is no need to have your students purchase a textbook with this site available, since it is based on a well written published text and has many advantages over its source material. The site is attractive, easy to navigate and the author has kept the material current. There are plenty of full color illustrations, and relevant links (including a search engine) are present for each topic. There is a nice balance between discussions of molecular and medical/epidemiological virology. The biggest disadvantage is that one either has to read from the  screen or print a large volume of material. In addition, most of the material addresses animal viruses, although one can access material on bacterial and plant viruses. I have used this site as the reference/background text for my class since 1997 and the students prefer it to purchasing an expensive book.",5
580,"I reviewed this site for 30 minutes.  The quality of the content was very good.  It followed a course set up by the instructors.  It appeared to be easy to navigate for those taking the course.  As for those generally interested in virology, it was good and relatively straight forward.  The associated links were helpful and yet not too cumbersome (i.e. not too confusing or distracting).  The user interface was in general, easy to understand.Technical Remarks: It might be useful to have some streaming media effects added-e.g. viral infection of a cell or nucleic acid replication with in the cell).  But, this web site was excellent for those with a 56K modem.   The first time user should find this site easy to use.",4
580,"Nice summaries of various aspects of virology, with unique illustrations included.",4
581,"Excellent, easy-to-use tutorials. My students used the Excel tutorials and found them to be very helpful.",5
581,"Great use of videos to explain the different commands in Excel. The page is a bit distractful due to color and graphics, but the content is exceptional.",5
581,Very useful. Will use in an online classroom setting.,4
581,"One of the Excel tools this RLO explains via animation is the VLOOKUP function which is extremely useful in performing data suppressions.  When I first started in my current position, our group was paying our mail room to use a special program to perform data suppressions to our mail files.  While explaining this process to a friend, she mentioned an Excel function that could accomplish this same task in about 15 seconds (and for free!).  I jumped on the opportunity to learn how to use the function but while my friend’s verbal instruction made sense, writing out the step-by-step instructions was a challenge.  I ended up jotting down a very rough cheat sheet using screen shots and corresponding instructions that almost everyone in the office asked to photocopy at some point.  The VLOOKUP tutorial on this site not only takes the learner more accurately through these instructions, it also visually takes the learner through the steps, which my cheat sheet could never accomplish. If I had known about this RLO a year ago, it would have saved me a lot of explanations, frustration, and trips to the copier.",5
581,"Easy to follow tutorial videos of excel and word. Self-directed students would find these very helpful, especially for an online class.Technical Remarks:I would love to have had sound along with the videos. Not sure if my computer wasn't playing or if the sound wasn't there.",4
581,These are great little videos. The content is grouped into small chunks of information. This would be a good place for students to go and review information when they get stuck.,4
581,I like the video presentation -- it clearly shows the process and is more engaging than traditional printed instructional media.  The ability to review the material as frequently as desired is also beneficial.,4
582,I thought this was a great website. Even though I live no where near Monterey Bay I can still use the website as an instructional tool for my students. Some of the information I felt could have been used for middle school as well not just high school. I liked the graphics and the information they had which was very informative.,4
583,"The National Standards for Arts Education have been posted online by ArtsEdge at the Kennedy Center,  In fact, ArtsEdge has posted all of the national Standards at their site, if you are looking for them.  The National Arts Standards site is used regularly by my student teachers, graduate students, and the public school teachers with whom I work.  This site is clear and organized.  A Table of Contents, a Preface with Defining Terms, and Introduction (which I often use with my students to help them understand the rationale for arts education and national standards), and the actual standards themselves are all here.  The Introduction portion also has a section on Context and Issues that addresses nine big topics such as Standards Incorporate Cultural Diversity and the Standards Provide a Foundation for Student Assessment.  The information is very accessible and easy to locate.",5
584,I really like this site. This would be great for all ages of students. This site has a wide variety of information regarding astronomy. Students would find it easy to use and the animations make it appealing.Technical Remarks:I had no problems maneuvering around in this site. There is a lot to see and learn so guiding student's learning is a must so they are not overwhelmed with the amount of information.,5
584,Great way to show students how the contents moved over time.,4
585,This is a great site for learning about photsynthesis.Technical Remarks:There are no technical requirements.,5
585,Great for Bio majors but a bit too advanced for intoduction to biology non science majors,4
585,"I liked how the animation went step by step. By going though the steps it helps break down what each step is even further than just having examples, it spells out how each step works to complete the photosynthesis process.Technical Remarks:I wish you could make the animation larger so it covers the whole screen that way when showing a class it is bigger.",4
586,After going over all of the material in this webiste I found that it took me about ten to fifteen minutes looking at the information and writing down some important facts about the powers of ten and what they are capable of.  Writing down some notes was useful to me but there was not as much information as I had expected.  In the other website that I looked at there was more than enough information that I could write down but this website was limited in its powers of ten.     I strongly thought that the quality of the content was good but it could have been much better.  The website was fun to look at but it only explained certain numbers about powers of ten and not the basic numbers.  The examples that were given were about huge global numbers and a multitude of different things.  Some of the information was for a much higher learning of mathematics.  I felt that some information was not as detailed and some information was too detailed.     After going over this site I believe that this information will only enhavce the ability of the teachers and not as much as the student only because of the fact that teachers have a stonger mind set than student and teachers have a better understanding of what they are talking about.  Teachers are teachers for a reason and students only go to school to learn different things.     I believe that first time users will have an easy time finding and using this webiste because it is still easy to follow and the software is also easy to go by.,3
586,"The java applet loads with the page and starts the slideshow automatically. It offers some manual controls to speed up the screen refresh rate and provides read out of distance in scientific notation. The slideshow is the main thing, which explains the topic. I spent about 10 minutes browsing and could get a fair idea of what the author wants to convey.The website offers some breath taking views moving through 10 million light years in space towards the Earth in successive orders of 10. The site shows Exponential notation indicating a convenient way to write very large or very small numbers. The site also reflects on how scientists look at things using their eyes and also wide variety of specialized tools that give them extra capabilities. For instance, some objects are so small that scientists must use powerful microscopes to see them. Other objects may be very large but are so far away that scientists have to use a powerful telescope in order to observe them. Piecing together the information on utilization of the concept of Power of 10 is shown by its application to laws of Physics. This can be used more appropriately as an example of fractals in real world ? exhibiting fractal characteristics of self-similarity at different scales.It?s a hands free tool to understand the Powers of 10 using its application in optics. It is always easy to remember new concepts when they are related to something attractive.",3
587,"The simulation is easy to follow, but the results are highly unlikely.  There has to be more outcomes than all the wolves die, then the rabbits and grass reach equilibrium.",3

590,"This site is a support site for beginners and also for those that are reviewing algebra. The topics are well laid out and easy to follow. After a section is accessed, anyone can input the information and see yhe results of the calculations. I spent considerable time looking at most of the sections and I was the impressed by the ease of access and abilitiy to see the results. A student can check his work quite rapdily and easily.Technical Remarks: The site is well laid out and easy to follow. All the topics in algebra are not available now. The authors note that as requests come they will be able considered seriously. The site does not ofer details of the calcultions. This may not help a  student who is looking for more support. There are other sites that can support sucha a need.",4
590,"This site is useful for refreshers in any mathematical procedures. Personally speaking, it is great to be able to access any sort of problem and simply plug-in the question at hand.I spent about 25 minutes accessing different mathematical areas, from the algebra, to graphing and explored even some calculus inquiries. It appears to be a great ""quick fix"" for any sort of math questions. I do not think it is as great of a teaching tool as it is a learning tool...preferably as an at home tool for homework or tutoring.The usability is fairly cut and dry, the no-frills approach makes it easy to comprehend.",4
590,"I found this site to be very helpful and easy to use. I tooled around the site checking everything out trying to find something I could complain about, but my efforts were futile. At first I was bitter because I was thinking that I really could have used this site when I was in high school. It really is a fancy calculator like the homepage claims. After browsing for a while, my bitterness subsided because it dawned on me that I could still use the site even now.Technical Remarks: The creators of this webpage really planned out what they wanted to accomplish with this site. It's laid out very well and easy to use. I'm by no means a math or computer wiz, but I was able to navigate the site easily. I tried the algebra site and it gives you definitions and examples that are easy to follow. The neat thing is, you can enter your own problem and it will give you the answer, and if you are slow like me, it will let you click to see how they came up with that answer. Everything is in layman's terms. Some of the calculus was difficult for me, but that's my fault because I'm mathematically challenged. As I stated earlier, I really could have used this site in high school. There's a section that lets you plot graphs. You just enter the coordinates and it plots them for you. It actually shows you what the graph will look like instead of guessing. This program would be very effective for any student, but especially for someone like me who gets intimidated and doesn't want to ask ""stupid"" questions. I even e-mailed this site to my nephew who is a freshman in high school and he was very grateful because he found the site to be just as useful as I did.",5
590,"I reviewed this material by actually using the program.  I spent about one hour browsing and entering equations to be solved.  I was very pleased to find this ""shell"" for Mathematica here online.  I have been told that Mathematica was powerful, yet not easy for a ""liberal arts"" math person to use.  With this interface, I found it very easy to use Mathematica and I am sure I will revisit this site many times.The interface program seems flawless.  My friend, who is an electronic engineer, used it to show me several concepts in math which I had not previously understood, but now I do.  It is great for teaching!Technical Remarks: This program is a worthy enhancement to the Mathematica, and makes it usable for ""the rest of us.""",5

594,"I really like using this applet to demonstrate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. This applet is different from other applets on the same topic because it allows you to have to different sample sizes on the same page. It is very nice to be able to have a comparison between, for example,  the sampling distribution of the sample mean for n =5 and n = 10.",5
594,"Very easy to use. Clearly illustrates the relationship between the target population, the sample, and the sampling distribution. The animation helps students keep the sampling process more firmly in mind. The user can easily vary the target population to show that the Central Limit Theorem holds for an arbitrary target population. Also, it was much easier to use than other applets I found because you do not have to stop to type in numbers. The user can select different distributions, sample sizes, and numbers of samples easily with the mouse.I used the applet in my classroom to solidify the concepts I had already introduced through an actual sampling exercise in which each student brought a sample of 10 coins to class. We computed the mean of each sample together and I found it helped to have the applet to refer to the example and vice-versa. This applet is by far the best I was able to find on this topic, and will certainly enhance learning and teaching.",4

596,"This is a great example to help people understand how screen readers work. It is next to impossible to DESCRIBE the experience of browsing a Web page with a screen reader ... which makes simulations like this very useful in the classroom. Using actual screen reading software can certainly be a better experience but may not always be possible. Providing even a ""taste"" of what it's like using a screen reader certainly helps individuals to understand the user's experience a little better.Technical Remarks:As indicated, the simulation requires Shockwave Player. Being a Director developer myself it's hard to criticize this ... but it does occasionally make access more complicated since it is not as common as Flash player. Installing Shockwave Player on Apple OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) may be confusing for some. There are instructions at the URL http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/512/cpsid_51273.html (they were very hard to locate on Adobe's site).",4
596,"This simulation provides an eye-opening opportunity to experience the WWW from the point of view of a sightless person. As when using a screenreader, the content of the page is read aloud with no visual clues.  I've used this simulation as a demonstration in several Web development courses.  Students have responded with amazement.  They gained understanding of the need to include accessibility features in their Web pages. They also gained respect for the ability of people without sight to use the WWW.It's worth reading the explanation before trying the simulation. It is also possible to see the mock Web site, but it's better to do this after the simulation.Technical Remarks: It's necessary to have Shockwave installed.  It may take some time for the file to load, depending on the speed of your connection.Audio is essential since the Web page content is read aloud.  You'll need speakers or headphones.",5

Technical Remarks: The site encourages student interaction not just via rompting a few questions but by encouraging students to participate in scholarly networks. Among the questions are useful comparative exercises. The links lead to a wealth of meaty primary historical sources that enable the student to go beyond the superficial knowledge of themes that is, alas, too common on many websites claiming to teach history. In addition, there are links to a number of useful full-text journal articles. There is a nice balance across different periods. Some of the maps might have been a little sharper in focus.",5

606,"This website has extensive resources. Provides descriptions, links as well as other resources that one might acquire. Affords a variety of perspectives on the topic area from parent to practitioner.",5
606,"Wow! Excellent site. As a therapist that has worked with children with anxiety disorders I wish I had known about this site to share with my families. It covers each topic with valid information and in text that makes sense for children, parents, and therapists.",5
606,"This web site is great for parents, teachers, and professionals alike. I spent about half an hour reviewing the site and the links it offered. I addresses the issue of Child Anxiety. It defines the difference between fear, phobias, and anxiety. It explains the definitions, symptoms, and treatments of various anxiety disorders. There is a section of FAQ's that is particularly helpful for parents. In addition to the disorders, the site tells of age appropriate behaviors so that parents can more easily distinguish between them. It offers parents techniques to help their children as well as clinics and seminars for all individuals (children, parents, teachers, and professionals). Literature references are recommended to get a more indepth perspective. Technical Remarks: This is an incredibly comprehensive site. It's easy to navigate and appropriate for anyone regardless of their expertise. It is also a well maintained site, with all of the links in good working order. ",5
606,This site is a great source of information on child anxiety. I spent 20 minutes looking at the site and found it easy to navigate. It would serve as a wonderful teaching aid and help parents teach their children how to cope with stress and anxiety.,4
606,I spent around an hour and a half browsing and reading the website. I found that the content was very easy to understand and clearly stated. As a tool for teachers and students I think that this site would be very helpful. It also had some very good links. Technical Remarks: A first time user would find this site very easy to use. ,4
606,"I spent about 45 minutes to an hour browsing through this site.  The quality of content was excellent with good, solid advice.  It answered tough questions, such as, will my child's anxiety go away naturally, how do I choose a child therapist, and how do I differentiate treatment. It had information on many disorders, lots of links for related information, and resources for educational toys, CD's and videos for children.Technical Remarks: First time users will navigate easily through this website.",5
606,I reviewed the material approx. one hour. I found the material very informative and interesting. Any concerned parent or professional would benefit from reading the articles. Technical Remarks: The site was very easy to navigate through. First time users should not have any difficulties.,4
606,I spent about 1 hour viewing the material. The quality of the material was great. It helped me as a parent understand more about childhood anxiety. The material was also very helpful in showing helping tips for parents.Technical Remarks: The material was very easy to understand. It was also easy to access.,5
606,"I found this site very useful in finding services and general information on child anxiety disorders. I think this site provides accurate content, and could be used to supplement teaching on anxiety disorders.Technical Remarks: I think this site could have utilized pull down menus in certain areas to make navigation more efficient. I also think that providers should be listed on a zip code search system. It would make it easier to find the services closest to you without having to scroll through a list.",5
606,"I think that this site is a wonderful site for anyone that is interested in child or adolescent anxiety disorders. It is educational for parents,teachers,students as well as professionals. I think that it allows those that are interested in anxiety disorders a place to start educating about causes,symptoms and treatments. I really liked how they defined fears, phobias and anxiety as well as listed certain fears which are normal for certain age groups.Technical Remarks: This site was very easy to access,and easy to navigate. All the links were clearly defined and all directed the reader to the desired webpage. This site also allows for readers to get the information they want easily without searching through endless pages of information. All of the pages have headings that contain information pertaining to that subject and are easy to find",5
606,This is a very interesting and useful site. It is easy to use and informative. Technical Remarks: No technical problems found.,5
607,Great way to allow young learner or learners of any age to learn the basic elements of cell division and the concept of the control of cell division.  The learner feels they are the little supervisor and there is an urgency to get the process right. Very effective! Bravo,5
608,This is a completely entertaining site!  We use this to get students dancing and excited in the classroom.  Very easy to use and it generates lots of smiles.,5
609,The video provides a good overview of the information cycle and the topic is well documented. Students will relate to the topic and find it interesting. I prefer videos that include options to stop and restart the content and also to know the duration.,4
609,"Found this useful with both one-shot and multi-session library instruction. 
Serves as model for several other useful resources:

http://campus.queens.edu/everett/M2.html
The tool is widely cited as an exemplary infolit tutorial.Technical Remarks:Superior production. Lengthy but so well developed using parsed segments could be done smoothly.",5
610,I use some of these videos for my pre-service and Master's level teaching courses.  They provide a rich tapestry of examples for teacher candidates to discuss.  I would recommend them to others.,5
611,"Today, when radio has almost no presence in our life and we get so much information from visual images, it is quite an experience to listen to radio drama from previous decades, specifically the 1930's form of audio storytelling. In comparing the experience of the modern viewer to that of the ""old-time"" listener, the latter is much more active processing the information because he himself has to visualize the text.  Radio storytelling has faded and lost its popularity and its audiences in the 1950's with the arrival of television.

This site is an opportunity to create a learning object to generally familiarize the learner with the golden years of radio and with its grand priest Orson Wells.  In particular, I would like to select the War of the Worlds, which he produced one day before Halloween (1938) in which he changed the drama to sound like a news broadcast about an invasion from Mars.  I am convinced that today's passive ""couch potatoes"" will have some difficulties in the beginning to concentrate on an audio message, and will have to get use to comprehend a message that is not dissected MTV style, tailored to a short attention span.  Yet, once they get the ""swing of it,"" they will become active participants in a different, more imaginative way to understand reality. 


Another intriguing learning object could be built around the subject of the ability to move the masses with demagoguery, and the power of persuasion of the media.",4
611,"I downloaded three of the audio files in this series and listened to all of them.  I used the War of the Worlds file to design a lesson  for 12th grade students on the role of mass media in 20th century American history.  This site presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary use of the materials.  As I was designing my lesson it suggested an entire course on the relationships between history, literature, performing arts, and media technologies.  This site provides core material for team teaching across disciplines.The content is of high quality and there is a diversity of subject matter in the radio plays  that lends itself to exploring and surveying adaptations of specific works into other media.  The potential effectiveness of this material for enhancing teaching and learning is found in the flexibility of its application across disciplines.This material is probably not suited for learners who do not have abilities in extended attention and comprehension through listening.  However the experience of listening to a radio play is in and of itself substantial content for facilitating discussions about media, history, and popular culture.Technical Remarks: At two plus hours, even with DSL or cable modem, down load times are quite slow so it is advisable to download the file prior to using it for a lesson.Accessing the files was quite easy as long as Real Player or MP3 audio streaming is available.",4
611,"This site provides a very good information about The Mercury Theater on the Air from the 1930s.  Teachers and student teachers with whom I work are delighted with the selection of old radio dramas that are found here and many get ideas for K-12 classroom lessons from listening to selected shows.  The 1988 Leonard Maltin interview with surviving members (found at the bottom of the page under the Theater of the Imagination link) provides a solid cultural and historical context for radio dramas in America in the 1930s.  I would rate this site a 5 instead of a 4, but some days the server where this site is housed is down.  The actual content of the site is excellent.Technical Remarks: You need RealAudio or RealPlayer or a MP3 Player to effectively use this site. The old time radio dramas are available in streaming audio format or can be downloaded for RealPlayer or MP3 players. ",4
612,"I tested this Shockwave simulation for a few minutes.  It is very easy to use and runs smoothly on Netscape. (I never tried it on IE.)  This simulation, which is aimed at the nonscientific, doesn't requiere an assignment, as it is so easy to use that the student can simply try it out for themselves.",5
613,"This site conatins a minimal review of Marbry v. Madison (1 Cranch 137), and links (some working, some not) to other pages related to this, the most important Supreme Court case, ever. It fails to cover the complexity and importance of the case.",1
614,"Nice collection of links.  Also includes links to data sets that could be used and to class projects in the author's classes over the years.  Would be useful background material for someone developing a course in this area.  Would be difficult to use in a lecture.Technical Remarks:I assume that the students all gave their permission for these materials to be posted.  Also, are the links checked frequently?",3
614,"This site offers a lot of information on death and dying.  However, there is material here that might be relevant for other sociology courses.  For example, there is information on current debates in abortion and euthanasia.  I found it easy to locate information and I think students would be interested in this material.  This site includes research into a variety of different topics including differences by race, sex and so on.If you are using the site for a class other than death and dying, you mght have to provide clear directions to students on what you want them to review.",4
614,"The links provided with each topic are useful, but the rest is shallow and disorganized.",2
615,"Tutorials contain many features that make them engaging.  The examples used in the tutorials differ based on the user's selection of an area of interested, such as ""global communities"" or ""Internet business.""  The incorporation of Flash technology, along with audio and great visuals, does a great deal to keep the user engaged.  Moreover, the quizes at the end of each module provide users with immediate feedback as to whether the key points of the tutorial were firmly understood.  

The only drawback is that each of the three modules takes approximately 30 minutes to complete, which makes it difficult to incorporate them into a single, one-off bibliographic instruction session.",4
615,"I like the format of this site.  It is straight forward with different types of delivery.  It is interesting with the text popping up on the screen. And each topic is relatively short, so someone could pop in, catch a topic and then go on to something else, but come back later and pick up on the topics they missed. ",5
615,"TILT (Texas Information Literacy Tutorial) provides a means for students to choose a current issue of interest to them and as they work through the tutorial they learn about libraries, information resources and research.  Each module begins with a list of objectives and then provides opportunities for students to build their research and critical thinking skills as they follow the discussion and in some versions they are provided with assistance as they search online databases and library catalogs. A review at the end of each section reinforces what has been covered and provides additional learning opportunities. Students are also given the opportunity to reflect on what they have learned by responding to the question ?what is the most important thing you have learned from this module??  When incorporated into course software such as Blackboard or WebCT, students have easy access to the tutorial and professors can track its use.  Libraries can customize TILT for their users and SearchPath  is one example.  The Librarians at Western Michigan University have added a couple modules, but have made them shorter than in the original TILT version.  They have also added more excitement and interaction by using Flash.  In a recent class where I introduced TILT to the students and had them do one of the modules, they commented that they found it fun and helpful. This tutorial is a good supplement to library instruction sessions and students would benefit from completing the modules before the actual class time.",5
615,"I browsed each module and completed two of them through the quizzes.  This software covers all aspects of a course in information competency, including an overview of the internet and its limitations as a research tool.  It also stresses the importance of selection and evaluation in utilizing sources for both personal and academic purposes. The software would be best used as a review at the end of each online or face-to-face teaching module.  The learning objectives are geared to a higher education audience level having little or no research experience. These objectives are stated at the beginnning of each module, and the practical examples given in the tutorials provide seamless interactivity.Technical Remarks:The software requires little technical support, and flows easily.  Each screen includes easily read buttons that move through each module or allow for exiting.  Menus and text are readable and present information in an attractive format. The software also provides a means for relaying quiz scores to the instructor. One drawback could be the speed in which the material is presented on each screen, allowing very little time to read the text before moving on to the next screen.",5
615,"Strength(s):   This Tutorial was highly interactive with goofy but fun games to keep the learner involved in the learning.  I was pleased to see the IT style of learning (teaching to the test) used for both instruction, and testing knowledge.   Concern(s):    Although, information may be useful to some students, others may have had prior knowledge making this tutorial very basic and not envolving to the students with prior expirence.Technical Remarks: Had some troubles navagiting on some pages.  I needed to reload my web browser.  Quizes and general learning were fantastic.  I was very pleased to see that the quiz results could be emailed to a professor who had assigned this to their students.",5
615,"Overall the site was very well done.  I am amazed at this site because it would be a great source for students.Technical Remarks: Well done, sometimes a bit misleading, but good set up.",4
615,"In each module students will learn concepts and practice them through interactions. At the conclusion of each module, they can test their comprehension and receive immediate feedback. Each module takes less than 30 minutes to complete.",5
616,"This is an easy to use site and the assignment that I use challenges the students to apply information from cell and molecular biology courses to a real problem, that is identifying an unknown virus based on describing tests to be performed. It is surprising how few can actually describe how to determine whether the genetic material is DNA or RNA when first confronted with the problem.  The overall usefulness of the taxonomic key in identification is compromised by current molecular techniques (probes and sequencing) that can more quickly provide the desired information.",4
617,"This learning exercise is an excellent way to teach critical visual literacy skills. Using Japanese woodprints as the informational context, the tutorial guides the learner in extracting and inferring meaning based on the visual cues. The exercise then adds text, guiding the learner to understand how dual coding adds to meaning.",5
618,This is a very impressive set of applets. I used the hydrogen spectroscopy applets in an assignment of a survey course for non-science majors.  They seemed to have no trouble figuring out the user-interface.,5
618,"This is a highly regarded site, and well worth the time.  Check it out.",5
619,"If you are looking for primary sources to assign as reading for your students, you can certainly find them here.  The basic arrangement is by year.",4
620,Very helpful,5
621,"The site is easy to maneuver through. It is essentially an interactive powerpoint presentation for students to practice effective use of ""I"" statements.  One thing that is a little confusing is when you first click on the ""go to materials"" link, it looks like you have to download a pdf.  Just scroll to the bottom of the page and look for the Yellow Next button on the very bottom right of the screen.  Well done. ",5
622,An excellent teaching tool for students in Electrical/ Computer Engineering.Technical Remarks:The animations is excellently done. It is even very amusing for the instructors.,5
623,"This offers a nice option for students to practice identifying components of a hypothesis test. I would use the p-value approach rather than the rejection region approach. A link is provided to have you switch to the p-value method.I don't like using ""r"" to count the number of successes. This is very confusing and some students might mistake this for the coorelation coefficent. ",4
623,"A tutorial that is not especially useful. It uses critical value rather than p-value, so I would not use it in my classes.  It uses r for the number of successes rather than x.  It does not explain very well what it is asking for.  Students must be given a tutorial before using.  For example, when it asked for ""p"", I thought it wanted me to solve for the z-value and get the p-value.  Actually it was asking for the proportion for the sample.  It uses ""reject the null"" rather than talking about ""evidence of a significant ..."".  It does not indicate whether or not my answer is correct.  I might have used this twenty years ago but in my class, this tutorial is out-of-date.",3
623,"Students often have trouble identifying values that go into a formula from a word problem. This applet provides practice.

I would like to see a table with critical values included",5
624,"This is an extensive site that focus on the eye anatomy and associated pathologies. The site is not easy to navigate and it is not visually appealing. That being said, the content is technically sound and the pathology slides are very thorough, although I wish the slides had more information on the pathologies.There is a video in the site that is not visually enticing to the students. Overall it would be helpfull if all the images had a caption attached. I wouldn't recommend the site to my students but I might use the pathology slide show in future classes.",4
624,"Very good site.  The information of the eye and eye diseases was accurate and helpful.  The color and field tests were fun to take and the pictures of they eye were excellent. The quizzes were ok, but feedback would have been useful.  I intend to use this site to incorporate the pictures of eye diseases when I give lectures on the eye.Technical Remarks:Easy to use and navigate within the site.  Organized well.",4
624,I feel this site is a good learning tool for a high school classroom. I particularly like the image of the eye with the parts labled and links to that part. This site will be useful for students who want to learn the basics of the eye.Technical Remarks: I think it would be better if the site was translated into other languages.,4
624,"This site can be very useful in a high school classroom.  In a high school anatomy class, a teacher can use this site as a replacement for the eye unit.  I am going to divide my students up and have them research one part of the eye.  Then they will give an oral presentation to the class on there topic.",4
624,I thought the material was very informative. I thought that there was alot of good information to teach to your class.Technical Remarks: I think it would be a good learning tool for the class there is a very good diagram of the eye that is labled well. The material was easy to use.,4
624,This site was very informative and fun. It took about 15 minutes to navigate through it. The quality is excellent.  It could be used very effectively as a teaching tool.Technical Remarks: Links were clearly labeled.  Graphics of the eye were good.,5
624,I spent about 20 minutes reviewing this site. I read the material and then I did some of the testing excersises in order to become more famillar with the site. The model of the eye used along with the information gave an effective understanding of the organ. I think that if a person uses the material to its full potential they will leave with the basics on how an eye functions and the different parts of the eye. First time users should have no trouble with borwsing the website.,4
624,"I loved this site and found it just as I was involved another course that involved the eye, so it was of great benefit to me. There are so many different links and tests to take that you are surprised at how much you learn.Technical Remarks: A very easy to navigate site, very student friendly  especially for the first time user.",5
624,"I spent around twenty minuntes brousing around this site. I found the material to be helpful in aiding classroom lessons on this topic. There is a good learning potential for a student researching this subject. Some of the descriptions are involved, but with this topic, they have to be.Technical Remarks: I found this site easy to navigate. The links are clearly marked and defined. Also, the graphics are well done, easy to see.",4
624,"I really enjoyed looking through this web site.  Because of such interest, I spent about an hour researching the material. This content had perfect quality, This site not only described all about the eye, but went as far as labeling and showing a picture of what they were talking about. I feel This site would teach many people about the human eye that they had not known already about it.  Very educational, and easy to obtain the information.  Technical Remarks: This web site was very informative, education, and easy to follow.  I thought this site was easy to get to, and sufficient information to learn about.  ",5
624,"Very informative site for anyone interested in learning about the eye. There is a ton of information about the eye, its parts, and even tests on your vision, such as a color-blindness test. I think the site would be perfect for anyone needing to learn about the eye, regardless for what reason. For a student needing to study different aspects of the human eye, there is a great deal to look at.Technical Remarks: The site was very easy to use and understand. For anyone unfamiliar with terminology, there is even a glossary of terms within the site that defines nearly everything.",5

It was interesting to see how decisions on when to launch and budget allocation by division impacted the stock price, the net profit and the net profit per channel.  Thought the simulation was engaging.  You were provided feedback from the CFO as you moved through the simulation.  I would have liked, however, some explanation as to how my decisions impacted results rather than just my score.",4
627,I believe this site has ALL the assessment tools I would want to use at the undergraduate level.  OUTSTANDING!Technical Remarks: Easy to navigate - with applications sorted by department.,5
628,"I like the idea behind assisting teachers in creating their own classroom environment. However, the interactive classroom did not appear to function as I could not set up the virtual classroom.

Users have the option of first reading through a text-style tutorial, and then testing their knowledge in either a series of randomized questions from a large selection, or in a systematic path from beginning to end that prevented jumping ahead (dependent upon each sections design).  Topics are presented in a sequence that is logical to the subject, but different sections may be selected at will.  This site was reviewed for part of a lesson plan assignment; it took several hours to travel and learn from the entire site; it would be great to use it in the classroom.Technical Remarks: An exceptional variety of learning techniques were used in this site.  The amino acid structural building graphics, and all of the equations and chemical formula, exhibit different approaches for all types of learners and not a typo to be found.  There were no troubles in switching amongst its numerable relevant topics, and its use could be adapted for students preparing for tests on their own or for classroom use.  Concepts and models are not only educationally significant; they are highly relevant and very well done.",5

I looked at this site over the period of about 15 minutes. I think that this site would be fascinating for young people and, as an adult, I also found it quite interesting.  I think the materials raises several issues and concepts that are important with regard to economics, particularly consumption, and variances in geographic areas, allowing the instructor to lead into a more intense discussion of these issues and concepts.I was really impressed by the notion that the technology captured my age and geographic location and referred back to it with each example to make the examples more personal. This kind of feedback captured my attention and held my interest.  For those of us who remember better with action and visuals this supplement to learning will greatly encourage and enhance memory and association.Technical Remarks: The material was very easy to use. Good directions were provided aside from that which is designed to be intuitive.

633,"The content of this site is easily understood by students in introductory science courses. The material accurately shows the impacts of factors such as education to fertility. The graphics are easily understood and greatly enhance the site. The site is an excellent tutorial for introductory general biology or environmental science classes that discuss trends in human population, although it would probably find application in many other disciplines.Technical Remarks:The program runs without any problems and the graphics are small enough so that there is not a significant amount of delay over a 56K modem.",5
634,"Well made videos of real people in real-life situations. The next best thing is for the learner to be in those situations. Content is very relevant for everyday life.

What does the domain name tell you about the authority of the site??	What do the links within a site and the presentation of data tell you about the objectivity and professionalism of the site??	What are some ways to verify the information using other Web sites?This works because when investigating ""evolution"" students invariably encounter resources that expound beliefs and teach dogma as opposed to testing theories with scientific evidence.",5
636,"I thought it was one of the most user friendly applications for linear regression.  I liked that the students had the ability to move the potential least squares line to what they might think it would be and then have the actual prediction line post.  I also have concerns about the formula used for the outlier section.  I skipped that part of the application because I did not want to confuse my students.Technical Remarks:When plotting points, after clicking the box to plot points, I would have the program clear out the entry field in order to add new points.  This way there is no confusion about what has been entered.",4

650,Considering that this is not meant as an online course it provides a good collection of links and information about a specific topic during a specific time period.  It would be a nice augmentation to an American 19th century history course.Technical Remarks: Considering it's purpose I'm rating it at 3 stars.  This is medium quality because the site construction is not highly user friendly (navigation tools) and parts of the offering are inaccessible (no alt text or method for visually impaired to learn about the images).  It is however very simple and not difficult to use.  I'm concerned that some learners would get lost or need assistance with objectives.,3
651,"I only had a chance to look through it briefly, going through the main menu (the links), probably for about 10 minutes or so, and so far it looks pretty useful for a student taking an Algebra course. I looked at the links provided, and it's pretty useful for both student and teachers who want to review the algebraic concepts.

The content is pretty simple to use. Under the main menu, there are links that takes you to the different concepts, which provides an brief explanation about what it is, and then continues on to show examples of how it is used in the math. It takes you from angles and circles all the way to vectors, and although it is not as thorough and detailed like it would be in a textbook, it does provide to be a good reference. They even have math games and riddles for the student to ponder and try out as well.

It's effective as a reference, and maybe a brief study on the concepts before taking it head on in a math course or text. A student can prepare him/herself using this site.

The layout of the site isn't as intuitive as other sights, so it might be a little harder on the eyes to navigate around. But once you've learn to navigate around, it makes it a lot easier for you to bookmark and figure out where to go.",4

654,"The presentation of Physiological Events at the Neural Synapse by Barbara Lang was a brief and clear presentation of material that may be useful for nursing students. Review of this physiology in the visual movement format can be helpful review for nursing students in both fluid & electrolyte study and in Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) pharmacology studies.Technical Remarks: Quality of content ****The content is basic but does give an associate degree-nursing student a clear picture of basic physiology. This understanding of neural action serves as groundwork necessary for analysis within nursing process when administering ion based drugs and electrolytes. I would use this with my nursing students in medical-surgical courses and pharmacology courses as review and scientific physiology underlying many of the rationales for their nursing actions.Potential Effectiveness****As a simple review of neural cell action it is effective in reminding the learner of calcium channels and sodium channels, neural transmission and enzymes that inhibit neural reponse.Ease of Use ****The program is a two button progression with possibility for review by the learner. The buttons are easy to see and quickly responsive to the next frame. The action of the ion molecule in most frames is helpful for the learner that has a visual need for chemical physiology. Many students have voiced that chemical physiology, done only in words, is too vague for memorization--these moving pictorials of ions-in-action at neuron and cell walls will be helpful. Towards enhancement of this presentation this reviewer would suggest a glossary of terms and reference button to access terms would be helpful. Also,
 a few links to sites beyond this basic content to more applied/advanced bio-chemical physiology and pharmacological uses of ion physiology might start to advance the learner towards application. ",4

660,"I really thought that the research Adam did made a lot of sense. If you give employees a sense of being needed or importance, they will work harder. If they really are able to understand that the work they do truly does make a difference for the bigger picture then they will not only enjoy what they do, but want to show up everyday.It's always nicer to see firsthand that what you're doing is helping others and not going un-noticed. People, even though they may not admit it, crave recognition and validation that they're doing a good job.",4
660,The task significance podcast provides an interesting look at changing how managers think about employee motivation. The employee is not purely operating out of self-interest and can be motivated to work harder if they see the importance of their work.

It's such a great example of task significance by Adam Grant.

Employers should incorporate this idea into their workplace to create a healthy work environment.",5
660,"I love the idea that we need to connect more with people we work with and for,for me working in retail I feel much better and productive if I make somebody satisfied and if I don't look just how to convince them to spend more money but rather to get the benefit from the product.",4
660,"Adam Grant discussed the importance of task significance, and how it benefits the working environment. It makes everyone have the same priority and a common goal, which in turn leads to a more unified work environment.",4
660,Great Example by Adam Grant on Task Significance-  University Call Center (Higher staff quit every 2 months) Standard script and constant rejection.  The more money they raised the more students we're able to attend college (via scholarships).  With the rejection and lack of positive motivation or any motivation at all the downward spiral continued.  But with the use of Task Significance and positive motivation helped the volunteer staff feel better about the work being done.  The staff workers got to hear and talk to students that got scholarships and how they made a difference in their lives.Technical Remarks:Very Clear Audio.  No Problems.,4
660,I agree with Adam Grant with what he mentions about the importance of task significance. It is often not considered in the work place as important. I agree that a job high in task significance or where the workers are reminded or know that their job is helping others would bring out more motivation in their work. The extra motivation results in an increase in quality of work as well as speed in how they work.,4
660,"The example of life guard is really interesting. Beside the stories of how life guard save peoples's lives, life guards sometimes can answer swimmers' questions on how to swim better. They can get satisfactions from teaching people too.",5
660,"I agree with Adam Grant about the importance of task significance, and the effect on job performance. Employees in high task significant jobs tend to be more motivated, and when introduce directly to the people who benefit from their work, their motivation and job performance increases dramatically. However, I believe task significant has little or no effects on employees in low task significant jobs, and probably will not increase job performance.",4
660,Adams Grant's results were impressive but some jobs are boring and mundane especially if you accepted a job because that was the only job that you could find at the time and you're not really interested in the anything else but paying your bills.,3
660,"As Adam Grant stated in the podcast “Task significance” is very important to show to employees that what they are doing will have an impact on others people’s life.  In that way, they not only will be working to accomplish the organization goals but they will be satisfied and more motivated to work when they know they are doing something valuable for others. As Grant said, there are two dimensions of personality and values on people and they react differently to high task significance jobs, they are: a) the conscientiousness and b) the pro-social values. The conscientiousness type of personality workers will accomplish the task assigned to them, however, they do not care about the “extra value” that carries that task.  On the other hand, the pro-social values type of personality workers do care about the “added value” to their job and they are more compromised with the organization and because of that they are more responsive and have more productivity than the conscientiousness worker when they are put to work in high task significance jobs. The organization structure has direct impact on how workers perform their job. The different ways that organizations  are structured (vertical,  divisional, matrix, team-based or virtual network)affect employees and their performance,  Moreover, specialization might play against the organization in accomplishing its goals since employees are isolated and do a single boring job. In that case, the employee looses sight and the importance of his job and how others benefit from it.  In order to motivate this employee, the managers must give him authority and responsibilities or show them a few examples on how their job it is important to others. My question is, how to motivate low skill jobs  workers?",5
660,"I liked the podcast because I can definitely relate to it. One of the things that I could relate to was communication in the workplace. Working at Wells Fargo, we always get feedback from customers and we all get surveyed. It's really nice to get good feedback. Our manages make the phone calls to customers to follow up as well, and its great to hear from your managers that you are doing a great job. Little things like that encourage people to do better; a little recognition goes a long way. It's a good way to keep people motivated at work. Every job gets a little boring along the way, and letting people know that they are doing a good job and to keep up the good work, is a great way to keep them doing their job better, because it makes them want to keep doing a good job.",4
660,"The interview conducted by Michael Johnson with Adam Grant was very interesting in that it brought to light an issue that many never think about: the positive impact of work for others. Grant notes that most employers believe their employees to be self-interested and, as such, try to motivate them with perks such as higher pay, interesting work, and promotional opportunities. In fact, most people are not entirely self-interested, but are looking to make their lives meaningful by working to benefit others. I found that it made complete sense for Grant to say that employees are more motivated when they can actually witness the positive impact that their work has for others. I especially enjoyed Grant's use of Microsoft as an example of this. I was, in turn, inspired myself upon hearing the story of workers who create scholarships for students.",5
660,"Adam Grant's talk on the dramatic effect of task significance on job performance was a very interesting article.  His studies were an excellent source of information when trying to add motivation to a work force.  Every job eventually becomes monotonous and tedious; task significance is the perfect way to keep the motivation alive.  I have worked for numerous employers, and I always worked best when I knew that my work was being appreciated.  When we feel that our work is not being appreciated, then we tend to put less effort into our work.  The two examples he used were the lifeguards and the alumni sponsors, and they were perfect examples of how task significance plays a huge roll in the work place.  As Adam Grant concluded in his studies, showing task significance to employees always raised work productivity.  I believe that all organizations should take the time and show how their employees how their work is appreciated.  As Adam's work showed employee productivity was increased, so for this reason employers should always use this.  Adam Grant did not really go into detail about how often task significance should be used.  I guess it would depend on the type of job that was being performed.  I would believe that the more task significance the better for both the employee and employer.",4
660,"Task significance is a good idea because like Adam said in the video, anytime employees are doing something that mames a difference. If those employees know how and why they are doing this work, it could benefit and increase morale. I also liked how Adam talks about when he used to work in the travel company and how the editors were never really able to meet the readers of their guides.  If those employees were to meet those readers, they would have been able to get more expirience, motivation and research about what those readers might want to see more of and less of.  It is true that if an employee knows their task significance, they could and most likley would work more effectivley.  I personally work in a bank as a teller.  This job is not the most amazing.  The problem up until recently was that we were always told get refferals, more sales, more sales.  Though just hearing this we don't understand how and why this benefits the company.  Why would the company choose quanitity over quality.  Though when you move up in the ranks you get exposed to more information and see the true side of why a corporation asks for certain things, in this case referalls.Sharring stories and expiriences down the piplelines from managment to employees increases the morale and really makes one work towards a purpose.  That purpose in turn will continue to improve and benefit consumers, readers, and anyone that benefits or uses products or services of a company or corporation.",4
660,"I enjoyed this podcast a lot.  I know that I feel the same way when performing my job.  When I do my day to day job without any member contact, sometimes I end up getting bored or uninspired.  However, when I am able to help someone out over the phone and make their life just a little bit easier, it makes me feel good and appreciated.  Especially when feedback comes in on just how much you were able to help someone, it makes you want to keep that same level of service or even surpass it for the next member so you can impact their lives as well.  When you listen to a study like this it really makes me believe that there are more and more genuinely good people out there who really do want to help others and are not just all self-interested.  This approach should be applied to more jobs out there, including the government.",4
660,"Task significance by Adam Grant was very interesting and informative. It's amazing how the mind works, and just seeing your final product can really make a difference. Knowing about task significance in your business can really help you out tremendously. Your employees would be more willing to make better products or perform at a higher level just by you being aware of the circumstances.",4
660,"I found the topic of task significance to be very interesting. As someone who does want to make a difference and have a purpose in life but not necessarily let my job or work define my entire life, it is nice to know that a person's job may have high task significance regardless of job titles, such as CEO, supervisor or manager.Even a lowly data entry personel can still contribute a lot to his or her company. It was also fascinating to hear about how motivation and productivity can be boosted just by showing employees how they positively affect those around them.",4
660,"After listening the interview podcast with Adam Grant, I do agree with him that task significance is important to job performance.  Task significance will change the workers performance and personal view on a particular duty for good.  But task significance can only go so far during real life situations.  The employee have to be very responsive and want to help others, with introduction of task significance, the employee will have a boost of performance (ideally).  Again, this is solely depends on the person.  Task significance can only boost performance on employees that are WILLING to go the extra mile.",5
660,"I completely relate and understand the content of this podcast. Durning my 8 years in the military I completed 3 tours in Iraq. There were many days while in the military that I felt my work was not necessary or appreciated. This left me feeling uninterested in improving or striving to do better. Even this  type of service faces the problems mentioned in this podcast. Ensuring your employees feel gratified with their work is difficult in any field, even those that you'd think it was a given. I never felt like what I did mattered until I came home and was faced with friends, family and acquantinces that were highly appreciative of what I did and the time I spent doing it. To this day when my time in the military comes up people thank me, this is gratification that I did not receive while serving.",4
660,"Task Significance is such an important part of job satisfaction.  I know from personal experience.  Being an admin for a team that works in Securities, I know my role makes a difference to my team, in that the small tasks I do, play a large part in the overall picture.  I think in addition to Task Significance, appreciation, relevance, and being part of an integrated and cohesive team, all play a part in job satisfaction and sustainability.  Who wants to go to work everyday to a job that they do not feel makes a difference in peoples lives.  Knowing that I make a difference, makes it easier to get up every morning and drag myself into work. ",4
660,"The Podcast on Task Significance was enlightening and informative.  I can totally understand how showing employees how their job isn't just ""a job"" but it is an integral part of the organization as a whole can make a huge difference in employee motivation and moral.  When someone has a vested interest in the success or failure of an organization it can only be positive.  Those employees are the ones who will work hard no matter what.  However, that isn't always the case.  Not all employees have a vested interest so as Adam Grant said, it is for those employees that Task Significance is most beneficial.  And getting them connected to the work that they are doing day in and day out can only be beneficial to the employee and the organization.",4
660,"I agree that what we do should reflect our knowledge and understanding; it brings much more significance and satisfaction into an individual's work. Also, employers should evaluate their workers' job satisfaction from time to time to identify causes which might lower productivity due to unadequate satisfaction in what they do.  ",4
660,My first experience with this material was on Task Significance Interview with Adam Grant. After listening to his definition on task significance and examples of it really helped me understand the concept. His personal experience was great and making it more helpful to understand the concept of task significance.Technical Remarks:The instructions to the podcast was straight forward and easy.,5
660,"It's interested to learn the task significant has so many possitive effect on employees' performances. I think if a employee know there work can help people or customs, they will more appreciate their job, and work harder.  Thus, a positive task significant will motivated employees and improve the produtive of the company.",4
660,"It was interesting to learn that invisible task significance can have an impact on employee motivation. This makes sense because people like to be acknowledged for their hard work and if they do not see that positive impact on customers, employees may feel like they are working for no purpose. I think it is a good idea for employers to stress the importance of task significance to their employees so they are motivated, as shown by Grant's study. Employees are more productive when they recognize the task significance and will be more willing to work and feel appreciated.",5
660,"After listening to the interview of Task Significance, it definitely made a lot of sence on how a work force, should behave, to have interest in the company's success as well as individual growth in the company, and to have a motivational drive to make you want to do better. The people responsible for motivating theri employees are the manager's it's there job to do such, to up lift peoples spirits an not let it dwell and making the lack interest and end up making big mistakes that could lead to consequences.",4
660,"Grant showed me really interesting way to motivate myself and other people. I would never think of it. I have always thought that a person must love the process of doing the job, or perhaps a result of the process, but it turns out that the basic appreciation from the consumer of the service would have as much effect. After the interview, I am putting myself into shoes of different professionals and thinking how the consumers would benefit - it really should work well.Except of politicians, where the final consumers are going to hate them anyway:)The only thing is, that I couldn't really connect this interview with the text as it is stated on Ilearn.",5
660,I think that task significance has a huge and psitive influence on jobs' performance. it remarkably helps the workers to work together and in a good condition to achieve their goal which is the satisfaction of the customers. Task significance is considered as a kind of motivation for the employees to well- serve all the stakeholders and the society where they live.,4
660,"I enjoyed the interview of Adam Grant pertaining to ""Task Significance"".  This was the first time I have heard about Task Significance, but after, listening to the interview with Adam Grant, I have a very clear idea of what task significance is and I think it is a very important concept to the work environment.  I can learn to apply task significance to everyday situations and it will definitely give me a whole new outlook in life.  I definitely believe that when we are doing something that benefits others and make them happier, we are ultimately feeling better about ourselves also.Technical Remarks:Overall, this was easy to use and I would recommend others to use this.",4
660,"I think the subject is interesting, but self intutitive.  If it came from the angle of neurochemistry or changing paradigms in post modern philosophy... then this subject will have some 'meat' to it.",3
660,"I think that task is very interesting. the work is really benefit for other people. Health workers, safety workers and educational workers all do great things for society. while working for the job, u are not only haining what u need but also help other people out",4
660,"I thought Grant was outstanding.  A very good communicator.  I can clearly see the difference in jobs I have had myself, where I was in direct contact with those who needed my services.  it was much more rewarding, and pulled on me to do a better job.  Its also due to the rekognition.",5
660,"I truly enjoyed what Adam Grant ha dto say about task significance and I think not only does task significance create that feeling of accomplishment, but it also makes the worker more motovated to do their job better and at a consistent level.  I also believe it creates innovative ideas amongst employees. A perfect example of that was his example of Microsoft and how they created a user friendly system to see how well customers can navigate and of they had issues they knew where it was and how to fix it.  In business we often focus on the techinical side of things point a and point b and how to get there, yet we never really pay attention to the interior motives of employees or even customers. Unless, you work in customer service we neglect to see the humanistic side of business and I feel that it is really important to focus on that.  Adam Grant focused on a soemwhat emotional facet of business by asking are we happy or satisfied with the work we do? And if you are, why? And if your not, again why? I believe this is extremley vital in creating a successful business and if I ever in the position to affect change ( which I feel we almost always are) than I would love to put something into effect as Adam Grant has.",5
660,"According to Adam Grant, task significance has a huge influence on productivity and motivation. I would agree that when anyone can see the result of their work and the positive effects it has, they are guaranteed to work harder. I've noticed that among the companies I worked for, some were very good at stressing task significance while others just focused on production, numbers, and sales goals. Almost every time the company that showed us how and who and what we were affecting by doing a good job was more successful. Whereas morale in the numbers focused environment always seemed to fail and usually their production wasn't as high. I like the concept of using stories to motivate like the ""Volvo Saved My Life"" testimonies. Connecting the workers with the receivers of their services seems like a genius idea to me.",4
660,"Task Signifigance is very important for employee motivation. Having worked in remedial to management jobs, I have seen first hand the difference in employee performance due to task signifigance. Most people are goal orientated and when you show them the signifigance of their roles in the company, they usually are more deticated to their jobs. People like to rewarded for doing good work and are encouraged by rewards. An example is when companies award employees with promotions or just a change of title. A worker is going to perform better when given the title of shift leader or head sales. Some employee strive to be Employee of the Month because it gives them a sense of accomplishment.",4
660,"This idea of Task Significance is brand new to me. I have never heard of, let alone given it any thought. I think that more and more managers should adopt this concept an incorporate it into their motivational techniques. When employees understand the impact of their work in a ""real world"" scenario they are more likely to care about their work more so than if they view their job as some menial task that, ""just pays the bills"". I think that exposing employees to customer testimonials would be a great way to create excitement about their work and provide more significance. When employees understand the impact that their job has on other individuals in the world, I would hope they would pay more attention to detail and do their job to the best of their ability.",4
660,"I immensely enjoyed the interview of Adam Grant.  Although this is the first time I have heard of 'task significance,"" his explanations made a lot of sense.  This applies not only to our jobs but also to any type of activities we do on a day-to-day basis.I believe having passion on what we do stems from having a feeling of 'purpose.'  People may hate coming to work because they feel unappreciated or it feels more like an obligation because that's what they get paid to do.  However, if people are reminded or showed that they are making a difference on somebody else's life, this would give them a sense of 'involvement' resulting on a whole different perspective.  Our awareness of our contribution to the society raises the stake much higher therefore, we feel much more accomplished and motivated.",5
660,"Regarding task significance, Adam Grant is very knowledgeable. I agree in that many people are not recognized for the work that they do. Often times, it goes overlooked for many reasons. When people are driven, they work harder and harder. People in high task significance work more and more motivated--they're more effective in their jobs. This is a great thing to keep in mind. While this is information that I think that anyone could concluded, I do think that it is great that there is actual research on this topic",4
660,"Great podcast on Task Significance in the workplace!  It puts into perspective not just how managers should effectively motivate their employees through task significance, but also how employees should find task significance in what they do.  I agree with the author when he says people with high task significant jobs are motivated and find their work more meaningful. I work at a private school as a HelpDesk IT guy and I do find task significance in what I do.  I feel that helping teachers and students deal less with technical issues leads to a more effective teaching and learning environment.  As a result, teachers are less distracted allowing smoother academic lessons, and students are less frustrated and more focused on the lesson at hand.  Though I rarely get a thank you or feel appreciated for what I do since I've become ""absorbed into the day-to-day routine of work"", I know technical help makes an impact. I also know someone that has been at Cisco for 5 years as a Computer Engineer and they say they hate their job with a passion.  Though this person is well payed, has been promoted a number of times, and has had plenty of opportunities to learn and develop, this person is not motivated or enthusiastic about what they do in any way.  This person feels that their job has no substance--meaning they feel no social or positive impact in what they do.  Currently, that person is looking for a career that has greater pro-social values such as a teacher, herbalist, or a calligraphist.Cheers,Clarence M.Technical Remarks:Had issues downloading the Task Significance Podcast through Firefox on the Mac.  Used Safari instead and it worked.",5
660,"From my understanding the purpose of task significance, is to make the employees feel their work is important. This is a good approach to motivating employees, it gives them an incentive to try their best. This is, i think, a better incentive than say commision. Employees motivated by commision tend to be more deceptive in their approach, but when the epmloyee believes in what he/she is doing then they wont go as far as deceiving people in order to do their job.",5
660,"Task significance, as the name implies, is what you do in your work life that benefits people as and the community as a whole. High task significance is correlated to job performence. The more you know you are benefiting others, the more you will want to produce a better product or do a certain task.  Adam mention the life guard example, where there were intervention by expirienced lifeguards and what they did to motive younger ones. Another example was Volvo engineers coming together with drivers in the ""how Volvo saved my life"" and discuss how they survived car crashes. If you really think about it, of course knowing your doing is befiting people, you will increase your work performance. If my cars are saving peoples lives, I will keep that up and make them even better.But what about the other end of the spectrum? Take a big nice company like Nike. Sure, I think managers are happy to know that many people in the sport industry use their product because they are the best. Nike probably likes that kids are using their products to get into sports or just have a good time. But what about the kids in sweat shops in China? yes, I am talking about the ones that are making the shoes for the kids elsewhere. Where is the task significance there? I agree with the point adam brings to the table, but I think there is a certain level in the business world where people just plainly care more about the money they make rather than what benefits they are bringing to the world.",3
660,"I thought Adam Grants ideas on task significance made a lot of sense. It can help companies improve certain products that aren't working out for the general public, for example, the Microsoft product he mentioned in the interview. Six users didn't know how to use the new product and later was successful when the creators met the users and talked about the product. I agree with what he said about the positive impact on employers as well as the people that benefits from their work. He talked about automotive engineers and their job to keep drivers safe; medical researchers and their findings to help patients; authors and writers who benefits the readers by writing interesting books. If companies and their employers take the time to meet the people who benefit from their product or services, it can help both sides. Employers will be successful as well as consumers benefiting from their products and services.",4
660,"This was a very interesting and beneficial post. The understanding of  specific task organization is an important one. Listening to Adam speak about this topic reminded me of many task that we all perform everyday and don’t realize how important they are to everyone. Example bus drivers have to keep constant concentration through out the day, one wrong move could be the start to a big problem. It is very important that management reminds employees of how important their jobs are. Management working together with employees to make sure they are focus on their job.",5
660,"Task significance enhances corporate adaptability because it encourages and motivates positive changes to the wellbeing of the greater society, where corporate identity and intrinsic reward surpass material gain and corporate interest. This is an arena of job design that seeks to make social contribution that bring value directly to the people. In the process, it redesigned a corporate culture in a way that allow corporations to adapt to changing needs. Employees are self motivated to make social contribution and hold responsibilities that surpass those commanded by law and ethics because task significance helps to reinforce the idea of intrinsic reward in making postive changes than in the pursue of corporate interest alone. Through promoting awareness in societal needs and fact that corporations cannot be viewed as separate from society, task significance helps to attain adaptability by tailoring business processes to meet changing needs.",4
660,"This podcast is very interesting. Professor Grant explained the""task significant"" term very well.",4
660,"I fully agree that employees who work in high significance jobs will be more motivated, satisfied, and excited with their job. For employees who do work in these highly significant jobs, I would find it hard for them to meet all these people who's lives they are influencing or saving. Volvo's idea with the ""Volvo Saved My Life Club"" is a very good idea for keeping their engineers motivated to keep pushing the envelope in new innovations. Most companies might not be able to afford such programs to keep their employees motivated so it is easy to see why so many people are not motivated with their current occupation. Managers are continuing to to find ways to reward and show employees how their work actually does affect lives hoping that these ""success"" stories will keep employees wanting to do more and more. Mostly this interview was telling us what we already know, you hear about stories on the television when someone almost died in a fire, and a few months later they get to meet their savior. These are great stories, but not all of the time are these saviors rewarded with getting to meet these people who's life they saved.",3
660,"This would be a great material about task significance related to organizations today. I am sure employees who work in hign significance jobs will be more motivated, satisfied, and excited about their jobs. No one would like to keep working on his/her job without satisfactory.",4
660,I really enjoyed this video. I also have had an experience with a high task signifance job that challenged my attention. I believe the theory was spot on because I know from personal experience that this could have made a huge difference in my job performance. I am excited to use this theory for my own personal benefit in the future. I believe others will too.,5
660,"Teaching the awareness and benefits of task signifigance for management in the workplace could prove to be very effective for employee motivation.  As a manager, the constant challenge to keep the average employee motivated to produce is always a top priority.  If the employees had a connection to how their work actually helps the recipients, this could improve morale and overall job satisfaction which would in turn improve productivity.  Mr. Grant has a very inspiring and useful concept.",4
660,This is a great study about task significance related to organizations today. I think it's very useful for management team to apply to their organization in order to motivate employees,4
660,"I do believe that task significance is very important to one's job. Like myself, I definitely would like to be involve in an organization which not only focus in making profits but also focus on how they could make a difference to other people. The task significance wether it's visible or invisible to others helps motivate employees do their job well because they know and could see that it not only benefit them but also the people that they serve.",4
660,I had never hear the term task significance before so this podcast was more informative for me. After listening to it I feel that I understand the idea and I am able to relate it to several jobs that I have had. It makes complete sense to me that people loose motivation when they do not see the benefits that people receive from their work. I also like the suggestions that were made about showing employees people that receive the benefits but also having other employees share their own stories. I would recommend this post to anyone who feels unmotivated in their career but also anyone that is thinking about entering a management position.,4
660,"This podcast on ""Task Significance"" is very interesting. I never knew the actual meaning behind it, until now. I find that it makes alot of sense to motivate employees and making a difference within a working enviroment will not only benefit the company itself; but it also contributes to satisfied employers. Ultimately, being a win-win situation for both company and employees.",5
660,"I liked Adam Grant's story about his research about the relations between the manufacturer/producer and consumers of a product. It is very important to eliminate any kind of misunderstanding between users and producers by  using different techniques of interacting (Microsoft developers have watched regular users to understand what kind of difficulties these users would face using new softwear, for example). First, it will benefit end users as they wold get what is user-friendly and with a clear concept of practical use. Secondly, producers may be motivated when they see the result of their professional activities. Hence, eliminating gap in communication between producres and end-users would benefit both the staff of a company and their current and potential clients.",4
660,Its  quite interesting to see how he connected scholars to scholarship receipiants and how they could raise more money and recieve more replies. I think we should also have that kind of motivation for students in classes so that it can motivate students to be more creative and also face tough course curriculum. I think motivation makes a lot of change in various work places and school is one of the best places to teach students who can make a difference in tomorow world.,4
660,"I was inspired by the interview with Prof. Adam Grant since I have never considered how the effect of task significance reflects upon one’s job satisfaction. I agree with Dr. Grant about the dramatic effect of task significance on job performance and satisfaction. I found his observation that every job has a task significance, but many jobs have an invisible task significance very interesting. I was also impressed with his solution to the problem. His research suggested that by revealing the invisible task significance to the employees their job satisfaction and productivity increased. From my personal experience I can speak to that overwhelming effect of task significance on job satisfaction. I have been under the influence of task significance throughout my career without realizing that impact. I started working as a mathematician at the beginning of my career. This job definitely has a lack of task significance since its beneficiaries are totally invisible: in this area of research one can only rarely observe and experience any positive effect on the well-being of others. Later on I moved to a teaching job which definitely has a higher degree of visible task significance but it is not comparable with the task significance of my new profession, nursing. So, subconsciencely I have been moving in my life from a profession with a very low task significance (mathematician) to one with a very high task significance (nursing), where I can enjoy directly the positive impact of my work on the people I am serving. Conclusively, it is hard to underestimate the importance of Dr. Grants’ research on demonstrating the hidden task significance to employees in respective professions and the corresponding increase in their job satisfaction, performance, and productivity.",5
660,"Segment was well-produced, engaging, and informative. Interview with Adam Grant shed light on aspects of modivating employees by increasing awareness / connectedness to task significance.  Although there may be some Hawthorne effect (simply paying attention to employees may improve productivity), Grant makes a strong case for making sure employees connect with those who benefit from their work.Making content like this available in podcast, so it can be digested while exercising or traveling, is great for busy students (especially those already working and going to school).",4
660,"Task significance is not something I think of when I think of management. That is a problem, because when task significance not apparent to workers, the employees will not be as motivated. When managers make task significance highlight and show how the work employees do will benefit others, employees are highly motivated and excited about their jobs. Without task significance employees won't see how their work is paying off or the people that are benefiting, and a company would not be successful without encouraging managers to praise the worker's task significance.",4
660,"This Podcast is very comprehensive and easy to follow.  I did learn something new from the Podcast other than the materials from the textbook.  I never realized the importance of employee motivation and task significance.  It is true that it makes me feel more motivated if my job/task makes difference for the others.The Q&A approach used in the Podcast makes it easier for users to remember the main points and ideas.  However, I’d suggest creating some sort of outlines or transcripts for offline review purposes.Technical Remarks:I'd like to be able to download a copy of this Podcast.  It is in Quicktime format, so I can't download it unless I have QT Pro version installed.",5
660,"I was completely unaware of what task significance was until listening to this podcast with Adam Grant. I am a Resident Assistant in the dorms at the university I attend. I now realize my job is high in task significance. After listening to this podcast, I took a look back on my past performance with the residents in my building and the events I put on, and realized that I had not put enough effort into it because over time, I had become bored with my job, due to lack of participation from residents. I am now taking a step back and going to put more effort into the events I hold for residents, because they do make a difference in their lives, and that by putting more effort in, the participation from residents will increase. Adam Grant's definition of task significance and his examples were great and have helped me grow as an employee.",4
660,"This interview was very interesting because I find that it correlates to how I have felt about my past and present jobs. For example, I used to work as track marshal at an indoor go-kart track, at first it was exciting but it soon got tiresome. The job offered no mental stimulation; I waved a flag and made sure people put their seatbelts on correctly. A later job I had was as a welder, for me it was extremely stimulating. At the beginning of the day I would be given a specific task, anything from welding railings too fabricating motorcycle parts. How I would accomplish my tasks was up to me, so I was not only doing physical labor but also problem solving. I would often be so enveloped in my work I would forget to takes breaks and even when my boss would make me I couldn’t wait to get back and continue working. Everyday I would get to work as excited as one can be at work, and try my best with everything I built.",5
660,"I agree that the job that has more task significance means it's more meaningful and the employees are more productive because it means that the job you have it's pretty important and may affect others a lot. Most employees are most likely to help others, and it does affect those people who are being help with.  ",4
660,"I've never knew what task significance really meant.  It is rarely mentioned, but after listening to him, it really taught me how motivation is really important to an employee.  At first when we start a job, we get all excited about it, but after awhile, you get bored and you lose the meaning in your work.  And if we can all get motivated like the way Adam Grant says, it is a way to put us back on track.  Most of us are never thanked for our work, and we feel unappreciaed, but even if one person said thank you, it would make our day that much better and we won't feel low and tired of working that extra few hours at work.",4
660,I think that in order for employees to perform their best that employers have to make sure the best is required. A lot of times in order for employees to give their best effort there has to be an incentive or a requirement. I think that if mediocre work is required than mediocre work is what the employer will receieve.Technical Remarks: ,5
660,"I believe, task significance is important at a workplace. Having a really important task can make you feel, you are actually contributing to your work and not just another employee. I never realized how auto-workers don't realize how they make an importance in one's life. We probably do take them for granted because they work for us and without it, some of our cars might never be fixed. I think, task significance is a way for companies to keep their employees motivated.",4
660,Such a great podcast.  It can be related to all different fields. I never knew what task significance was or how important it is. I especially liked the correlation between task significance and motivation about the travel books.  I also liked the life guard examples.  It really shows the everyday jobs and how task significance relates to them.,4
660,"After listening to Adam Grant, it made me realize how much of a strong correlation there is between motivation and performance. It was interesting to hear that motivation can be affected by external processes because I always thought it was only based on the individual alone. I think Adam's approaches to close the gaps between employees performance and the effect it has on the community is a great approach manager's can use in terms of their OD activities. For example, they can conduct survey-feedbacks on a regular basis in order to pinpoint where their employees' mindsets are at and what to do in response to that in order to improve performance.",4
660,"In regards to the Adam Grant’s interview, I believe that Task Significance should be encouraged in any business. When employees loose their interest and drive to work for their company. Their quality is seen through their products or services. That can cause significant change in a company, either it be good or bad.  When an employee is motivated and understands how valuable their job is. It causes an effect of importance.  It demonstrates to the consumer or recipient of the good of service that there is someone out there that cares for their well being and best interest.  It also demonstrates to the employee that they are someone important in a process of achieving a goal that will create a positive impact to society.",4
660,"I found the content interesting and very believable. Someone within the workplace will become increasingly less motivated if they are not receiving the proper feedback. Included in the aforementioned proper feedback is not understanding the task significance of their job. Not understanding the positive impact a certain job is having on the general public will indeed dampen someone's opinion of their job and the work done within this job. On the other hand firefighters for example, constantly seeing that they are saving lives and keeping people from harms way is a constant reminder of task significance. These types of jobs lead to a more motivated work force who take pride in their work. Increasing task significance increasing overall satisfaction and overall happiness with an individuals job and therefore leads to more conscientious performance. A person who is conscientiously going about their day and performing to the best of their ability will bring great reward to themselves as well as their company.",4
660,"I think Adam Grant has a great explanation on task significance and I can describe that it is an identifiable piece of work affects, or important to others internal or external in the organization. Also, an employee's knowledge of other people's dependence on the work they are doing is very important factor in the job satisfaction. Task significance is in the Human Resource, teams and training subject. Adam also talks about the dramatic effect of task significance on job performance. After I listen the interview from Adam Grant, it helps me a lot to understand how important test significance is. It is important because it teach me how to improve working performance and make it more efficiency. We also need to contribute internal and external in the organization to be successful on task significance.",4
660,"Grade Podcast, even if you own your own business!!",5
660,"The interview on task significance by Adam Grant was a great podcast. He brought up extremely important points when it comes employees making a difference with their work. He also brought up good points about the employer and motivating its employees. I have seen many times we're employees just do their job to do it and not really care about it or care to do it well. I do think it is an employees job to care about their job and do it to their best ability, but I also believe that when an employer gives initiatives it helps motivate the employee that much more. Employees are not always self interested and Adam's idea of showing the employee how they make a difference is something i think can really change a lot of employees work ethic.",5
660,"I really think that people need to take more responsibility for their own choices and actions. We are slowly becoming a nation where we must cater to the unnecessary emotion ""self-pity"" (for lack of a better word) needs of others in the work place which takes away from time in which we could become more productive and make the business more successful. What I mean by this is, if you need more motivation to actually do your job which you AGREED to complete upon being hired (without actually researching completely) then maybe you shouldn't have applied for the job in the first place.No one should have to make you feel like your job matters to make you successful at it, if you can't set your own goals and create your own motivations then don't apply for the job simple as that. It isnt anyone's job to be your parent and tell you what a good job you are doing 100% of the time in order for a person to be an adult and take responsibility. If self-esteem is the problem then perhaps there is another route a person can take OUTSIDDE of the work place. This may sound harsh but we live in the real world and it is my personal belief that we should act accordingly.",3
660,"I think the whole task significance thing is common sense for all human beings. However, people are blind or dont want to see beyond their actions. I love the approaches that Adam Grant suggested employers to use to motivate their workers, because I think they could be very effective. Those methods will allow the worker to see beyond their actions and the work their perform. If everybody were to be aware of the bad or good results of their own action, people will have a better judgment when deciding how to do get the things done.Technical Remarks:I didnt have any problem ",4
660,"This is a great episode of this podcast.  After hearing about task significance, I realized that where I work can have high task significance, at AT&T. My coworkers and I joke about changing peoples lives on cell phone at a time.  It's great food for thought on how you effect others lives.",5
660,"I really enjoyed listening to the podcast.  I thought the idea of showing employees how they make a positive impact, in the lives of the people they help, very interesting.  However, I wonder how various health care professionals, especially a hospice nurse, feels after providing care for a dying patient.  Would Adam's concept of task significance work in every profession.  Also, I wonder how long the effect of task significance last among various professions.The task significance concepts seems really simple, but very informative.  More studies should be done using task significance among other professions such as prison guards, funeral service providers, and service men and women.",4
660,"Interesting, yet at the same time predictable. I think for the most part, and perhaps I am speaking on my own behalf, it is in human nature to feel compassion for others. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit it, but I don't really go out of my way on a daily basis seeking to help others... But, when I do so, I'm left with a satisfied feeling.If my job impacted people positively (which it currently does not, unfortunately), I would definitely feel more motivated to work harder, perform better, etc...",4
660,"This is a very interesting concept that needs to be studied more and developed to be able to implement it as a practical procedure routine in organizations. At my current job, bridge engineering, we try to keep ourselves motivated about the importance of our job since the state department doesn’t appreciate all the time and we don’t have direct contact with the users, commuters. I hope one day, top management in department of transportation finds out how important our job is and start encouraging us instead of giving pay cuts w/o attentions.Ali Jenabzadeh",4
660,"When I was in the Navy, I worked on a ship.  At first, it was exciting, and new.  Over time, it ended up becoming repetative and boring, and it felt like I was just going through the motions.  By the time I was ready to get out, I couldn't wait to get out.  Nothing could keep me in, I wanted out, and to get to college.  I was consistently passed over for awards that I knew I deserved and constantly given extra work as a reward for getting my work done.Hearing this guy talk about these jobs and experiences, it makes it clear to me that people need to have that positive outlook as well as positive experiences within the job.  Maintaining a positive outlook is difficult, but needed to keep people in a job, paying attention, and actually enjoying what they do.  A task that is way too difficult when the ""leadership"" doesn't care about the people as much as they should, and doesn't try to find ways to motivate them.",4
660,"This was a great podcast to listen to. I believe that task significance can be very motivating for all employees and everyone who is involved. Task siginficance jobs help others first, they all want to stay positive and motivate each employee, no matter what position one holds. There are a lot of jobs that lack ""task significance!"" Seems that some employees or companies, like to make money, but are not even motivated to make their customers happy. It's about the sales not customer satisfaction. I dont understand how people can be satisfied with just a sale, instead one should be more happier about serving a consumer. People will work harder and become more positive if Task Significance is more present in the workplace.",5
660,I think that this is a great podcast! It is such a unthought of idea to actually enjoy the work that you are doing. Alot of people now just get jobs to have jobs and make money but it would be so much better if people enjoyed their work! I had never thought that some people working within jobs that make a difference but never see the people who are getting the benefits. If these workers were able to met a few people who had benefitted from the products that they make then their jobs would continue to hold a high positive impact on the workers individual lives.When work is meaningful then it makes the workers preform more highly and it also keeps the employees more motivated to work! I now will try to apply these principles into whatever career that I choose to work within.I agree with what was said about how managers need to try to motivate the employees to work more and also these managers should show how their jobs benefit other people!,4
660,"Task Significance: Interview with Adam Grant Adam Grant had a great point in explaining about task significance. We as students, employees or both must make more of a effort to understand the benefits of what we do daily that can motivate our reason to be there. We can be in school studying to become a nurse or mechanic, or as employee working as a server in a fast food place. If we understand what we do there or in a way helping people it tends to make the person involve work harder. I have worked in the bio-tech industry for 8 years, and also a part time student. In the beginning I saw my job as nothing more then a paycheck. As I move up at my in my position and started to understand my job more, the motivation in enjoying my work with up. Knowing that the clinical trials I worked on can help people that are sick made me understand the important of what I do.Technical Remarks:Employer should put more effort to training and let the employees know their job are helping people.",5
660,"I could not agree more that knowing your ""Task Significance"" is directly linked to your motivation in the workplace.  I was not ""saving lives"" or ""diving into the deep end"" but I was creating all the wireframe graphics for New Features Guide that shipped with every single release of 3D Studio Max 7.  While working on this project with Autodesk Inc. I soon became tired and unmotivated while creating these wireframe models that helped illustrate the new features of our software package.  Every model was very similar and I only worked on my little pieces and never got to see the big picture.  It was not until I had the opportunity to see the page proofs in their entirety which beautifully integrated all of my graphics with text, images, and image captions that I became 150% re-inspired to crank out the best possible work and keep it fun!  I also had no idea at first that MILLIONS of these booklets were going to be printed!  To this day I still think they were hiding the importance and scale of this project from me simply because I was still an intern working away for little to no money in comparison to the amount of revenue these software packages (Priced at $3,000++) will bring into the company.If I were running the show I would have these interns coming right into the print shops, looking at previous New Feature Guides and right on the front line of the entire effort towards the new release leaving them wide-eyed and ready to dive in and contribute to the success of their team and company as a whole.Now that I run my own design firm and production company I REALLY know how significant my work was on that project.  My company would charge 10's of thousands of dollars to work on a print project of that scale.Cool and relievent pod cast,Thanks",4
660,"Listening to the podcast interview of Adam Grant opened my eyes to a different point of view. I do believe employees start losing interest in what they do when they don't directly see the benefits. For example, I work at Starbucks and at times i feel i keep doing the same tasks repeatedly. Until customers tell me that they might be having a horrible day, but it all changes when they come into Starbucks. When i hear that kind of feedback i definitely strive to keep on doing the best i can do. If other employments could show employees the difference they make I'm sure they would perform better and be motivated to stay.",4
660,"I agree with the gentelman that did this study. My friends are unenthused about their work and careers; and, it is because the don't beleive their work makes a difference or helps anybody out. If employers emphaised to workers that their jobs help people out, performance would be efficient and done well.",5
660,"Well after listening the interview with Adam Grant, I would like to say that I agree with him because the theory of task significance is very useful in the business field.  This is something that happens with many employees that will have motivations to help each others.  Most of the employees are willing to help people that need their help.  I believe that if everyone is willing to cooperate in a company this theory will be a great success in the working environment and the company will improve and expand much faster. ",4
660,"I really enjoyed the Task Significance segment of this podcast.  Motivating workers through showing them that their work has value and merit seems like a logical step in the move away from seeing workers as solely self-interested.  I don't think the concept is very new (we already knew for example, that charity work and giving donations leaves people with a higher sense of self worth) but the interventions were brilliant.",4
660,This is all about taking it upon yourself to make a difference through your work. It also touches of the fact that you can burn yourself out and lose sight of why you have chosen your work. It's all about motivation and self-drive to continue to your work.,4
660,"I like this podcast a lot. I learned a lot from it. I think it is a good idea to connect the users with the helpers because I think it can make a difference. Motivation is key to working hard and to stay motivated in a job is hard. At first when enter into a new environment at work, you're excited but once the work becomes routine and all you're hearing is negative feedback, the worker will loose focus and sight to what they're really there for. People find joy when they know they've helped someone; it will keep them motivated to help other more in the long run. However, if they feel that their works make no difference, they will treat it as another task that they have to get done.Definitely it is a good idea to match the two.",4
660,I really like this podcast on task significance. The material was interesting and very easy to understand. I would reccomend this website to other students who have the management course or in management major.,4
660,"From listening to the podcast, it reaffirms why I think if you give someone meaningful work and also give them a challenge to stimulate their minds as well as keep them happy via benefits at work and provide them management that is there to insure order but not intimidate you will give them a good reason to stay in your firm.",4
660,It was interesting how Adam Grant mentions showing lifeguards examples of other lifeguards who've saved lives in order to motivate them.  I feel at times my work is meaningless. Listening to this podcast on Task Significance really struck a cord with me because I thought of my own motivations at work.  It made me realize what I produce actually affects internal staff as well as the community. ,4
660,"Task significance is incredibly important for employee morale, motivation, and productivity. Believing in what you're doing, that it's meaningful, and that it makes a difference in other people's lives. It reduces employee churn, increases performance, and increases their self worth.",4
660,I found it interesting that there is invisible task significace in that car makers don't get to see the drivers of the cars they made. Task Significance is very important because it affects work for other people. This podcast is very informative for the workplace.,4
660,"I thought it was very interesting that he pointed out that task significance is important in employee satisfaction and morale.Technical Remarks:As soon as I found which podcast was the right one, it was fairly easy to listen to it.",4
660,I found this podcast interview very interesting.  I agree that providing gratification in a job will directly effect the productivity and success in the workplace.It is very important for people to know that the job they are doing makes a difference.,4
660,the explanation is very useful. i can understand that how important motivation is to job performace. having a positive impact on the the onther is on of the motivation. people will feel happy if they think they have done something meaningful and help the others.,4
660,I thought that the task significant podcast audio was great. You get a new view on how work can motivate their employees to do more work. Listening is the key in any environment in order to get great results. People like to be listened to see what can be improved within the work environment. The friendly work environment can help create a better work place for the employer and the employee.,4
660,Great explanation of how people understand that their work impact others. Task significant motivates companies and employees to do thier work and see that how thier work could benefit others. It makes people more interest in thier job and work harder.,4
660,I enjoyed this explanation of task significance and how it should be implemented within businesses.  It is more meaningful to employees when they are aware of who is benefiting from their day-to-day tasks while at work.  Especially among those occupations with high task significance. ,4
660,Adam Grant clearly and effectively explains the definition of Task Significance. There were suggestion on how to intervene in order to improve Task Significance in the workplace.,3
660,"Grant's interview was both touching and significant in my personal opinion. His interview spoke volumes to any of us who have ever had a dead end job. He says that no one has ever done a study on task significance versus task monotony of workers in a call center. Many of us have had dead end jobs, like the example in the call center where we may have not seen the significance, however those call center employees were more significant to the university than perhaps the lifeguard at the university pool, although the public perception of those two jobs is entirely opposite. Grant also states that work performance would increase if the employees actually saw their work as significant and would take a pride in their job rather than just see their job as a way to pay bills. Employers that can give this knowledge to their employees stand to be better off than those employers that cannot.",5
660,"Grant's discussion about Task Significance reminded me of our readings about social responsibility. In addition to providing benefits to you personally, the externalities associated with performing whatever task you do can benefit those around you within and outside of the organization. Well delivered.",4
660,"I think this podcast is great , i learn a lot from that.Mark  Adam did a very good job , it is important that we can learn more about financial decisions and stuffs that we don't know if we are not looking on this web site.",4
660,"I think that this interview really gave me a great idea about work experience and what to look for when going into the business world. Also, I think this podcast helped me understand the responsibility of employees and how their jobs helped them and benefit others.",5
660,In this video. Adam talks about Task significant is doing somethingwhich benefit other people. Motivation and task significant have relevant with each other. Motivation plays an important role in the workplace. Task significant are determined whether employee can be motivated to do job better.,4
660,"The Podcast on Task Significance with Adam Grant was extremely interesting. He defined task significance as any job that has a positive impact on other people and mentioned that many jobs do but that the people performing them rarely have the opportunity to see the positive effects they have had. For example he listed journalists who write articles but who never see the positive effects it has on the readers, or those who manufacture and develop pharmaceuticals that save people's live but who never get to meet the patients they have effected.He alluded that if opportunities are provided for employees to see the effects they have on others that it will provide motivation to work harder, longer and generally promote greater happiness and personal fulfillment for employees. I agree, though many of us may say we like to be selfless and do not need to see the positive results of our hard work to be honest it doesn't hurt. When someone can put a face to a person's life they change it will motivate them to continue to do good. Adam Grant's research was very interesting, conclusive and highly valuable.",5
660,"The podcast ""Task Significance, interview with AdamGrant"" is interested for me. Also, I agree with his opinion. In the company, highest postion has most power and responsbility. Manager's strong sense of responsibility and self motivation can affect their employees during the working time. Employees and the mamager are both interrelated and interact on each other. The motivation for the decision is the desire to improve the serivce to the customers. Values are most sustainable and owerful motivation.Those examples are clearly analysis the employee's working quality to help the manager to adapt his work. I think the mutable motivation brings adaptablity that can help the company become more successful in their field.",4
660,"Adam Grant does an excellent job explaining task significance.  For my graduate project, I would like to develop a program to benefit the elderly in a varity of ways.  This will, hopefully, have a positive impact on many disadvanted seniors.  To establish this ground floor business, employees will need to understand their contributions to the benefit of others (task significance) and their very unique roles in this effort.  Mr. Grant indicates that motivation (especially for less conscientous employees) can be enhanced in my project by: a)making certain all individuals connect with the elderly they are benefiting; b)finding/sharing stories with these seniors and c)creating forums to share their own stories through open conversations and providing reinforcement for this sharing.  Task significance will be included in the planning stage of this project!",5
660,The Task Significance podcast with Adam Grant brought good light on how managers should give there employees proper feedback from their jobs. It is very important to show that customers can be very appreciative towards all the little things that come with a product. The Volvo example was a great way to show why they are on top with safety precautions for the vehicles. This podcast also made me think about all my previous jobs and how I carried my behavior durring different occupations. This was a very well studied matter by Adam Grant.,4
660,"I really enjoyed the Podcast regarding ""Task Significance"" by Mark Adam.  It makes a lot of sense that in order to have motivated employees we need to show how their work makes a difference in society.  People need to know how their work benefits others.  The examples used to show how task significance has made a dramatic difference in increasing motivation among employees were extremely relevant. ",5
660,"Motivation is a key factor in the work place. People who work under a superior and see zero fruits of their labor tend to have little motivation to preform above and beyond. microsoft's surveys showed that 6 out of 10 users didn't find OS useable. The useability test lab allowed microsoft developers to first hand see what needed to be improved, why and for who. This direct motivation gave them the innitiative to make the OS more people friendly. this is task significance.",4
660,"Great podcast! I think when each employees will be motivated each organization will be benefited from that. I work in IT industry where most of the assignments are done remotely and when I feel any sort of feedback from end users, it gives me a feeling that my work is appreciated by somebody, which adds motivation to do my job even better.",4
660,"Task Significance, even though it is new term, the concept behind it is not. As long as I could remember my parents used to motivate my brothers and I to being good people. They used stories to get the point across. Example, like the boy that cried wolf, hearing that story as kids it motivated us to lie. But it is new touch using it in the business field. Is more like Personal business, because in order for task significance to work. A worker has to be personally motivated.",4
660,"I find this podcast very enlightening because it recognizes the general need for everybody to have an impact on other peoples lives through their work. I have found this to be very true in the jobs that I have worked and it also makes me consider some jobs that need a lot more feedback of their task significance. I have found some teachers and professors to be very disconnected with a large amount of their students and if they did listen to the feedback of these studnets I believe that they would be inspired to become better teachers.Recently during a workshop that I put on for accounting students I had realized my task significance when a man came up to me and told me, because my accounting workshop was so well put together, refreshing, and interactive I had inspired him to start attending our tutoring. This gave me an amazing feeling and really makes me want to better myself as a tutor so that I may make more changes of this nature to my pupils.",5
660,"I can relate to the podcast ""Task Significance: Interview with Adam Grant"" because I work at a high tech company that thrives on customer feedback to implement the next generation of processors.  I believe that feedback motivates the engineers and the company as a whole to always excel and produce a quality product for our consumers.It also translates to the individual worker.  I once told my manager that I did not see my contribution to the organization because I did not see the feedback I was used to getting.  My previous manager and peers saw that my knowledge and expertise was valuable, but I didn't feel this manager or peers was getting that.  He assured me that I was, but it made me unmotivated to do more and I became stagnant and disconnected.One of things the company tries to do is rate your work, manager, org through surveys on a quarterly basis to see your satisfaction level.  What I found out was that I was not alone in my dissatisfaction and they started to give rewards from managers and  also your peers. Every department has different customers some may be external but they can also be internal.  You could get rewards outside of your org if you help someone in a different org or worked on a project together.  It raised moral, but there was still a certain group of people that were being recognized over and over just based on monetary value.  There were people who were doing process work that reduced hours or eliminated the task altogether that were not being recognized by their managers that eventually changed.I do agree as Adam Grant stated that some of us are conscientious and have personal values, but the ones who really do well are the ones where the personal values dominate because those are the ones who love what they do at any pay and will go the extra mile.  They thrive on knowing that their small contribution helped to make a difference in another person being able to affect someone else's life or help to make a company successful in meeting their goal or mission.My company is also big on charity and volunteerism.  We as individuals and the company as a whole have donated thousands of man hours during the year and millions of dollars to crisis and charitable organizations.  To get personal thank you's from the company and the charitable organizations that what you contributed made a difference in the lives of children, families and the environment makes you want to do it over and over again.  Self-satisfaction is powerful and a great motivator.Technical Remarks:Great Site!  User Friendly and a lot of information.",4
660,"I absolutely agree with what Adam Grant has to say about Task Significance. When an employee of a company can see how his/her work is impacting other people thereby realizing the benefits they receive from it, it undoubtedly bolsters performance. It comes as a huge form of motivation as well when you see how your day to day work effects another person because you understand that you are doing your job right. Understanding one's task significance makes the employee realize his/her role in the company or organization. It acts as an agent to help the employee associate with the company better and it also ensures that they would want to work harder to have a positive impact on more people.",4
660,"i totally agree on this, i work in a field where i get to help people make their financial decisions, and i feel like i have an important say in their future. At the end of the day i get to meet people face to face and build trust so they come to me when they want a professional insight.",4
660,"Adam Grant ""Task Significance"" - having an opportunity to do work that has a positive impact on the well being of other people (social contribution)  I found Adam Grant's Task Significance, a interesting podcast to listen to. When considering the issue of work & the workplace, I agree that employees initially are productive & excited about their new job but through time, with the day-in & day-out of doing monotimous work, there is a lose of motivation, no matter how ""task significant"" their job is.  Through Grant's research with 1) Fundraiser Callers, every dollar rasied puts a person through college, scholarship students; 99% of calls get declined; quit every 2 months; by meeting 1-2 scholarship recipients, T.S. increased. 2) Life guards- read 4 articles about lifeguards saving lives; just by meeting 3-4 articles, T.S. increased. Grant was able to discover that T.S., actually increases job performance. Once an employee sees & understands their works level of T.S., they become more motivated, productive, and satisfied.",3
660,This interview made me realize my previous job's task significance which I took for granted.  If only I realized how important my job was I probably would have offered to work longer hours.  This approach to management seems to be very effective in getting yourself or anyone motivated.,5
660,"I believe that task significance is not only important for the workforce but in all parts of life. As a student, I try to perform my best not to solely land a great career but to also be a role-model to my younger siblings and a shining light for my family. In all, the podcast was very informative and touched areas that most employers and employees brush off as insignificant to business prosperity.",4
660,"The podcast ""Task Significance"" by Mark Adam was interesting for me.In the last part of his speech, he explains how the strategy work differently by person and he tells us how companies should do. I really like his second choice that we can share one story. ",4
660,"The podcast reminded me of an incident that I had while working at Fedex.  A customer came into the service center late one evening, needing to send a college application overnight.  Apparently, the deadline was the following day.  Several months later, that same customer came into the center again.  He thanked us for getting his application to the college on time.  As a result, I was able to exprience task significance first hand. ",4
660,"The podcast of ""Task Significance"" by Adam Grant states that increasing task significance actually improves job performance.  His three sugestions for managers to increase task significance include: introducing employees to people who benefit from their work, encouraging employees and customers to share stories, and creating forms for employees to share their own stories.  Employees would love to see that people benefit from their work, thus, they have motivation to perform better jobs.",4
660,It is interseting and useful. I agree with Mark Adam.Task Signigicance is very important for today's work place It can imporve peopel's job performance.It makes jobs more interesting to people and poeple will enjoy more about their jobs.,5
660,"This pod cast brought about really interesting ideas. In business job setting the overall purpos can sometimes be forgotten especially because business is very much known for being a perasonal profittable profession. When the profit starts to come in slower and slower and less and less its important to remember why exactly your doing what your doing. In the example with the call center; after seeing that what they do day in and day out really does make a difference to some one else other then their pay checks, they work harder and in turn their sales increases and so does their pay.",5
660,"I've had a lot of jobs over the years, and looking back I can see a very big difference in both my attitude and work ethic when I worked at a place which gave me low task significance. I feel like work ethic and motivation are directly related to how we see our jobs and our roles in a company. Positive reinforcement is always a great motivator, but for employers who can't always reward an employee there is task significance. Its always nice to know that the effort we put into a job is not for nothing. While many employees may start a job with high levels of motivation and a good work ethic, sometimes they can start to stray from where they first began. Becoming disconnected and losing sight of your goal is often what can lead to a slump, having constant reminders of why we so what we do is a great way to continue to reinforce our values and beliefs.",4
660,"I absolutely believe that task significance is a vital tool that more companies and employers need to take advantage of. People can often lose sight of their purpose at work when they start to forget about the impact they have on other people. Everyone wants to feel important and like they are making a difference, so it is a great motivator and reminder of why we chose that job in the first place. Firefighters for example are always in direct contact with those they are helping and are given the strength and bravery to continue to risk their lives to save others. Task significance can give an employee what they need to do anything from work harder to risking their lives on the job.",4
660,"The interview on Task Significance by Adam Grant is really good to know. Adam pointed great example about positive reinforcement to helps employees, and to see the work they do helps the company overall. Adam Grant also shown the sense of accomplishment and aligning it with the company to plan more often than not will help tremendously in the long run.",5
660,"This is a very helpful imformation and example to me. After listen ""Interview with Adam Grant"" I felt it is very important to share imformation with people related to your work. Two examples talked about in the audio are life gard and Travel company. From the example Adam is really get important imformations and life examples to help him and his cowork to improve their job qualiteis.",4
660,"""Task Significance"" ßy Adam Grants....I personally love these kinda of motivational information.  Task Significance can be related and connect to many events in others lives. Even if people do not meet who their helping, I'm sure the people getting helped appreciate the helper. Also, if someone wanted to gather stories to share, there is no need to go on a specific forum to find them. You can get positive and thrilling stories from anyone. People in general will always have some kind of interesting story to tell about themselves or about somebody they know. Just learn to ask =P Technical Remarks:Took awhile to find the button to write comments. At first I wasn't sure if it was the correct button. The sites theme is too small and cluttered if ya ask me. You should think about not style first but readability, then maybe style later on otherwise you'll lose traffic....",5
660,"The podcast ""Task Significance"" is intrestng and useful for me. It tells us how task dignificance works for people in the work. Through the task significance, co-workers can benefits each other; this aspect reminds me about team-work. Though this podcast may not talk about team-work, it tells me that we can benefit from the task significance because of the improvement on team-work. In a word, task significance is very important and useful.",4
660,"""Task Significance:Interview with Adam Grant"" After i listened this interview,the difinition of task significance leave me an impression. He said that when people do a job that could give sombady profit, we could say that its task significance.Before i listened this interview, i think that the task signfinicance only means that the work is important for your job. Just like  you tried to product a stuff, if your job could increase the quality of your stuff, it is task signficance. Compared with Ada Grant's opinion, this opinion is only cared about the stuff, but the Ada Grant's opinion care more about people,in other words its people oriented.",4
660,"The podcast on Task significance was very informative not only to business managers but also to other people that are not planning to focus on this career. He gives many examples on how task significance is important in the work place, and he also explains how managers only focus on the benefits of their employees but not the benefits the employees give to others.Technical Remarks:There wasn't any technical problems but if my professor wouldn't have given us instructions on how to find the podcast and tell us where the comment link was located it would have taken me so much time on finding the podcast.",4
660,"I really enjoyed the podcast on task significance. It gives a valuable understanding on how to make everyone involved with the company a lot more satisfied with their role. Not only will the workers be happy and productive, this will result in an overall satisfaction with the customers or target audience. It is easy to just throw money and benefits, but the feeling of a greater good is often over looked and should be focused on much more because there are a lot of people who do certain jobs for the money but aren't happy. The way the view was presented, it seems this would be much more beneficial than other incentives.",5
660," ""Task significance: Interview With Adam Grant"" leaves important messages for every person who works under workforce. Basically, he mentions about how the task significance has positively affect and educate different people whom motivate themselves in order to improve their performance or contribute their efforts in helping others or coworker etc. On the one hand, as an employer, if he/she thinks his/her job not only benefits by getting paycheck, but also benefits to other people by doing his/her responsibly, he/she will work hard and feel happy to do the job. On the other hand, task significance is look like a mirror that reflects employees' valuable contribution which encouraged them doing better from their routine jobs and give them confidence and respectability. Task significance is one of an important construction in management plan. Technical Remarks:A very clearly audio.",4
660,"From what I got out of listineng to the podcast the importance of Task significance is that it gives people motivation and the zeal of their work, according to Adam Grant's study, ""when employees are more aware of their task significance their performance increases."" However, his interventions are highly effective on subjects with ""presidential values and conscientious."" I think task significance is highly affective in almost any occupation and situation because it gives you a meaning to what you do and you become more passionate about your work instead of working only to pay the bills or because you have to.",5
660,It was interesting to hear about motivation quantitatively.  My previous manager used these sorts of techniques to bring the group to life in trying times.  It is easy to lose sight of the objectives we set for ourselves but sometimes a reminder is all we need.,4
660,"I felt that the podcast was very interesting. They could of went into more detail. However, I would suggest others to follow through their work and make sure that it is very significant. Overall, very interest but I won't listen to again. I felt that it dragged on too long.",3
660,"I think Task Significance is a very useful theory to motivate people to improve their job performences. If we can directly meet with people who are benefit from our jobs, or we can hear or see some inspiring stories that happens because of our efforts, the working efficiency will be highly increased.Truely, people tend to do the jobs that is self-interested and want to make biggest beneifts for themselves such as get more pay, promote to higher position and work less hours. However, human beings are also socialized. We require the feeling of self-satisfaction, and a feeling of being needed and demanded. If someday, some one stand in front of me and tell me that his/her life is changed because of my work, I will be proud of myself.",5
660,"Task signficance only affects certain jobs. It can only motivate certain types of people. This is why management have different managing theories for different types of jobs. The podcast is also a bit repetitive and very slow moving. The meat of the podcast could be summed up rather easily. Into a few simple points: many jobs can be improved with task signficance, task signficance can improve jobs because it motivates employees to work harder therefore turning higher earnings.",3
660,The podcast is interesting. I totally agree with Adam Grant which he mentions that task significance can motivate empolyees to work better. It is a good management method that manager can use to affect their empolyees. It gives workers a sense that they are helping people by working hardworks in a psychology way . It is a good idea that makes them to meet people they have helped. It will encourage their confidence and give them motivation to work better and more productive.,4
660,"Task significance is very interesting because it gives positive impacts on employee because it brings effective motivation and its impact on their performance. Also, it is important to know which people care about others and task significance motivate people to exercise any work with a positive action.",5
660,"I thought the video was great, it was informative and easy to understand.  I agree with what Adam has to say about Task Significance. It motivates workers to perform better on their job. Managers and employees should be more alert on having a high task significance during work because they will enjoy work more and feel satisifed helping others with their products. Therefore, task significance have a positive impact on people which is why it is highly recommended.",4
660,"The podcast on Task Significance lays out some very important details that I believe can help the management team of any department or corporation better motivate their workers.  I agree that doing anything is much more rewarding when you know exactly how it is helping people.  Feedback is a very important part of communication; when you pour all of your effort into what seems to be a blackhole and get no feedback on how your work is helping others, it becomes harder to motivate yourself to excel in your job. Seeing how one's work directly affects others makes everything more real and tangible--it allows the worker to appreciate the job and their own effort, and makes everything more worthwhile.",4
660,"I think task significance affects workers' motivation a lot. As Adam said the most important thing for management is to share the information with workers even in other department to build up the relationship. That's how managers can motivate the workers. I also like his life guard case. Life guard is a job to oversee the safety of customers, not to rescue from the emergency. So, I think management skill is also important to support the workers daily activity instead of coping with urgent problem.",5
660,The Adam Grant interview makes a lot of sense. People will take more pride in their jobs if they can actually see that it makes a difference. I think this touches on people's need to feel important and fulfilled. I also like the way that Adam researched many ways that companies use task significance to increase productivity. His evidence proves his point that people will work harder when they can actaully see the way thier efforts make a difference.,3
660,I really enjoyed listening to this podcast. Task significance is really about the employee listening to and working with the people that are using their product. It seems like the employees who do use high task significance tend to enjoy their job even more because they can see how their job is helping the people who are using their product.,4
660,Task significance gives the employee the opportunity to become involved with the product and establish a particular relationship with the user.  Motivating employees can often be tough but if you apply the concept of recognizing  their progress and seeing how their work impacts othe people by benefiting the consumer employees began to enjoy their work and stay highly motivated.Technical Remarks:a recorded video of Adam Grant would be nice.,5
660,"I enjoyed listening to this interview with Adam Grant because it shows how important task significance is. I found that having high task significance is something that managers need to be awared of because it will have an effect on both the employees and others. I like the idea of having high task significance because that would bring many positive feelings to both the employees and others. Employees will find their jobs more satisifying and meaningful, which are great gifts in return of their hard work and contributions. I personally believe that employees will be much more happier with their work, when they know that their work do make a difference in bringing positive impacts to others.",4
660,"""Task Significance: An Interview with Adam Grant""Task significance benefits and gives positive impact to other people. Jobs that make others feel happier from helping coworkers to guests. Even though these employees don’t directly interact with their guests, they are still impacting their customers greatly. I agree that it’s important for the employees to be highly motivated and be more productive to do their jobs. Higher task significance brings happier employees so that they can see that their work have high impacts.Highly enjoyed this podcast!",5
660,"While task significance is something that would be easy to measure in professions such as firefighters or Doctors, who immediatly see the effect of their efforts, it is easy to understand how, as Adam points out, employees who do not get to see proof of how their work benefits end users would lose sight of the importance of their work. The idea of implementing a sort of reward system that would in some form introduce the employees to the end user who benefits from their works is a great one, and one that would surely help stimulate productivity in people who were otherwise losing sight of its significance. ",4
660,"I think that task significance is extremely important. I think seeing and hearing how your work makes a difference in peoples lives can be very rewarding. Also like Adam Grant said about the cold callers who constantly get hung up on and yelled at, if you job doesn’t seem to make an impact, it can be very disheartening. Even though ones work might not change the world, it is still important. I believe that it is manager’s jobs to keep their employees motivated by showing them the overall picture.Technical Remarks:I am more of a visual learner rather than audio.",5
660,"The research conducted by Adam Grant's makes me realize something that I never thought of before and I agree with what this research indicates. The research is about dramatic effect of task significance on job performance which is very interesting. He talks about motivation of employees would be promoted when they have a chance to get known about how their work makes a difference in people’ life and how many benefits they offer people. The opportunity makes employees feel that they not only just do a piece of work, but also make a contribution to people",4
660,Task significance is the degree to which a job has a substantial impact on the employees or the work environment. It reveals that satisfaction ratings of the employees’ engagement are determined by perceived benefits and identification. Making a significant contribution to an organization may foster a sense of purpose and meaning. Greater perceived meaningfulness of work will be found to be associated with greater task significance.,4
660,"The podcast for Task significance was interesting to listen to. I love the idea of working of for the better of others. Helping others as you work. That was truly inspiring to listen to, and it makes you think about your working environment and behaviors. The concept is great and was explained well in the interview.Technical Remarks:It was a bit lengthy for me because I am a visual learner and an audio only podcast lost my attention here and there.",4
660,"This comment is for ""Task Singificance: An Interview with Adam Grant"".This was an interesting yet simple concept that was described.  Having worked in a marketing organization, it was interesting to see that many of the tasks we were asked to perform may not have been entirely customer focused per se.  The customer interviews may actually have been at least dual-purposed: for to increase customer satisfaction but possibly to increase employee productivity (and job satisfaction) at the same time.The interventions that were mentioned were simple yet seemingly effective methods of not only obtaining information but also providing motivation to the benefit of the customer as well as the end user, in the long run (better engineered products, more user friendly user experiences, etc).The notion of task significance seems to be a more narrowly focused relative of social responsibility.  Task significance is the positive impact on the well-being of others or that benefits others.Social responsibility is trying to ensure that what is done benefits more than just the doer.  As a previous member of the hi tech sector, it was very easy to become lost in the shuffle of the hordes of workers in the Silicon Valley chasing the almighty dollar.  WIthout task significance, employees are simply sheep following the one in front of them.I can understand how those that work in the jobs/industries that are less than desirable can feel invisible quite easily.  In fact, even in the most seemingly glamorous careers, unless the task significance is made evident, burnout is inevitable.It was indeed gratifying to meet with my customers, partners and colleagues not only to swap war stories but to share best practices.  The sense of gratification of a job well-done (from the eyes of the end user) was indeed priceless.The only other thing that I found surprising was how young Mr. Grant looks in his photo!Technical Remarks:There was a word that I couldnt quite understand. When talking about 2 types of personalities that would benefit from interventions metioned, conscienciousness and ____ processural (sp?) values.  Not exactly sure what that word was.",4
660,"That is interesting. For Task Significance I would say that high level of motivation. Organization usual motivate employee by fulfilling their need in different category including physiological need, safety and security needs, affiliation needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs.Task significance seem can not fit in any category above; however, it works as good as any category above in totally different way. The usual needs only involve employer and employer. In term of task significance, that get the three party involved such as your client, your customer... In result, it benefit all the party involving. No matter of you are a employer or employee, you should take a moment to listen to this podcast.",4
660,"After listening to this podcast, I found it to be very true, and interesting. I completely agree that when people in the work place are aware of the help they are contributing, it causes them to perform better. It makes them want to help more people. Subconsciously I knew that task significance existed, but after hearing him speak more about it, I came to realize how much it really can affect the average person. I was especially interested in the examples that he gave on medial researchers. How much time and effort they put into medicine and finding cures. They never get to meet the lives they are saving. I really appreciate the research Adam has done because I really think he was successful in it. As far as the workers meeting the people they are helping, I think that it is quite a stretch, but it is possible and he was able to do it with some already.",4
660,"This podcast really inspired me. It was so interesting. The Task Significance have positive impact on people. It not only let managers satisfied with workers but also make them more productive!! As we see in the podcast, the bottom line for manager is that they should try give job benefit to others which looks reasonable. The Task Significance refers to provide an opportunity to people and let them to make difference. This sounds good. This is an useful method for managers.At least, i learned a lot from this podcast. Highly recommended..",4
660,"I think it is very hard to get a chance to meet the people you have changed the life of. Such as Auto mechanics, how do they even get to know the people? They're so busy most of the time, they wont have time to know the customers. Also, it is not often that the mechanics see the same customers all the time. 

I believe task significance relates more to restaurants and hospitality related jobs. But more of office jobs like the callers who call to fund raise money for scholars, is where task significance lacks.",3
660,Based on Mr. Grants interview I realized that task significance is actually really important. Most times people don't see the customers buying or using the product that a person could have helped make or produce. It is great so see that Mr. Grant has given kids the opportunity to meet with the successor that have donated to give the kids scholarship. It gives the kids the chance to thank the person without needing to write a letter and it also gives the other person a chance to meet the individual that he is helping out.,5
660,I believe everything that Adam Grant's research suggests. His talk about the dramatic effect of task significance on job performance is really interesting and shows that even being a telephone solicitor can be beneficial. Showing those doing the tasks at hand what the benefit to the recipients is pure genius. I also believe that motivation keeps the job interesting and prevents it from boring repetition.,4
660,"I am working in the airline industry, which is an Asian carrier.  Our office has received a grade A+ report today for the best performance in the first half of the year.  We have 11 sales offices in the United States and San Francisco has the best grade.  For our office receiving such a high evaluation, task significance does definitely increase job performance.  We only have 5 people in the office and we all have a very good relationship.  We help each other all the times, share the work and no complaints.  Our goal is to reach our targeted quota every quarter and has the work done.  However, I want to point out that task significance may work better within a department or a division.  It's easier to control with less people.",4
660,"I really enjoyed the podcast on this task and I believe that material presented was pretty informative. The pocast is beneficial ot the workplace and the material was really easy to follow. Also, The interviewer's voice is clear and fluently. Talk a lot of details to make people understand well. I would recomend this website to other students who have relevant class work.Technical Remarks:I experienced no technical problems while using the site. The podcast uploaded immediately and played with ease. The audio is good and clear enough.",5
660,"I though that the material presented was extremely informative.  I had never heard of ""task significance"" until listening to this podcast and I now feel like I have a great grasp on what it is and why it is beneficial to the workplace. The examples used were interesting and the speaker gave a perfect amount of information. This material directly relates to the class (MGMT 405) and definitely enhanced my learning experience. I would enjoy and benefit from more podcasts from this site.Technical Remarks:I experienced no technical problems while using the site. The podcast uploaded immediately and played with ease.",4
660,"According to Adam Grant, the workers often fail to live up to their potential because they’ve lost track of the significance and meaningfulness of their own jobs. He figured that if he could remind employees of why their jobs are important, they might become more highly motivated, and therefore, more productive individuals. I think it is very important in today business world that leaders and managers can keep its employees motivated and more involved with their day to day operation.Technical Remarks:The audio presentation was really good, no difficulty at all in listening.",5
660,The podcast with Adam Grant was done very well. It was easy to follow and understand. I have worked at a few jobs where I have been able to see the benefits of task significance.  I have worked for a couple of non-profit organizations doing direct service work and task significance was one of those things that was highly recognized and valued.Technical Remarks:There were no technical difficulties,5
660,"This podcast was really insightful and brought up a lot of the concepts that I've often wondered about in my internships and part time jobs.  Believing that the work you do, as mundane as it may seem, has an impact to society or even to individuals boosts one's morale and dedication in the work they do.  But not receiving any recognition or feedback from their work is quite demoralizing and can outweigh the amount of good that exists.",5
660,"The audio of Task significance is great, very informative and clear. The reporter's questions are helpful, very professional. The interviewer's voice is clear and fluently. Talk a lot of details to make people understand well. I totally agree his points, a person's job affets other people. The point makes me have more motivation on my job even the part-time one.Technical Remarks:I think the audio is good and clear enough!",5
660,"By listening to the Podcast “Task Significance with Adam Grant,” I understood that when employees had knowledge of “Task Significance”, they created more productivities and jobs efficiency. Their motivation may get higher when they get know more about how important their work was or how much benefit they made for people. It seemed that people might discover their goal and have more willing power with their job as if they feel that they are helping people while they work. It was really great to listen to this Podcast.Technical Remarks:A comment for Under New Management",5
660,"I completely agree with what Adam has to say about Task Signifigance.  When you know how important your job is and how it affects others directly, it will encourage one to work harder and become more motivated.  I think his research paper is extremeley interesting and it really pushes the important factors that will make our lives and jobs more interesting and fun.  I too was a lifeguard for 3 years and also found my job tedious and extremely boring.  If I had read those stories, it would have helped my shifts go by much quicker and more alert.  I fuly agree with his thoughts on task signifigance.",4
660,I really enjoyed this podcast on task significance. The one on one interview really kept me interested throughout. The material was really easy to follow and searching formdifferent podcasts was very easy. I would really reccomend this website to other students who have relevant class work.Technical Remarks:I would really like to see a video instead of just staring onto a blank screen because it can get a little boring. I am more ofma visual person and to others like me a video wod really enhance my learning. The layout of the website was very user friendly and it was very easy to use and find all the different podcasts. The technical layout was remarkable.,4
660,"Mark Adam clearly introduces and explains the importance of task significance. If employees have high task significance, they are willing to help others,tend to be more productive, more satisfied and motivated with their jobs.They have positive impact on others.",4
660,"I totally agree with this author, have had a similar experience. Motivation, positive feedback definitely increases the way you work. I worked at a place where you would do something and there was no point to it. I felt not necessarily worthless, but close to it....there was no purpose. You need purpose in a workplace to help you do better with you job.",5
660,"This material was very helpful because the author clearly illustrates the relationship between task significance and motivation by using tangible examples. I agree with the author that if you get to meet people who benefit from your work,your performance will increase and you will feel more motivated.Technical Remarks:Was easy to use, although I had to scroll down to look for the task significance podcast as the list of podcast is not alphabetical.",5
660,"I must admit, this is the first time that I have ever heard of ""Task Significance.""  But, after listening to this podcast, I find Adam Grant's research and findings on the concept extremely understandable and relatable.  The more and more that I think about it, our work and the way it benefits other individuals really does have a significant impact on our own job performance and satisfaction.  Sure, while there may be other ways to achieve this like offering high salaries and/or lavish benefits and perks, at the end of the day, I believe that task significance is what’s really going to motivate employees.  To me, it’s incredibly fascinating to see how a concept as simple yet revolutionary as this could change the entire workforce’s perspective for the better.  I truly recommend others to take a listen to this podcast; while it’s 17 minutes, you won’t regret it.",5
660,"The research Adam Grant provides on task significance is incredibly eye-opening.  The fact that these workers, especially the fundraising callers, were able to increase their performance so much by simply having some interaction with those affected by their work provides a key to increased and sustained motivation.",5
660,"I strongly recommend this podcast. Mark Adam clearly introduces and explains the importance of task significance. I can connect myself with the relationship between task significance and motivation. Personally, I will certainly lose motivation on a job/project without seeing the outcomes, which is pretty similar to losing will to study for an exam when you don't find out how well you score. The satisfaction of completing a task is significant to the motivation to complete a task.",4
660,"I enjoyed learning term for the attribute of a job which the grants most employees more job satisfaction: Task Significance.  This makes sense from my communications training vantage point.  Take for example this parallel: when the source of a message is delivering that message to a recipient, they are simultaneously scanning the recipient for cues that signify they are receiving the message: feedback.  If a worker is performing work, without receiving feedback from the people they affect (customers, team mates, the organization as a whole, etc.) they are being robbed of the confirmation of a job-well-done; they are essentially working in a vacuum.  Most would argue that one would gain little job satisfaction if they did not receive feedback telling them they are making a difference.  There was a magazine article I read somewhere about an experiment conducted where workers were given forms to fill out and deliver to a person playing the role of their superior.  Upon receiving the forms, the superior nodded affirmatively, did nothing, or shredded the form in plain sight of the worker.  This reminds me of a basic experiment in Task Significance.  The first population of workers during the experiment would be expected to gain more job satisfaction than the other two groups, and so it was.",5
660,I recommend this podcast where the host interviews Adam Grant. How he connected task significance with being a swimming pool lifeguard  was pretty funny. He explains why task significance is essential to connecting employees with the the people who use their work.,4
660,"After listening to the podcast on Task Significance on Job performance it helped me to better understand how motivation is the driving force when working. Being given the opportunity to do work that creates a positive impact on others helps to produce a satisfied and meaningful working experience. It is important for these workers to see the benefit and happiness that comes from their hard work, because this promotes better performance. If an individual does not see/hear about the effects of their work they may begin to lose the motivation and lack the discipline to want to make a difference. When we see that the work we create helps someone else, it makes us strive to continue to do better.",4
660,"The podcast on the "" Task Significance"" was very interesting and had a lot of great information in it. I agree that it's very important for all workers to know that their work does make a difference and that it does matter. I think that all management should highlight to their employees how their work is going to benefit others because that will motivate workers. The examples that Adam Grant introduced were very helpful and proved that highlighting task significance does make a difference.",5
660,the advice given on this podcast is very interesting. i agree that when an employee sees how big of an impact he/she has from doing thier jobs they will work harder. i will take this advice and apply it to any future management decisions that relate to task significance.,4
660,"Great material from the research conducted by Adam Grant.  Many times as managers we may not be aware of these ""minor"" factors that do make a big difference for the organization.  The audio gave me a new perspective towards motivating employees and being aware of the task difference.Technical Remarks:Somewhat low audio/volume recording.",5
660,"This is a great interview and something all of us need to be reminded of every once in a while. Usually at the start of our new careers, we are extremely motivated to get the job done in hope of making others proud. But as the stressors compound through the months/years, we forget what it is we are actually there to do and instead, focus on the daily grind of getting through the day. If we are not in direct contact with those whose lives we affect it is very tough to feel accomplished or even happy about the work we do. Thank you for reminding me who it is I really work for.",5
660,"This is a great insight in the value of one's job.  If one does not feel like they are making an impact in the job they are doing, that could make one have no goal in their career and not work as hard.  Sometimes a simple ""thank you"" goes a long way because it's great to feel appreciated.",4
660,"Any company working task force is like a pyramid.  The higher position you are in, the more people you need to help you out.  At the base of the pyramid are the workers/laborers.  Then in the middle, you have the supervisors and managers.  Even managers have different ranks (e.g. shop managers, district managers).  Then at the very top, you the CEO.  The person who makes important decisions for the company base on the result and data given by the people below him.  As you can see, it is everybody's responsibility to look over the people below them.  Because the results they receive, are crucial information for the next rank up.  In order to have a successful company, the company have to be well organize and discipline.",5
660,"I think that if all organizations have adopted the task significant, especially with those staff who do not have direct interaction with customers, the results will be amazing.Technical Remarks:It was easy to use the material.",4
660,The idea of task signifigance is close to home for me. I am a mentor for a community college outreach program. Since I meet with my students on a weekly basis I dont experience the diminishing effect that was described. The contact I have in the mentoring that I do provided a connection to my efforts and impact I have in activity that benefits people.Technical Remarks:The site is fairly user friendly,4
660,"I just finished listening to Adam Grant's podcast on ""Task Significance."" I thought within the short interview time, the importance of task significance was explained creatively and very thoroughly. I reflected on my own personal job experience, and how my managers always influence me to do more than expected without actually telling me that. I know that the tasks that I carry out on a daily basis are important because of the type of reports I am creating and sending out. Based on the management that I send my finished work to, I know that the information I provide is going to benefit overall to help upper management make important decisions. I know that if I were a manager, I would definitely encourage my staff to see how their work impacts others, and how important the tasks they accomplish are. For example, Adam Grant mentioned Medtronic, and how they brought engineers into hospitals to see what their work actually does for patients. I currently work in a hospital, and in one department I used to work in, we had Medtronic employees come in weekly for medtronic device-specific patient cases to see what their equipment is used for and how it can be improved. I completely agree with Adam grant about connecting those two lines of communication and work together to produce a highter outcome of work productivity. I believe that once someone knows why their jobs and tasks are important, they will strive to achieve higher results. Because of that type of theory at my own job, I know that I aim to achieve more than what is asked of me.",4
660,"Working in retail takes a toll on a person when customers are constantly nagging at the cashier over everything.  I am usually that cashier that gets yelled at when a product is not on the shelf, or when there is a wrong sales tag on an item.  For this reason, the working conditions had made me lack in my work efforts because I feel that customers will always have something to complain about.  In response to customer attitudes, Adam Grant’s “task significance” may be the balance of power that employees or the foot soldiers of these retail chains need to better view customer complaints.  In illustration, if regular employees were given the simple sense of importance, there would simply be an immediate result of these acknowledgements.",4
660,"I listened to Adam Grant's Podcast on task significance. I really enjoyed the idea and have found that what he said is totally applicable. it is so personally rewarding for some one to see how their work can affect some one else. When you have lots of people depending on your work, you try to do  a little better. I work at a coffee shop and find it rewarding providing my customers with the best drinks i can make. i want everyone to enjoy what i am doing and want me work ethic to come through in the quality of my goods. I have a lot of customers who are responsive to me work and it makes me want to keep it up. When it comes time for a bi annual review, I know I will do well because other people tell me. The task  significane in me work make me want to try extra hard even though i am just making lattes..Technical Remarks:fast loading. good sound quality",5
660,"A significant point that Adam Grant explains is how powerful if people realize tasks that they've performed that positively benefit and  impact others although they may not directly communicate customers or consumers. Also Adam gives his live experiences that explain more how task significance positive affects motivation and productivity. I believe it is good to know how important for each one to realize his or her job that greatly impacts others within the organization although it is a very minor task. It will educate people, build relationship or make others feel good.Technical Remarks:capable for MP3, easy download, and content is useful",4
660,"I found out that the term ""task significance"" is important for both the worker and the end-user. For example, a person who is developing the brakes for my car may feel bored if he does the same job everyday without seeing the results. He may not see his result and he will be tired of his job because he usually does not communicate with customers or receive feedback. However, if he can get some feedback or recognition from customers or users, he can feel that his job is helping people, and he is satisfied with his job. It leads to increase both his motivation and performance. Thus, I think task significance is really important.",5
660,"I think Task Significance introduced by Adam Grant is a great way to motivate employees and increase their effectiveness. We have probably all been in a situation at work when it seems like nobody cares about the results of our work. A friend of mine used to be in a military; he was wearing a uniform in a regular fast food restaurant when a stranger approached him and thanked him for the service to the country. My friend was very touched, as it helped him to realize that his job matters to others. Therefore, I think managers should utilize Task Significance technique.",5
660,"The podcast was very informative and eye-opening.  It provided me various ways in which I can engage my employees and motivate them to do better each and every day.  I am in healthcare and the need to  motivate staff through task significance will be very helpful.  After all we are in possibly the most important business that exists ,providing a clean and healthy, soothing environment in which patients can heal and feel better.",4
660,"Adam Grant interview on Task Significance- Interesting topic. I have always said that no matter what I do I would hope to make a difference in what I'm doing. Many people get up every day and go to work and do something that doesn't really make a real difference in the world. I hope that i am able to acheive that in my future career. Anyway, I also find it interesting that people that do have jobs that are of great significance and really make a difference can get to the point to where they are so disconnected that they lose their motivation. Medical researchers...journalists...authors...all good examples.",3
660,"I listened a interview about ""task significance"" by Mark Adam today.  He claims that Task Significant is an opportunity to bring positive impact of well being to other people.  It makes an individual feel good about what he is doing, and willing to make contributions.  Task Significant helps build relationship among customers, co-workers, supervisors in many ways.  It gives motivation to employees to better performance when the employee realized themselves can help others.  I like the example Adam provided in the interview, an university call center who raise fund for scholarship.  The callers have an important mission and they can help lots of people.  But before they realized their importance, the callers quit every 2 months because their pressure when people rejected their calls.  But after they have direct contact with the students who benefit from the fund they raised.  They become more motivated and more productive.",5
660,"This information is very interesting and very useful to know about. I would have never know about task significance if I have not listen to this podcast. What Adam Grant points out in this is very useful for everybody. The place I work, a lot of workers are like that too. We lose motivation because a lot of us have been there doing the same thing for such a long time.  I want my manager to know about this task significance too because it is important to keep the workers motivated so they can perform better at work.",4
660,I found the podcast very interesting when Adam explained how task significance can improve an employee and make more efficient at their job. By letting the employee meet the customer that has been saved or uses the product helps them everyday life. Knowing that a person can go to their job and feel happier by his/her work efforts that will affect other people lives. Also the employees can relate to the saved lives from their related work field and that reinforces the employee of what their capable of saving peoples live or making life easier. This is what I found interesting about the pod cast.,5
660,"its good, it has some good points especially about the study on motivation and task significance. I liked how people got to meet others they are helping! It is great to feel and touch something you changed. Also, the second study seems very interesting,in terms of how your view on your work can change by showing them how it can be very important and crucial to others at times.",4
660,"I think that the podcast on task significance with Adam Grant was very intresting since i haven't hear about this term before. And this is important at today's workplace for job higher performance. This is not only important for Organization, but also for individual worker to get a sign of positive perspective, and motivation. I think if people can have a chance to do jobs that they intrested in, they are more motive and feel passion about the job, and even feel positive about themself.",5
660,"I had never heard the term task significance before this podcast, but I think that it is an interesting concept.  I found the studies that Adam Grant conducted to be very interesting and informative about the importance of task significance.  I think the correlation between task significance and overall employee performance is something that managers should focus on.  I agree that if people in general can see a benefit in the tasks that they perform, then they are more likely to perform them well.  Providing employees with a chance to see the benefit of their work is a good way to increase productivity and happiness.  As Adam explained, he found that most employees want to help people in one way or another so allowing employees the chance to witness their task significance is a step in increasing productivity.  Overall I found this podcast to be very informative on the subject of task significance and would recommend it.",5
660,"I thought this was a really interesting podcast, I agree with everything Adam Grant had to say. If people realize the importance of task significance, employees will be much more motivated to do well and perform better at work, which helps to benefit others as well as themselves. It also helps people become more reliable and dependable, and the turnover rate becomes much smaller. There are a lot of simple ways to show employees the importance of task significance of their work: connecting the employees with the people who benefit from their work, simply sharing stories of the impact of their work, and creating forums for employees to talk about the importance of task significance. A lot of people become unmotivated in their jobs simply due to self interests and repetition of the same tasks everyday, but I believe that if they are able to realize that their work benefits others, they become much more in tune and motivated to perform well.",5
660,I like this podcast because it is very helpful to know how task significance is important in  workplace. I totally agree with their ideas. Task significance is especially important for individual culture to care of and help co workers because it motivates them and increase productivity. It also would be benefical for companies result of it to develop their own companies.,5
660,"This was a great podcast on task significance. While I am at work, I often lose hind sight of the tasks I'm supposed to be doing at work. I guess it comes down to motivation. As long as you stay motivated, you can keep up with your tasks and also know the significance of your work.",5
660,"I agree completely with Adam Grant on how employees if they are more informed or recognize task significance it is beneficial for them, costumer and company as they are motivated and work harder. Also, how it plays an important role in the performance of employees and the company they serve.",4
660,"I think that the podcast on task significance with Adam Grant was very informing. I agree with his insight on how employees tend to lack task significance in their workforce.  I think task significance is important in order for employees to enjoy their job and be motivated. This video has made me think about my own task significance in my workplace.  I believe that managers do try to make their employees more motivated to work and enjoy their jobs, but in the end, there are times when it doesn't work as they would like.",4
660,"Employees recognizing their task significance is very beneficial to a company and the consumers. Task significance motivates the employee to work harder and pay more attention to detail, knowing that it will be extremely important to the consumer and can even be life saving. An example of this is auto technicians fixing a car's brakes. The driver of the car might be thinking he or she is only getting the brakes fixed to get rid of the squealing noise, however the technician knows that bad brakes can cause an accident. If the driver met with the technician and was fully explained the importance of fixing the brakes the driver will probably be more thankful thus increasing the technicians motivation and attention to detail the next time he works on a car. 

Another good way for workers to realize their task significance is to put up stories around the work place; showcasing the effect of the employees work. This would be a good way to read what their work does for consumers; how it helps them.",4
660,High task significance on job performance is extremely important because it motivates the workers to do more knowing that they can see that it is positively affecting others and making a difference. Instead of performing monotonous tasks it is more important and has higher effects on people’s jobs when they have face to face contact and as a result they feel that their work is actually making a difference and having a positive impact on other people.,5
660,I was very interested in the topic of high task signifigance. I agree that there are many jobs that deal with the benefits of others and also customers and the employers often lose sight of the significance because they dont get to see the other side of the results. Sadly its seems to be a common theme in the workforce today.,5
660,Task significance adds a higher degree of connection to your work and also contributes motivation. In turn the likely hood the goods or service will provide more quality for the work put in. I find that companies that rely heavily on the quality of their products should implement this aspect to their workers. Years of bureaucratic structures have built this way of business but now innovative companies such as google who implement this type of workplace is hailed and copied in this new century.,4
660,"I believe this is a interesting topic, and its important because it helps motivate people and make employees realize how important their job is and how it help others. 

I also believe some companies should use this techniques as Volvo for example who passed comments from one department to another.  Or as the other life guards who work extra 3 hours for the following 6 months. 

finally i believe motivate employee it helps your company reducing the amount of employees quiting and happier employees.",4
660,"I found this Podcast to be very helpful in regards to connecting classroom material to the real world. The audio did not take much time to start and was very clear. Listening to this Podcast, I learned the importance of keeping workers in contact with the everyday people they impact. I was amazed at how much this increases employee motivation. Letting employees know that they make a difference gives them the motivation to perform their jobs even better. Task significance is essential because it helps prevent employees from quitting their jobs as mentioned in Adam Grant's study. The interview was very informative and had interesting points. Overall, I found this Podcast to be very insightful.Technical Remarks:Only minor problem. The Podcast froze a couple of seconds in the middle of the recording.",4
660,"Task significant:
it means a piece of work is  important to other people, either inside or outside the organization.  Employee will be more productive if they know the work they are doing right now is important or it brings benefit to others.

Adam Grant did 2 groups of experiences.  One of the experience is that employee from university fund calling centre meet scholarship students, thus they know the work they are doing now does matter to other people.  Not surprisingly, they are more productive and raise more funds.",3
660,"I think Adam Grant is wonderful explaing Task significance and how doing your job correctly can benefit everyone elese. I think all jobs are tast significance, especially if your an ethical employee, you can help , not just yourself and other people, but the entire stakeholders",5
660,"In general, task significance is defined as extend to which an identifiable piece of work affects others. An employee's knowledge of other people's dependence on his/her work is an important factor in his/her work satisfaction. Particularly, the importance of acknowledging task significance is to help employees boost motivation and morale. Adam Grant's conversation about the task significance demonstrates its importance. 
    First, job satisfaction raises employee's motivation and morale. One of task significance is the job satisfaction that is contentment arising out of interplay of employee's positive feelings toward the work. For instance, Adam Grant tells about a story that the auto workers bring joy to the drives and passengers by producing vehicles for their use. Because of the robotic procedures, the auto workers perform the same job again and again, resulting that they feel bored and lack of motivation. As long as the users of the vehicles share happiness with the workers who make those vehicles, the worker's motivation is raised. Therefore, the workers are motivated by job satisfaction.    
    Lastly, recognizing task significance is also help employees boost motivation and morale. For instance, Adam Grant tells an example about the duty of a lifeguard. Even thought there are few people drowning while they swim in a swimming pool, the duty of the lifeguard is important. The lifeguard's duty to watching people swimming can be boring. Keeping the lifeguard to stay alert and motivated through the duty time becomes problematic. Letting the lifeguard understand the importance of the task significance becomes priority, a managerial goal. Sharing comments and appreciations making by the swimmers with the lifeguard is one of the best ways to reach the goal. Therefore, recognizing the task significance is important. 
    In conclusion, the importance of acknowledging task significance is to help employees boost motivation and morale. The task significance brings people in distance to a relationship. The job done by the task performers is greatly recognized by the task users.",3
660,This is a very interesting podcast for me because it is the first time that I heard about the subject of task significance.  I enjoy listening to this podcast and everything that Adam Grant said was very interesting to me.  I like how Adam Grant gave examples to show how task significance can change job satisfaction and performances.,4
660,Adam Grant is interesting to listen to.  I like his thoughts on invisble task significance.  It makes sense that those jobs need a higher degree of motivation.  His life guard story was entertaining and tied in great with his whole task significance and motivation points.  Managers need to motivate their employees and make them feel like they have an important impact that benefits other people.,4
660,Task significanc is an essential element for managers to consider in order to motivate and encourage employees.obviously people work better if they recognized and appraised in some way such a as treated and paid well. Task significance is importat aspect of carrer stisfaction and workers start realizing that they work and produce a high benefit to others.,5
660,The podcast was logical.  It some industries and companies employees are more and more disconnected from the end user or customer as everything gets more specialized. I think its a good reminder for all companies to remind and show their employees why they do what they do and how their work as contributed.,4
660,"Very interesting video! It raised an important point about today's employees in the workplace.  Employees should recognize that the work they put in does make a difference and benefits their organization in small, yet good ways.  Management needs to be more aware of a lack of task significance in their employees in order to increase motivation in the workplace.",4
660,"This podcast was a very interesting to me, and I did learn a lesson from this.  When people giving the good feedback to the employees on what they do, they will be more motivated.  Also a true story can change the people’s attitude on working. . Overall, I like it.",4
660,"Wow! This podcast was great! It really brings up a great point. Task significance is really important. People nowadays really lose sight how one's work can lose it's meaning. Work matters! The purpose behind whatever work you may be doing it does have an significance. It is completely true that people become disconnected to their work all the time. Especially if it's not hands and not interactive. If people actually see the work they do effects the people who use it, it will motivate them to work even harder and enjoy what they do. I work in a hotel and I don't think I ever disconnect to what I do. When I help a guest I see the result of my work. I get good feedback from the guest. Therefore for me, I never lose sight of task significance. Adam's examples were great and it made a lot of sense. Managers do need to keep motivate us the employee and to highlight how the job is going to benefit others.",4
660,"Jobs create opportunity to make a difference,and help others to do good.People help co-worker, supervisior, customer, client in their jobs. Authors, journalists, drivers, engineer, and scientist are also helping everyone behind the scene.",3
660,"I think that the podcast explained an important issue that many individuals face in the workplace. As individuals it is easy to become disconnected from what our jobs do for other people and I think that seeing the connection that what employees do matters to consumers, and not just to make a profit. It is important to see results of your labor.",4
660,"Task significance would be beneficial for any management position. This was a very informative podcast that could make dramatic differences in any working environment. Adam Grant thoroughly explained the definition of task significance, examples of work which displays direct task significance, examples of work which disconnects direct task significance, why task significance is important and how to make the connection of task significance with all forms of work. I appreciate how he states the obvious, that employers assume that employees only interest in a position is the pay, benefits and other intrisic motivational factors. Yet, just equally important is task significance for all employeses. His examples of how the callers raising money towards scholarships changed after being directly introduced to task significance, those students who actually benefited from those calls, was amazing!!",5
660,"Task Significance - This was a very interesting subject he discusses.   I feel like what he said about having significant tasks for your employees to do is so crucial for sustainability. People get caught up in the day to day routine that sometime we lose sight of what’s important.  If employees don't know how they are making a difference, they can get very lost in the task and not realize the difference they are making. Motivation decreases when the task does not seem significant.  

His two examples where great in demonstrating how one can make a task significant if one approach the situation a particular way.  In both examples, the performance increased greatly once employee understood and were about to see the difference they made.  Interacting with the people that are benefiting from your service makes things real and personal – and of course, significant.",4
660,This is a very useful topic to know. It apparently seems as though some people don't know that task significance is very important. It helps others motivate each other to improve their work environment and performance. Although this only works for the people who love their job because they know that they're committed to staying for more than they have to.Technical Remarks:Had a hard time hearing a few words.,4
660,Great podcast. Interesting topic and Very valuable information. Adam Grant addresses an issue that I believe every business must do at some point or another. He then provides a solution to this issue in clear and easy to understand way with the use of real life examples. Before listening to this podcast I was not aware of the importance of task significance in the work place. Now I understand how important it is and how to apply its principles.Technical Remarks:easy to access and play podcast,5
660,"I found the podcast interesting, informative, and inspiring. Now when I go to work, I won't just think of it as 'work', but going to a job that has 'task significance.",4
660,I found this Podcast interesting because I didn't really understand or hear first hand about what task-significance is. I am the kind of person who is interested in jobs that really aid and help others. When I know I will benefit others I feel more drawn towards my work and want to impress those I am helping. So I agree with the theory that task-significance improves performance as long as the people are motivated to help. How could something as valuable as saving someone's life not be motivating?Technical Remarks:Volume could be boosted just a little more.,4
660,Task significance is very important to any organization. It helps employees know what their value are in the company. It is easy to for employees who have been in a company too long doing the same job over and over again and not knowing that the job they are doing is benefitting someone. Everyone's duties are as important to the higher management down to the very bottom of the pyramid of the company.,4
660,"How is this not obvious? Of course people who work at call centers won't be working there their whole life, let alone longer than two months. Who wants to work at a retail store longer than they have to? Higher task significance is obviously directly related to loving your job and keeping it longer than two months. You have to love you do, else it's just considered ""work"".",2
660,"I'll be honest, I've never heard of ""Task Significance"" until this podcast and from the class.  It was very interesting the way how Adam Grant described how it directly relates to the motivation of an individual.  He used various examples to help explain ""Task Significance"" to the audience.  Examples like, Volvo cars, student call centers, Microsoft engineers, and Metronic Medical Supplies.

What Adam stated on the podcast should be implemented in today's working environment.  Alot of organization's managers today are leading by fear.  Fear as in informing the employee that their jobs may be in jeopardy due to low performance.  As stated by Adam, instead of leading by fear, lead by giving the employee ""high"" Task Significance.  This will motivate the employee to succeed and ""enjoy"" their work and therefore the results will show positively for the organization.Technical Remarks:His example of 3 Way Organization Can Use Positive Information:
1.) Introduction to the people that it has an impact on.
2.) Stories how it helped.
3.) Create internal and/or external forums to share stories.

These are such easy procedures to implement within an organization to focus on positivity and productivity.  I truly believe organizations today do not implement procedures that reinforce the creed, ""job well done.""  Instead organizations or managers say, ""Okay, when is the next sale???  We need more production, and we need it now.  What are you doing to close your next deal?""  Unfortunately, that is Corporate America.",5
660,I thought that this podcast was extremely interesting. I believe that Adam Grant made a really good point about working in an environment that benefits others leads to employee satisfaction as well as increases motivation.,5
660,"Before this podcast, I believed that people were just doing their jobs as.. programmers, teachers, etc so that they would get paid.  After hearing this podcast, success stories really do change the way people work.  When people give employees feedback on what they do, they can see what went wrong and hopefully correct.  As for success stories, I believe that they do motivate the employee to do better.Technical Remarks:Good and clear sound quality",4
660,The fact that I never thought about task significance as an important factor for employees is shocking. I definitely understand how individuals knowing and learning that what they do is beneficial and important for others can lead to better work performance. If employers knew how to keep their employees motivated and informed of how their work may make an impact on others lives would create a positive workforce. Being more conscientious of the impact of your work can result to a more motivated company. Employees and the people they help would benefit if task significance was exercised regularly.,4
660,"I found his situations in which he conducted research very interesting. The calling bank was interesting, it showed there was proof in the amount of work that they do to make an impact. The interventions were a perfect idea, they got to meet them and talk to the students who were benefitting from their donations. 

While wanting to make a difference, he was not able to because he was not given the chance as a life guard. Realized, the situation shouldn't occur because you should have prevented the accident in the first place. By taking stories from the media, he was able to make people see they had the potential. He was very smart in all of his interventions, he was able to create a large impact on both situations. 

By making people realize they had an impact on the situations, they were able to feel better about their personal positions, and was able to see that their jobs were very worth while. By implementing these interventions, there are many other options that will help motivate more people towards higher performance. 

Many examples have spawn from information like the studies he had done. This is all good examples on how to make ann impact on the people who are not so motivated in this century, by bringing engineers into a hospital they were able to see first hand that their work was in a good situation.",3
660,"I actually enjoyed the podcast and everything that was said.  Adam Grant seems to have it all figured out.  Everything the guys said made sense and he backed it up with examples.  Seems like he has been there done that with most aspects of being a manager.  I believe Grant when he says that when an employee is aware of what/who benefits from their job...that knowledge will affect the employee in a way that nobody can.Technical Remarks:Does Task Significance increase work performance? 

Does it apply to each employee?",5
660,"I really enjoyed listening to Task Significance. I felt that Adam Grant really hit the target about how important it is to have employees' realize that what they do has an impact on the company. I know so many people, including myself, that would enjoy their job more if the new that the work they did had some type of significance on the company. If companies had their employees' realize the significance of their task they would definitely find that their employees' preform better.",5
660,"This podcast seemed very interesting to me. I believe the idea of task significance is very important for people to feel that their job is needed, which in turn will give them more motivation to do their jobs to their fullest. In the end, this works out the best for everyone. Both customers/clients and employees are happy, along with management.",4
660,"I just finished listening to the Task Significance podcast, and I found it to be very informative and interesting.  I never realized how something so simple could make such a big difference in the employee’s work life.  The employees seemed to be more motivated and seemed to work harder just by either meeting someone who's life they've changed or hearing a story of how their job makes a difference in someone's life.  It was very informative, and I feel that every company owner should take this to consideration.  They should introduce their employees to any person whose life has changed.  This way the employees can feel that their work is much more meaningful.  I really did enjoy this podcast and would recommend it for others to listen to.",4
660,I thought that the suggested interventions presented to the scholarship students were interesting and an intelligent new way for students to make money for school.,4
660,"I thoroughly enjoyed the podcast on task significance. It was surprising to me how such a simple topic could make such a difference in people's job performance. It makes perfect sense that people would be more motivated and driven if they knew that there work was benefiting someone else. I really understand this concept, because I work in an atmosphere with very low task significance. Granted, my  job is temporary and I don't plan on making a career out of it, it would still be nice to know that what I do actually benefits people. I'm glad that I was able to get a firm grip on this concept so that when I'm in a management position I will know to implement some of these techniques to help motivate my employees. Overall, great podcast. Simple, to the point, and profound.",4
660,"I am a student and am looking over some information from this site for a class. It was easy to learn the content of the material- it was only one podcast I was to listen to. I just finished listening to the podcast before I started on my comment. I found the concepts in the material that I reviewed to be fairly accurate, that I could calculate. 

 This is the first I have heard of task significance.  I found it interesting how Mr. Grant made the connection between jobs and identifying how they help society.  Also, to  use enthusiasm as a technique for better productivity, I found smart and a bit sneaky. It also seems a great technique since it wouldn't seem to cost much to do.Technical Remarks:This is my first time using merlot and it is a little confusing to me.",4
660,"I completely agree. If somebody feels as though the work that they are doing directly helps somebody or will make a difference they will work harder. At my job as a receptionist, I make appointments for people. Usually I just make them at the convenience of the office, but when a client explains that they are going out of town, or only have a babysitter on certain days, I go out of my way to find something accommodating for them, even if it may cause some inconvenience for the office and we have to stay later, if I am helping someone I am more prone to do it than if it was just a regular appointment.Technical Remarks:I only gave it 3 stars because there was no graphics, the podcast seemed I was listening to the radio, with technology today it would have been easier to pay attention if I had something I was looking at.",3
660,"I think that it would be a great idea to create a website that connects the engineers of automobile products, medical products, and etc... with the actual consumers that had been saved because of a specific product or who have come across problems that could effect other people. I liked the example with Microsoft and their developers.",4
660,The podcast was interesting because it used case study examples to show how task significance can effect job satisfaction and performance. It made me begin thinking about ways to put this theory to use in my restaurant. I am a Front of House manager. I find that the servers that try hard have really happy guests. But I think that servers that are not as focused and driven may benefit from understanding their task significance.,4
660,"I enjoyed this podcast.  Task significance seems like such a common sense thing, that people work better if they can see how their work directly benefits others, but it gets overlooked so often.  I know that is a complaint of many people that I've worked with over the years, including myself.  I currently work as an event planning assistant for a company that does mostly fundraisers, and I am fortunate enough to be able to see how the job that I do directly benefits these charities.  I do my best to try and remember that feeling of satisfaction and pride when things start to get overwhelming or problems start to arise, and it always helps.",3
660,What Adam is saying makes much sense.  An employee who feels replaceable and feels that he or she is not important is going to create a high turnover. And just showing employees the impact they make and showing them that what they do does make a difference can motivate them to work harder.,5
660,It really is a motivator to understand the task significance of ones job. One often gets caught up in the 9-5. But it does provide a little boost to your motivation if you realize your doing some good!,4
660,"The podcast was very informative and relevent.  Im a manager for a baseball team and I know it takes a while to figure out how to motivate players/employees. Its hard to get 110 percent out of all the kids and you have to try many different attempts to learn the best method. Managers need to make employees feel comfortable at work and make sure they are wanted (unless if there not wanted,haha). Try to make the job as fun as possible. I know when I teach young players, the best way to bring out their hardest efforts is to make fun out of it. They hate to run, but if you give a running incentive or makeup a conditioning game that is fun, then they will try as hard as they can.",4
660,"The information presented in the podcast was very informative.  As a manager it is always difficult to find was to motivate employees to perform at their top level.  Often times I wonder if they are the right person for the job or if they do not completely understand the mission and vision of the organization.  However, the concept of Task Significance is great.  Motivating employees by 1) Introducing employees to the people who are directly benefiting from the work.  2) Find and share stories about the impact of the work.  3) Create forums to share their own stories.  This is a great way to make the work more relevant to employees who need to connect with the work they are doing.  As a manager I need to be more intentional in building bridges between employees and the individuals in which we serve.",5
660,"I found the podcast Task Significance with Adam Grant very interesting. It is hard in some job positions to think about task significance and understand how it applies to you. For example, I was a manager at a clothing store for a while and I rarely thought about task significance. However, now that I look back I was helping people find something (clothing, accessory, etc.) that made them feel good or maybe even a little better about themselves. Maybe I helped someone pick out a dress for a high school reunion and they were able to walk into that event feeling amazing. That is a really neat thing and makes me feel like I was actually contributing something while working in retail. I have a journal that I keep good ideas for a future business in. After listening to this Podcast I wrote about task significance and the fact that I need to make my employees feel good about what they are doing and help them understand that they are contributing to society, even if it is not obvious.",4
660,"The podcast that I am commenting on was Task Significance with Adam Grant and I felt that it was very informative and easy to follow.  The fact that I took from this was that a good manager doesn't only worry about the satisfaction of the customers, but also his employees.  The best way to do this is creating Task Significance, and with this your employees will enjoy their job that much more because they realize they are truly helping people in some way every day, creating significance.  I also felt that the three examples on how to create task significance was valuable as well.  The first way was to bring in customers that your employees have helped, the second was to bring in stories of how their work is significant, and the third was to create forums where employees can share their own stories of significance.  In the end I felt this podcast was very informative for managers.",4
660,"A very simple to understand podcast on task significance, which is the first element to evaluate when you feel dissatisfied with your job. In today's fast paced work environment, people forget or don't realize the impact their work has on the others. Knowing for fact that your work has saved lives, cured disease, or provided other intangible benefits brings satisfaction to the employee and increases productivity as well. If only all corporations and its employee could realize and focus on the positive impact they have on society, ethical behavior wouldn't be a controversial issue in business.",5
660,"This podcast reflects how the workplace actually operates.  Employees get bored with their tasks which leads to less productivity and dissatisfaction.  Over time, this problem can eventually contribute to the overall turn-over rate in a company.",4
660,"I agree with the podcast.   Task Significance gives people who are disconnected with the end result of their work, something to continue to produce work above and beyond their daily tasks.  As a person who works for an IT department. See and talking with the users ( my customers) gives me a statifaction of helping people and most important, getting the ""thank you"" for helping them with something they needed. 
Neil Pedrosa ( SFSU )",4
660,"I think we should try to introduce Adam's idea to every college. I am a scholarship recepient of 09 Fall-10 Spring. And I am trying to apply scholarship for next academic year but I discovered that the number of scholarships that SFSU provides for undergraduate students have dramatically decreased. Scholarship is very important for students who come from low income family, especially during this economic down turn. By introducing Adam's method, the number of scholarship will increase and it will help a lot of student to continue their education.",5
660,"Wow, this podcast was definitely very informative and has made me aware of just how important it is to incorporate employees with the people whom they have helped. I completely agreed with the speaker when he was talking about repetitive jobs, and how workers get tiresome and bored because they work hard day-in and day-out, but don't see the results of their work. I now believe that it is very important to keep your workers in touch with the people whom they help because I can clearly see a benefit from doing so. In my personal experience with past jobs volunteering at schools and various other places, I have noticed that I too tend to be more motivated with each person I help. I tend to work harder and longer because I know that what I'm doing is making a difference in someone's life.",5
660,"This interview is interesting and useful to everyone who is working in the business. It also influences the company on their organization. Sometimes it is really hard for employees to get into the motivated situation, however, it is important. A good way to make employees interested in their work, company should show how important of them in the company. It makes them to love and interested in their work which they do.",4
660,"I thought this interview very useful to everybody ( corporations, managers, employees)because task significance is very important but a lot of employers and employees don't realized how task significance is important. In my situation I work in customer service and I like to hear that customers enjoyed the movie reviews or suggestions it keeps me motivated to watch movies so I can continue to give reviews and suggestions to other customers. The first recommendation of Adam Grant was to make connections with software developers and users is a great idea because that way there's motivation of both sides. To know that someone is using your product to the fullest is a great motivation to continue to build great products.",4
660,"It was interesting examples and features that how we can use task significant but I would say it was nothing new. For so long time, the importance of customer side has been emphasized especially with high technology product lines and services. To fulfill this idea, we need a high ethical standard which is opened to other people rather than ourselves. However I am not sure how many people can actually get motivated and how long it can be stayed. People have really diverse interests and different standards. To ask the same amount/kind of responsibilities does not really make sense for general. This idea is too ideal.Technical Remarks:don't know what does it mean by 'Problem in Database Connection' do i need to download 3 items listed below?",3
660,"It is interesting and beneficial. When people know that their jobs make changes or affect many things especially on the good side, they would work harder to achieve more. People would consider it as realzsing personal values.",3
660,The material was very interesting. The case studies that Mark Adam did regarding Task Significance emphasized how important it is for workers to know their importance to other people. I like how he also explained that people who are already conscientious are most likely not to affect the Task Significance Experiment because they already care about their job and they already know their value in their job. Interesting!,5
660,it was very ensighntful. The ideas used are extremely brilliant. Its amazing how something so simple can do so much in the business world.,5
660,"definitely recommend. this ""Task Significance"" is new to me, and i think it will work for people who use it. I think it will help employees be more productive..",4
660,"I thought this podcast was beneficial and educational and those the research and ideas very interesting. It seems like very practical but I'm sure not all managers think about these kinds of things in the workplace. People aren't going to motivate themselves all the times, it is the responsibility of the managers to keep people motivated to a certain degree.",3
660,"I felt that the podcast on task significance was very well done and easy to understand.
Even I never heard of term ""task significance"", I am pretty sure people are defintely more engaged in working when they realize that what they do is of great help to someone else out there. I would recommend this podcast to employers and employees alike - seeking for motivation within their area of work.",4
660,"Anyone with sales experience can tell you that task significance is a huge and often-overlooked factor in motivating employees.  The examples used in the podcast are relatively intuitive: safe cars and lifeguards save lives; scholarships provide life-changing experiences.  But I would bet that your average bank employee or intern doesn't see what they provide as quite so significant.  There are a great many other jobs out there (especially in marketing and finance right now) for which employees lack motivation because they are genuinely uncertain that they are providing something of value.  And where, as the speaker in the podcast mentioned, there are some employees that are naturally motivated enough perform at high levels regardless of their perception of task significance, I suspect that they are a minority in non-executive employee groups.  Greater focus on this aspect of motivation may yield surprising results.",4
660,"It true that managers are really influenced by how the company is organized and is the company is run. Making a difference in a job is something really important that an employer could do, however at many times employees are not motivated because they really dont see the difference they are making. So, it is important to show employees the work they are doing and to make them interested in the work they are doing.",4
660,"Well after listening to the podcast on Task Significance, i have to say that that was one of the better podcasts i have listened too.  

Although i wont go into the details of the podcast because it is posted on iLearn for anyone to listen to, i will say that Task Significance is easily one of the top concepts managers should get track of.  Almost every job there is in the world involves a product or a service, and behind every job or service is someone or a group of people that develop that product or service or find a way to bring it to the general public.  

Everyone in one shape or form wants to make a difference, and cares about others to a certain degree.  With that said, it is often forgotten how what you do everyday in your job, benefits others, even if the job you do contributes only a fraction of the whole.  With how fast-pasted life is now a days, people get caught in a rut if you will, and loose track of the bigger picture.  

Managers and employers try to give employees jobs that benefit themselves, give them maximum pay, try to make their work interesting, give them chances for promotion, and give them chances to learn and chances to develop, but what is equally important that Adam said was the it is equally important is that ma mangers need to highlight how each job is benefiting others.  Again, most employees want a difference, but it is particularly important to show them how thier work helps the users.  

I think Adam had some very insightful and very helpful examples of how task significance has helped companies, and more specifically how it has helped major companies that everyone would know.  I think the example of how Microsoft used their ""usability lab"" to allow developers to see first hand how users were using their software and what problems they had.  This allowed the developers to see that normal, intelligent, everyday people were having problems...thus leading them to fix the problems of their software and increase their motivation to making better software in the future.  

I also like the Volvo example with how the managers brought in people to tell the auto safety engineers how their efforts to develop the latest in safety saved their lives during crashes.  The point that Adam made about having direct contact with your users and the people that are closest to your product/service yields the greatest change in motivation, which is directly proportional to task significance.  

All in all I thought that this podcast and the research that Adam has done is extremely important.  I will undoubtedly keep this with me for the future, as it is the key to keeping a company and its employees successful.",4
660,"Task Significance"" is really new to me,i even have not heard before. but after listening to the interview by Adam Grant, I realized ""Task Significance"" is important and useful. it let me know about more between company and customer. Since the ""Task Significance"" helps the company has the better connection between employees and customers, company provided higher quality of service to the customer. ""Task Significance"" really benifits to the company.",4
660,The interview with Adam Grant was a great podcast on task significance: easy to understand and follow.  The concept of having an opportunity to have a positive impact on other people is a very important element to have in the business world.  He provided good examples and ideas about how we can use task significance to create the potential to make a huge impact on work performance in any job setting.  .,5
660,"Task significance is quite enlightening, yet common sense.  Task significance conceptualizes the effects that having the opportunity to physically see the results of one’s work.  Incentives are needed in every job, but task significance took it one step further to make contact to view the outcomes and inspire workers to remind them their work does not go unnoticed.  Places of business that encourage task significance will most likely have higher inspired employees with an even higher job performance rate.",4
660,"""Task Significance"" is really new to me, but after listening to the interview by Adam Grant, I realized ""Task Significance"" is important and useful for the company. Since the  ""Task Significance"" helps the company has the better connection between employees and customers, employees's responsibility are effected, and the customers are provided higher quality of service. ""Task Significance"" really benifits to the company.",5
660,"I totally agree that task significance is really important in a job, at least to keep the motivation going and to keep employees more happy and more productive with what they are doing. I never really focused on the concept of Task Significance before because in most of the jobs I've had they stress about getting things done faster and are more money orientated but in certain cases where I thought about what I was doing or how it would affect other people I felt more driven to work harder and better. I really think more workplaces should spend more time focusing on this.",5
660,This was a great podcast that thoroughly explains Task significance. I thought that it makes perfect sense that if a person that does work for someone or people gets to see how it benefits them they will feel alot better and be more motivated to do good.,5
660,"I believe Task significance plays a really important role in work environment. As the audio said, it is really important to have the employee to be motivated at work because if the employee is not motivated at work, people will lack off and not do what they are suppose to do. Also, employee really needs to be noticed for their work performance. Managers needs to evaluate teh employee work performance, so they can rewards the hard working employee and make sure the others work hard. If employees are not working together, this will effect on a lot of things in the company such as efficency, moral and the most important, team work. I believe the task significane is on the spot about working in a company.",4
660,"The podcast on Task Significance was very informative and well described.  I have to agree with the information provided.  As an employee it is important to know that your work is worth something, and as said, it is the managers who is responsible for motivating the employees (as Bill Gates did with his crew of testers and engineers). I’m partner in a company and sometimes I see that even my partners need motivation or they just wonder off, it is not because they are not interested in the work or they are tiered it is that some people tend to forget or see the big picture. They just have to be reminded about the set goals and the potential future of the company. Task significance plays a huge role in productivity, it creates an atmosphere we creative ideas are born and also are rewarded. Everybody likes to be appreciated and rewarded for their work no matter how small or insignificant their work is.Technical Remarks:the audio source  on podcast was good, it came in clear with out any distortions.",4
660,"To be honest, I have never heard of ""Task Significance"" prior to this podcast. It is rather interesting to hear that there are so many jobs that make a positive contribution towards and/or serve others. Many times we lose sight or forget about the effect of task significance. People in high task significance jobs tend to be more motivated and it tends to create more work efficiency.
I think this podcast is great, especially for business students. It reminds all of us of the importance of ""task significance"". It shows that if really believe that your job task can make a difference, you will be more motivated in doing what you do.
I like the example of the microsoft program developer. But I think ""task significance"" doesn't only work for big firms like microsoft, but for any organization and business.",4
660,"I think that this podcast was very informative and taught me something that I wasn't very aware of. It's a good idea to get people to see the results of their own work and that jobs could use task significance could be used to motivate employees. I agree that when jobs are very repetitive and the employees don't get to see how their work effects others that it might keep them from being interested and fully attentive. With task significance, employers can create a positive effect on their own employees. Without feedback people won't be aware of how their doing and won't be able find ways to help employees with their jobs.",4
660,"I thought the podcast regarding Task Significance was right on.  It is very important for people to feel that what they do at work has an influence on other people.  I think that in general, this relates to the importance of feedback in any business both positive and negative.  My family owns a grocery store and we make it a point to show our employees all of the feedback we receive from our customers both posative and negative so they can see that what they do has an effect on people's lives.  If employees become to detached they no longer care about whether they are doing good work or not.",5
660,"The podcast on Task Signifianc was extremely interesting.  It made perfect sence that employee's performance is directly affected by the meaning they find in their work.  Many people do not see value in the work they do, and because they find it unimportant tend to put less care into the type of work they do.  

Also, many people do have work that affects people live their lives, but sometimes these workers do not get to see th benefits of their work.  Examples would be researchers and authors.

If an employee knows that they are improving someones life, they often can find motivation to improve their duty and perform at a higher level.",5
660,"The podcast really did deliver the concept and points clearly. The voice of both parties could be heard clearly. Using real example such as Microsoft and Volvo for using the task significance allows me to see and understand the whole true meaning of task significance, along with its effects on employess motivation.It makes sense that if the employees do have a picture on what their jobs actually benefit other people, it would make them feel important and happy knowing that they had actually contributed to the people who benefit from it.Technical Remarks:So far everything is wonderful. Let's keep it up.",5
660,"I found ""Task Significance"" podcast rather interesting. Every good manager as well as an employee know that task significance is an important issue directly related to job performance. The examples of this podcast that is what made it very interesting and educational. Particularly the example of Microsoft showed that is is not an easy task for a manager to find creative and productive ways to remind employees about task significance. Especially when you work for a small company and don't have enough funds to make a one way mirror for this particular purpose. Overall I enjoyed this podcast.",4
660,"Task significant was very clearly explained in this podcast. I agree with him, if workers think and know that they are important and appreciated they would be more productive. If you are able to see the effects of your work, you are more likely to be more responsible and work harder.",4
660,"I thought the audio was very interesting, but it was something that i had already thought about. I agree that if people really feel that what they are doing actually has significance, that you are more motivated to do you job right and do it a lot better.Technical Remarks:non really. Just afraid that I'm not doing the right assignment.",4
660,I have never heard of task significance before I listened to this podcast. I felt this is very interesting and useful in all management works.,4
660,"Adam Grant has pointed out a very important point for improving of work participation to not only young people, but also everyone. I totally agree that Adam has stated that if the employee notice about their job can benifit to the society or some certain people, the employee could have more motive power.I believe that most of the people have dream to be a doctor, police or lawer when we were a kid scine we knew that those kind of job could help people and society. Of course, we can not all become police or doctor, therefore finding the truth meaning of the job can raise the efficeny of work a lot. That is not benifit to the company but also the employee. I believe that is the good way motive employee beside the bonus method.",4
660,"I think managers could make significant difference in the companies' productiveness and effectiveness by being aware of the importance of ""task significance"". People work in service industry may easier to feel the result of their work than people in other industries. When I think about some careers such as engineers, scholars, and reserachers,it is very difficult for them to feel how beneficial they can be for others and society. The example Adam gave was about lab engineers in medical company. He said that the company would hold a party where the patient who used the medical instrument made by the company and the engineers could meet,so that the engineers would realize how great impact they are making on the users. The task significance indeed motivate workers and increase employee's productivity.",4
660,"it was very interesting to listen to some of these real life examples about the effects of increasing task significance for professions with a high invisible task significance, but was any of it actually new? 
the concept of task significance is relatively easy to understand. when you can see the positive affects your work has, it is always a good motivation tool. working in retail, i judge my days work on my numbers, which can get old quick, but when i help organize the stock room, i can physically see the difference i made that day.
i agree that making some of these jobs with invisible task significance, more visible, like the life guard, volvo, and microsoft, has a positive effect, but the concept isnt new. he just brought some real life examples to the table. 
however, these examples, specific to the industry, were what i felt, the take home message. innovation in the way we do business to increase T.S. among employees is the key. listening to what some different examples he gave can help start the creative juices, and make way for change.
all in all, it was an interesting podcast but i believe they took 15 minutes to describe something that could have been done in three. 
but then again, maybe that extra 12 minutes was their visible task significance.",3
660,"This podcast is great. When it comes to task significance I find recognition and motivation very important. For example, as Mark Adam explained, sometimes we have a high expectation about a job which then turns out to be repetitive and boring. However, the fact that the job is not as exciting as we thought doesn't mean that the job has low significance. This is when task significance recognition comes in. It is important to analyze and recognize the impact that our job has on others. The examples introduced in the podcast clearly indicate that knowing the task significance increases motivation. One suggestion could be to bring closer the people doing the task and the people that are affected by it. There are some examples such as meetings, and success stories that work great for building motivation. However, I think that the best part is that there is plenty of room for creativity.",4
660,This podcast interview with Adam Grant was very helpful for young people.  I totally agree with their point about this job participation. Most of the employee want to know how their job benefit on society.If the customer or society is not satisfied  with the end product or service. The corporation can be improved or find a solution for this.  Its important to see how society thinks because without their comments  product wouldn't be notice where they should improved. It's very important to know that.,4
660,It's OK,3
660,I thought this was a very informative pod-cast. I would recommend it to anyone interested in motivating people to their full potential. The guest speaker sheds light on a simple yet overlooked and unappreciated concept. I was buzzing with ideas after listening to this. pod-cast,5
660,"Task significance is something that I believe is lacking in most companies. Like they stated in the podcast, there are many companies who do not communicate the task significance of the work they do to their employees. This causes employees to feel under appreciated at times. I believe that letting them know their task significance would help motivate workers, and give them a sense of satisfaction in their work, creating a happier enviornment.",3
660,"The podcast interview with Adam Grant was interesting. Stating that as employees seeing your works effect on society can either be a motivator towards continuing the work or finding new ways to make it better, if the consumer or society is not happy with the end product or service. 

As employees its important to see how society thinks because without their input or criticism the end product wouldn't be improved. And the employees wouldn't get the benefit of knowing that their services/products have been of great use or not to the public.",4
660,I think Adam Grants view on the effects of Task Significant was great.  I agree that if a person who does a job and gets to know that their work had some significant into someones life is a great motivator.  But I think it should go both ways.  Their might be jobs that you do good for someone and might not go so well to another.  Employees should know about all effects of their task significant.  I think Athletes who go to fund-raising events have some interactive to their task significant because they get involved into the work.  Though most of it is PR but they still come for even just a couple of hours during the day.  Adam explains about motivation reguarding task significant.  I would agree that it makes an impact to know what good you have done in your task.  example are the firemen and police officers that helped and worked to help people during 9/11.  ever since then NYPD and NYFD have gain much respect from people and their motivation have increased.,4
660,"I think Adam Grant recommendations about task significances are great because I truly think it is important to let employees know that their work makes a different. I believe it will boost confident in employees and make them want to performance at their best when they are acknowledge for their work. From what Adam mention in the Podcast, ""managers should create forums for employees where they share their stories"", I think is a wonderful idea because it lets employees open up to each other. It also allows employees to learn from each others experiences. I think managers should consider applying task significance with their employees because employees performance will be higher since they are feeling good about themselves, knowing that others are benefiting from their work.",4
660,As a student and a current supervisor this podcast really was inspirational. I am very motivated as a new supervisor but my staff could use some connection with the results of their work. I happen to work in the research field so Under New Management handed me the perfect scenario for my staff.,5
660,"This Podcast really helps me to learn a lesson. I never realized Task Significance is important and make a lot of different in our jobs. Most people don't think their work can benefit others in some ways, therefore, job seems like a way to feed ourselves an d the family. From the Podcast, i know that it can increase the motivation of the employees simply by make them realize how their daily work benefit some people even most people in the world. i think all companies should consider about the task significance in their work.",5
660,"This is a very TRUE idea. From my personal experience, I have realized that motivating your employees on task significance makes the biggest difference in the world. I have worked behind the scenes jobs where I was basically doing the same task over and over like a machine. Yet, I had no idea how it affected the customers. Therefore, I did fond myself un-motivated and lazy at times. Yet last summer, I got the opportunity to work as a college adviser/tutor for UC Berkeley. All of us advisers went into 'bad' middle school and had to educate the young teens on the benefits of going to college, the requirements needed, and how to go about applying. At first it was just a routine performance that we did: go into classroom, present information, answer questions, leave. Then one day, we actually saw students come in with their parents that wanted more information. That basically meant that the kids listened and were interested! We had made a difference in their lives! That made it all worth while. Soon after, the rest of the tutors and I were motivated to get more kids on our sides. Our task significance was high, but we just didn't know about it, until we saw the results. So I think that as managers of any sort, or even colleagues and employees, we must recognize the task significance and let it help us help others!",5

660,"It was interesting to hear the results of this study on how employees react to task significance, because while it's important to know how to effectively organize the work environment, most employees will need the motivation and ability to see the results of their work to continue working at a high performance level most management will desire. While most common workers task significance won't result in having saved someone's life, seeing even the smallest impact from work done can help motivate the employee to continuously work hard.",4
660,"Task Significance is such an important underlying component to quality perfomance execution, that it should be always focused on and addressed in planning.  It's easy to get fixated on one process for operations that occur day to day where duties are compartmentalized and segmented. An example, in which the podcast discusses, would be software quality assurance.  At first glance, a QA Tester could see his or her role as just finding and ammassing large bug numbers and verfying fixes.  They could miss the critical signifance of the overall reason for their position, which is to help carry out the development roadmap and ultimately improve the product quality.  Showing the complete picture and tieing in the direct contribution value to a duty has a great motivational boost effect.  When there is more motivation, the easier and more effective completing an action can be.  Isn't that what management should be seeking, to ultimately increase productivity?  An employee with a directed reason is better than employee that is lost without.",5
660,"I'm sure at some point we've all had the jobs that were boring and monotonous, but sometimes it's so hard to tell when you're in that cycle. Your monotonous job keeps you busy doing the same thing that you're too busy to stop doing it. Managers definitely need to be trained to keep employees motivated and show them that all their work is for a purpose. Task significance is what can keep a company going, all people, high managers and hourly employees need to feel appreciated.",4
660,"The results of a successful company/ organization depend on a high level of task significance. Being a teacher at more than one school has full fulfillment of task significance. Seeing my students learn firsthand and personal satisfies me in a way where I see the effects and difference I make in their lives each week. Motivating young vibrant students is a huge benefit for me to experience in the world of business, management, and even entrepreneurship.",5
660,I think that motivating people is a key in business. Task significance is highly recommended between people because it makes employees satisfied and will be effective to increase company's benefit in the future.,4
660,"Interesting video that raised an important point about today's workplace. It is pertinent that employees explore and recognize the impact and significance of their work. Rather than looking at work as a job, a person may possibly find work more meaningful when they understand how what they do benefits their clients/organization. Upper management should be aware of a lack of task significance in their employees. In order to maintain high morale, it would be beneficial for the entire company if the senior staff implement some sort of entity that visualized or measured end-user satisfaction in order to increase motivation and work satisfaction. One such entity could be a feedback survey on the companies website that customers could complete that would evaluate customer satisfaction of the product. Such satisfaction represents the successful work of the employees.",4
660,"I found this material and information to be not only entertaining but also very useful for the present and future. I agree that showing employee's that their jobs do have some sort of task significance is very important and i do believe that this leads to much more motivated and efficient employees. I found it very useful that they thoroughly explained every concept of task significance and gave examples for everything. I look forward to applying this not only to future situations, but also my present situation.",5
660,"As a manager or executive officer, it is important to understand the importance of task significance. By letting the employees to know the result of their works will help them make corrections and derive the quality of their work. Also, it also helps the managers to find out which employee or department needs a change. In addition, by knowing how significant or beneficial their work is, the company will have a better advantage in competing with other companies in the market.",4
660,"I just finished listening to the podcast by Mark Adam and I have to say that ""Task Significance"" is important in getting a productive employee.  I have had a ton of minimum wage jobs, I have never felt like I was making a difference and consequently I never worked as hard as I could have because to me it didn't matter.  Adam makes a lot of great examples of how even tasks that I wouldn't have thought had task significance did indeed have task significance.  I always have thought of paramedics or health care professionals as the only professions that had any kind of task significance, but I ways proved wrong after listening to this podcast.  Making people realize the benefit to the world that their job is making seems like such an easy thing to remind employees of, but it happens so little of the time.  I think this is one of the best management practices I have heard, I wish that my employer would listen to this podcast.",4
660,"going to work is a necessity since it is a way to provide for living costs. However, if that becomes the main reason to go to work, it's hard to want to go to work. What stuck with me about task significance is how it connects to motivation. Especially for invisible task significance. People that work behind the scene don't feel the significance of their work so it makes sense that they lose their motivation. Motivation has to come from some where and as a manager, coming up with ideas to motivate employees is challenging. As an employee that works at a cash register at a restaurant, I don't just give change to customers I also let waitresses know if a customer needs assistance. After hearing this podcast, I plan to change the way I do work to liven up how things go at work. This will motivate me as well as other employees.",4
660,one of the examples give in the podcast is about Microsoft programmers try so hard to fix the bug so other users benefits and update to prevent intruders hack into other pc.,5
660,"A very nice podcast on Task significance. The examples given by Adam are very related to the real world. Knowing that the job would make a postive difference on other people, i belive, most employees would have more motivation in their work. They may even be more satisfy with their work than others who just work 9 hrs a day, 7 days a week. It;s true that most of those people whose work is cosider task significance never got a chance to meet those they helped, this does lowered the motivation of their work because they dont know if their work really are making a differences. By having direct contact, they could see and know that others are benefiting from their work. After listening to the podcast, i think about PG&E. They are applying task significance to our daily lives, where they try to save energy, save money and save our world.",5
660,"It's odd how closely this podcast relates to my work experience. I worked as a fundraiser for the university for over a year and what Adam described was the truth word for word. There is a huge lack in motivation, our job was not easy or pleasant, and many people quit after a short period of time. Following an insensitive scrip and talking to people who projected genuine hatred was just a few of the perks that came with the job description. I believe the only reason why I was able to stand it so long (yes a year is a long time in this field) and have reasonable success was because of task significance. I knew that on the surface my job seemed like telemarketing, but I really took to heart that I was helping students receive financial aid, as well as a number of other sectors. Those of my coworkers around that didn't view their job the same way lost contact with this key element and either quit or were bad at raising money. I often wondered why we didn't have motivational objectives like the ones described in the pod cast, on the contrary the motivation was always about how much we raised instead of who we raised it for. Task significance has always been important for all jobs, it is only common sense that it increases productivity, some more than others, so why aren't more managers utilizing  it?",5
660,"In the podcast, Mark Adam explains why task significance is so important to managers and employees. When I was a waitperson, I was often encouraged by my customers. However, some workers never have a chance to meet people who benefits from their work, so they may not find the meaning of their work. Mangers can use task significance to motivate their workers and improve their job performance. Many people can enjoy their work by knowing that they are helping others. Managers should make opportunities to make their workers realize the meaning of their work as Adam suggests.",4
660,"This seemed like a valuable insight into motivating employees faced with tasks that are isolating or repetitive. Allowing them to see the results of their efforts brings them back to the value of what they do. It seemed that the more close the employees were brought to the beneficiaries of their work, the more effective it would be. Not surprisingly, the more motivated workeers were effected more by this experience.",4
660,"I found the material in this podcast about Under New Management very significant and helpful. What I found very interesting about task Significant is that it doesn't just apply to fireman and police officers who do good work every day. Task Significance applies to anyone that does work to benefit another person. The examples Adam gives in the podcast were outstanding. The one that relates to me the most is the lack of task significance in the work force, that's when someone does work for another person but doesn't see the impact of there work. The reason why this relates to me the most is because I have worked on trail maintenance before and even though somebody may see the impact of my work, they will never know who did that job. I agree with the podcast and say Task Significance is a great deal in the job world.",3
660,"I think Adam's Task Significance podcast was very interesting and helpful. I think Task Significance is an important idea that can improve a work environment. I also thought learning about invisible task significance was important because people don't realize that their everyday jobs make a big impact on people's lives. It is the mechanics job to fix the car and make sure the car is safe for the people, but the people don't realize how important it is. It is great to affect people's lives in a positive way because you will help them view things in a positive way. For example, I think teachers that emphasize Task Significance make a bigger impact on their class and ultimately do better. When people hear positive compliments, they tend to work better and they have a more positive outlook on everything. I think everyone would agree that getting a compliment is nice and definitely brightens your day or your mood. I think no matter what job you have, you can use task significance and brighten someone's day.  After learning about the impact of task significance, I know that the relationship between people and task significance is important and can ultimately have a positive impact on other lives. Overall, the impact of task significance is unlimited and the more task significance we emphasize, the more we can make a difference.",4
660,"Adam's Task Significance podcast has completely changed my mind about the employees' psychological condition and the relationship between the manager and his/her employees. Writers, life guards, and educational advisers, as Adam mentioned, are one of the many people who contribute to society, but they don't realize it. If you break the barriers of communication between managers, employees, customers, and consumers, everyone has opportunity to learn from one another and reap the benefits. The importance of task significance is it shows you how your work is benefiting others, and it motivates you to work harder because you're working to help others, not just yourself. Interestingly, this concept reminds me of companies in Japan, where their employees are committed to their jobs, remain loyal to their superiors, and take pride in their work, because they believe they’re contributing to a greater cause. The brilliance of task significance is it can be applied to any level of work. If you’re a manager, sharing task significance with your employees creates the opportunity for your workers to feel like they're apart of a team, rather than just an employee.",4
660,"Based on Mark Adams, task significance have positive impact on other people. Especially for the employs, it connects between the employs and users or people who get benefit from the employs. Also, the employs can share their experience about importance of their work. Positively, the connection and the experience help employs have motivation and responsibility, so managers are able to increase efficiency and productivity. From Hofstede’s research, uncertainty is one of factors which affects working environment, so getting rid of the uncertainty by the task significance can positively affects people.",4
660,"I found this podcast very helpful to listen to and very easy to relate to. I find it difficult to find task significance in normal retail especially if its superficial. It is difficult to see how I am helping a woman by selling her overpriced clothing. I think that however, task significance is important to apply not only in the work place, but in school. Task significance can be an extremely useful tool for teachers to keep their less enthusiastic students motivated about a topic by relating it to a real life goal that they want to achieve.",4
660,"The relationship between task significance and people is important as this is shown in the podcast. Since task significance can increase performance of both company and workers, it is good to be used effectively.  For example, Microsoft builds user ability lab to increase communication with purchasers and makes product to be more user friendly. Task significance improves relationship between customers and company from the impacts, also increases job performance of employees. Therefore task  significance leads company to be successful.",4
660,"Task significance is very important for employees I believe, because in my opinion, the more challenging the task is the harder you work to increase your job performance and to get your stuff done. It does seem that people enjoy their work more when they have to do more challenging things, and they appreciate their jobs even more, rather than having a dull and boring task that is very easy. 
I liked his examples of management, and how he presented the part of giving employees the benefit of the doubt on more complicated tasks because that gives them more of a challenge, and they work harder as well as enjoy their job even more.",4
660,A very interesting view on how task significance relates to increased productivity and morale on employees onto a company.  Adam uses great examples showing how the use of positive reinforcement helps employees see the work they do helps the company overall.  Giving a sense of accomplishment and aligning it with the company's plan more often than not will help tremendously in the long run.  We could all use more excellent use of task significance to employees to make more productive and profitable business culture.,4
660,"In my opinion, task significant is impossible to applied to every employees. It is hard for everyone to realize the importance of their jobs in order to increase the job performance without any restriction and regulation. For example, I am working in Coscto Wholesale as a cashier assistant right now. Since i am on the three months probation right now, I am working so hard to show that I am belong to this company. I realize the importance of this job for me; so, I work hard. If there is no probation, I don't think that I will work as hard as right now. I will just work in a slower pace, which will absulotely decrease my job performance. Thus, I believe the task significant is not reaistic for every employees in any industry.",3
660,"It is a very interesting Podcast. The interview in the Podcast explains very clearly of phases of task significance. Now I know what task significance represents and how it works and why it is import in management. Task significance is making an employee knows how his work may and will increase other people’s life. Through getting the direct information of how significant of his work to other people and the society, one may put more passion and take more responsibilities in his work. For example, when a person works on some products, the failure rate (it is impossible to make the failure rate to be zero) is just a number to him. The worker may just take his routine work, not too bad, not too good. However, when he fully understand through talking with customers how trouble even danger of one failed product on market may bring to people, the worker will pay more attention in his work and try his best to decrease the failure rate. Hence, task significance is a very important concept in management. Managers should apply this concept in their real managements.",4
660,An interesting podcast about the really important motivator of task significance and its impact on the lives of employees and people in general. Task significance task is accomplished when the employee is deemed integrated into the organization and understand the contribution their work makes to society or to another department. How useful it sees its task. I really liked the Microsoft programmers example because it illustrates how task significance can be used everywhere. They did something more user friendly by having contact with the real users of their product.,4
660,"The podcast on task significance contained very useful information. Before listening to the podcast, I didn't know there was such a term to describe it. Task significance is beneficial for the employee as well as the company. If an employee sees how their work is directly effecting someone or something, they have a sense of importance. The company benefits from the employees job satisfaction. Their happiness at work translates into more productive work.",4
660,"This podcast had opened my eyes on how important task significance for work environment. Task significance, if used effectively, can increase the productivity of a company activities. By having more social interaction between employees and customer, everybody will going to benefit the impact of task significance. Employees can stay motivated in enjoying their job, while customers will benefit the products of the company. In conclusion, it is an essential tool for building a successful company.",4
660,"Task significance is an essential factor of a job’s characteristics because it increases job performance by making the employee feel the importance of his work in making a difference in helping others or changing someone’s life to the better such as doctors and teachers etc..Psychologically it is a great element in inspiring and motivating employees in any work place since it gives the worker a sense of importance inside and outside his organization.  It is amazing to know that some experiments showed that motivation arises when workers meet with people that benefit from their work, while others that did not get the chance to do so they don’t realize their task significance which results in giving a moderate output comparing to the other group.",5
660,Task significance is a great tool to boost the motivation of employees. Once you understand how your day to day work helps other people you feel a sense of meaning. Higher pay and promotions can only go so far. Most employees just want to make a difference and Mike Johnson hits the nail on the head with this podcast. A must listen!,5
660,"Listening to the podcast I was able to realize just how much task significance impacts job performance.  Anybody is happy when they are able to do work that has a positive impact on other people, because there is the sense of giving back and helping someone who might not have had the opportunity. People like fireman are heavily recognized for this but it can be done in every business, even though most people don't know it. The hard part about it is that it is easy to lose sight of the impact, especially when the employees are not able to meet the actual people that are doing justice for. Overall, the results vary from employees being more satisfiedwith work, work being more meaningful, and more motivation to perform effectively. i know personally I would love to work at a job where the highlight is how the change we are causing will help others and that everyone at the company is working to make a difference. That in itself would be enough motivation for me to go to work everyday and try my very best. I really agree when he was saying that a big part is to introduce employees to the people who benefit from their work because then they can really see the impact they have on the people. An example that popped up into my head when listening to the podcast is financial aid making it possible for myself and many other students to access higher education.  This is huge for people especially that come from a family that cannot pay for them to go to school, especially with things like tuition going up.  Alot of people are being left out of the equation but many people are put in it as well.  To be able to meet the people that make this possible I think they would really notice just how much of an impact financial aid really has on the students fortunate enough to receive it.  Overall, I think the podcast touched on a lot of key points and made me think about if I will start my own business or even join a company, the values that I want to pertain.Technical Remarks:Blank screen but could hear the audio. Also, wish there was a pause section for jotting notes and not missing anything.",4
660,"This is a very interesting concept. I'm also amazed this research started pretty long ago. I find that it's very true that we need that motivation to keep us working at our highest potential. it would be boring going to work and doing the same thing everyday, but to see your work impacting lives of people that's something to make you work harder. That must be why firefighters love their job- dangerous but rewarding to save lives.",4
660,"This is great, a further look into the specifics of job fulfillment. Pinpointing that it's not necessarily the tasks at hand, but seeing the difference they make that motivates employees to do better. Improving task significance for workers is a win/win situation. Employees will feel good about what they do be more productive and the company's profit wil go up because of the increase in their employee productivity.

I follow Adam Grant's belief ""that most employees want to make a difference. They care about helping others in some particular way."" Most people want to help others and getting the chance to do that and then see how you personally impact people's lives in a positive way is very encouraging. It's like one of the clips I saw this semester that was probably connected with this class where prisoners doing life were making wheelchairs for people who needed them, but could not afford them and one prisoner become a pastor in the prison to give other prisoners something to turn to and believe in. 

One aspect of task significance for employees in the fastfood industry is how appreciative people are of their services. While it's not enough to keep the workers at their post as the restaurant industry has the highest turnover rates, the top three reasons to explain the turnover rate are the low wage, the pressure to be more productive, and no motivation to actually continue doing the job.

When I was working at a Subway. It was nice to hear people say how great looking a sandwich I made was or even how great tasting it was or was going to taste even though sandwiches were suppose to taste the same no matter who makes it. The best compliments I got from customers were when a retired man who had been traveling around the country with his wife in their RV for over 10 years and always made a stop at Subways along their routes, said that I made the best looking sandwiches he'd seen and he's seen a lot of sandwiches; when customers look like they are in genuine awe, when people said thank you, and people who go out of their way to leave a tip.Technical Remarks:I wish the audio player had a timer thing, I had to find sequences I wanted to re-listen to by guesswork. Streaming subtitles would be great, but be a lot of work. Also, there didn't seem to any other way to download the Podcast to your computer unless you buy the new Quicktime player which I don't plan to buy.",4
660,"I completely agree with what Adam is saying.  What employers tend to forget is that people aren't always selfish.  Employees feel a sense of achievement for making a difference, especially if it helps another person out.  For example, I work at a coffee shop that donates coffee to the troops.  When our cafe first started the donation process, the employees weren't trying very hard. We did, however, manage to donate a decent amount and ship it out to Afghanistan.  After a few months, we actually had some troops come in the store. They thanked us for our help and told us that they really appreciated it.  Knowing that we made a difference, our cafe employees started to try so much harder than before.  Our coffee donations are now through the roof! The fact that we actually had the chance to meet some of the people we're helping caused us to realize that we are making a difference.",4
660,"A lot of this information is very relevant to not just people in the business sector; but to anyone that is working.  There is a lot of information on how the workplace may function and that proves itself just as valuable as any classroom lecture.  
Things like ""Task Significance"" and how motivated workers are depending on the task at hand.  ""Discrimination"" at the workplace where the victims may plateau their career early because of misconceptions of the decisionmakers and so on.",4
660,"Adam Grant’s task significance is amazingly true! If you think about it, many people are inspired to help others especially those who are in need. When we help those in need and realize the impact we have made in someone’s life, we encourage ourselves to keep giving back. Majority of the time we help others is through the kindness of our hearts and not for monetary incentives. But if we were fortunate enough to have a high task significance job, where we get paid for helping others and realize the impact of our help, thus makes Grant’s evidence that workers are more likely to be more productive! Thus benefiting everyone!",4
660,"The explanation about ""invisible task significance"" makes sense to me. It happened to me quite often. I performed a significant amount of work that was considered to be helpful and beneficial for company and other workers. I volunteered to do that and did not expect to be awarded or repaid. However, my contribution tent to be ignored after a while because they got used to the fact that I was supposed to do that. I had the feeling of being taken for granted when my efforts were not appreciated. These situations are very common in workplaces.",4
660,"I found this is very true, practical and useful to know. In every job, most people tend to be proud and more motivated if they have a real sense of how their works affect other people in a positive way. It's to our own benefit too if we realize how important, meaningful and useful for the sake of others in need. We feel a sense of self-fulfilment. And as a result, we tend to be more effective and productive to work for higher performance. When I was working as a tutor in my previous college, it felt very great and proud if I got to know for myself that I actually help my tutees improve their performance in class. And I think it helped me to better perform at work as well. It's very crucial for employees to be able to see how their works really make a difference for social contribution so that it helps them to have higher task significance performance at work. The video was very interesting and true in real life.

660,Wow!!! I never thought about his subject the way he was explaining it. people really don't notice that they make a difference in the world. I myself never thought about that i make a difference when i go to work.,5
660,"I found this pod cast very interesting. Prior to listening I did not know what Task Significance was. I learned that Task Significance is the positive impact on those who you work with and those who you are serving. A job high in task significance is a job that produces high benefits to others. I found it very interesting how Adam mentioned that many workers never realize or appreciate their task significance because they never meet those who benefit from their work. If workers realize their task significance the quality of work, amount of motivation, and satisfaction of work will rise greatly.I truly believe if I better realized the task significance in work that I perform, I would be much more excited about what I am producing and would strive for better performance.",5
660,"I find this interview very usefull to a everybody ( corporations, managers, employees)because task significance is very important but alot of employers and employees dont realized how task significance is important. In my situation were I work in customer service I like to hear that customers enjoyed my movie reviews or suggestions it keeps me motivated to watch movies so I can continue to give reviews and suggestions to my customers. And the first recommendation of Adam Grant was to make connections with software developers and users is a great idea because that way there's motivation of both sides. To know that someone is using your product to the fullest is a great motivation to continue to build great products.",4
660,"This was an interesting podcast that included research and delving into actual jobs that seem monotonous/non-motivating. The ""experiments"" and ""interventions"" were successful in their objectives.
The speaker Adam Grant was interesting and knowledgeable in his work. He seemed to know exactly what his objective was, and how to achieve success. He also was able to give ideas for managers on how to give their employees motivation (task significance). It was clear that the best motivation for most employees was for the employees to meet and talk with people who directly benefit from their work.Technical Remarks:Audio cut in and out...unsure if that was from loading or from the actual podcast. Unable to pause.",4
660,"The overall interview isn't the greatest in my opinion. It's mainly Mike Johnson asking short questions to Adam Grant. However I do think that the material and what was found during the study and experiments is quite interesting. I never looked as far to think that Task Significance played such a big role on employees. I thought it was very interesting when the studies were constructed and was even more impressed with the results. The people who called the alumni for donations, basically being telemarketers, have a tough job in the sense that they get hung up on all the time. I would never feel motivated to do that job. And the life guards who never save anyone form drowning and instead just sit there wouldn't be motivated to work either. However when people were brought in who received the scholarship because of the people making the calls or lifeguards who actually saved people were brought in to meet other lifeguards, the people were then motivated and ended up working longer hours for a longer period of time. 

I also thought the extended research was interesting as well with the two dimensions of personality and values, those being consciousness and certain values.

After listening to this, I agree with their conclusion and think that managers should realize that employees aren't always self interested and actually like helping other people. The employee just needs to see that they are actually making a difference.",4
660,"Adam Grant’s concept of task significance shows great research on how task significance does make a big impact in the job force. He explains that the higher the task significance the more satisfied you will be with your job. Also, your performance would increase because you are motivated and understand how meaningful your job truly is. If you are looking to improve and motivate your employees or a certain group of people, Adam Grant’s concepts will prove that task significance does play a huge role in order of maintaining motivated employees.",5
660,"After listened to the audio, i realized that is very important to motivated your employees, they are the one who make the business for company. Task Significance is necessary in business. Because the employees knows that they have make  different in the job, they get more satisfaction from the job, and feel like they are belonging here. So this is win win situation for both company and employees.",4
660,Great examples of task significance. It clearly explained what task significance is. I was unsure on exactly what task significance was before I listened to this. It makes you really think. I agree with this presentation because if your appreciated and have importance in your job you will work harder.,4
660,"I though this podcast is really a good eye-opener because I think it makes people realize and become aware of their job and how their jobs might have some task significant or invisible task significant.   Especially the example about life guards and how they go into the job with high motivation, but then become less motivated because there is a small possibility that they will have to rescue someone. I really like this example because I use to be a life guard and it really gets boring after a while of not doing much to ""help"" save someone or help make an impact on someone's life.",5
660,"The concept of task significance is clearly introduced in this podcast; it is the about the benefits to employees when they understand or realize the significance of their work, in particular, how their work makes a difference to others. Studies showed that employees had less turnover and better performance when they knew or saw the difference(s) their work made.  This information is important to businesses and to managers within organizations because they may be able to use this information to motivate their employees, increase job satisfaction and performance.",5
660,"It seems like interacting and connecting in some way with the customers’ recipients of our work is a key for future motivation and inspiration that can help any worker in any field to be more successful.
I totally agree with the fact that Task significance and Job performance is the best combination to make a business succeed, and Adam Grant has proven that with a few examples on his interview. If any worker has the chance to see the result and impact his or her job does in another’s people’s life his or her job performance will improve and will become very motivating in the future.
It is a very interesting topic which also points fingers to the lack of responses, values and social responsibilities that some employers have; giving the goals of the business first priority without helping in any way to achieve that.  At this point is when Task Significance on Job Performance can make a big difference in any workers performance and also in any business nowadays or in the years to come.",5
660,"Task Significance is an important knowledge to know because it is motivation and productivity to its employees. A job is not only doing and working. If I know my job will benefit and help other people, I will feel this job is meaningful and helpful. So I agree with the podcast that Task Significance is a great idea of a job.",4
660,I realized we take for granted when it come to our job task.  We forget that the smallest things that make a differences in our line of work from the computer to the staff that make our business run smoothly. I think we need to take a step back and look at what we can do to improve our work environment and ourselves.,4
660,"The interview was engaging in explaining the concept of task significance. The fact that several examples were used to illustrate the concept definitely elevated my understanding. It also made me apply it to the industry I currently work in. I work in the accounting department of a local medical research company. Studies include patients' chronic pain/addiction. While I do not work directly with our patients, I can understand why my co-workers are very passionate about the work they do. I can now relate how task significance is a major driving factor for the people working in my company. And I'm happy to be part of the support staff team to help our researchers take that one step closer in doing work that has a positive effect on the well being of our patients.",4
660,"This was an intriguing interview. Task significance is very important in every work place. For me, I get more motivated when I know that what I'm working on will benefit somebody. I think this is why volunteering is so popular. All managers should create an environment that promotes task significance instead of having a ""just do your job"" belief. Adam Grant's research was very revealing, though not surprising to me. Monotonous tasks are boring and most people don't enjoy doing them. This just adds negativity to the  business, which in the long run is counter-productive. If an employee thinks that they will be making a difference, managers should encourage that and be supportive. Having a positive impact on people is very rewarding and helps keep society going.",5
660,"The podcast on task significance is interesting. Though it seems logical that when one at a job has the mind that what he or she is doing can potentially help others, then the job is just that much more fulfilling and meaningful which hopefully will lead to increased productivity.",5
660,"The Task Significance concept really caught my attention. I never saw it that way before, and the way Adam Grant explained it through his examples were effective. I work at a restaurant, so it's different than working in a cubicle for a company. Whereas the cubicle worker doesn't see the impact he/she is making, working at the restaurant I get to see how people react to the food they eat. For the most part, people enjoy what they eat a the place I work at. So it's more rewarding and motivating when I receive high tips. It means I am doing my job and people enjoy my service.",4
660,"The ""Task Significance"" material is great.  The ideas expressed in the material is concise and straightforward to the point.  Before I listened to it, I didn't really get what task significance could mean to the management.  After I learned from the speaker, I perceived the speaker's idea clearly.  Not only I understand the positive impact of task significance in motivation of employees, I especially appreciate the three ways recommended by the speaker to make task significant for employees.  These recommendations are useful and practical.",4
660,"As an IT major I would probably not see this a lot. But as my current position as a Sales Associate, task significance is really important to ensure that the customer leave happy and would return to buy more. I believe it is a great motivating benefit to see direct benefit from your work place.",4
660,"""Under New Management"" is an extremely important podcast to listen to. The role of managers has changed as individuals have been acknowledged as being people and contributors rather then mere pawns in a business cycle. High Task significance creates a sense of urgency for workers as they can immediately coincide what they are doing with why it is important. In the past, most workers had low task significance and therefore lower morale, less initiative, and a lack of connection to the job they are doing. Morale and psychological considerations are extremely important as people become more aware of their own individuality. As a victim of a verbally abusive boss, I can personally attest to the drastic impact a negative work experience has on an ongoing basis in ones life. It takes over your mood at work, after work, before work, and on weekends. Negativity from the top down may have worked in an environment where mindless production was key and one was fired if they didn't keep up, but in an evolving spectrum of ""self"", it is imperative that new managerial strategy keeps the well-being and commitment of workers in mind.Technical Remarks:Very clean site, easy to use, extremely informative",5
660,"According to the interview about recovering from work with Professor Sabine Sonnentag.As we know that many people have experienced disengaging from work in the evening affects people's mood in the next morning. Therefore, this is an important issue for organization and manager to help their employee to stay healthy and high quality performance at work as well. As a manager, he/she should respect employee time after work by not calling and sending e-mail about work to an employees. As the result, employees can have relaxing time without thinking about work when they are home.They can have time for families, sports and etc. Consequently, if employees have good mood in the evening after work, their work performance will be great as well.",4
660,"Under New Management, Mike Johnson interviewed Adam Grant, who creating the idea of task significance. Adam Grant's task significance is according to him is a fancy work for having a opportunity to do work that has positive impact on the well-being of people. Job with higher task significance mean job that contribute toward people. An example of job that high task significance are firemen and doctors. One concern with task signifance is that employee may sometime feel disconnected towards work. This is an example of invisble task significance where the employee can't foresee the positive impact it has on others. Type of employee that fall under this category are mechanic, doctor, and authors. Mechanic can fix cars to be safe for people to ride in. Doctors can create vaccine to help cure patient with illness. And authors could write books that even help change people lives. In general the thought is that higher task significant comes through great motivation and could make a difference people lives.Technical Remarks:This website function great and is easy to use.",4
660,"it's very interesting podcast and it talk a lot of about issues regarding employees' psychological condition. howover, i think the early warning sign of burnout is useful and helpful for employees to understand their condition. on the other hands, maslach knew that employees maybe have difficulties in doing their work. however, empployees can't find out their problems and don't know how to solve the problem.Technical Remarks:easy to understant the information",4
660,After hearing the Podcast about under new management. Task significance at your job is having an opportunity to do work that does good that also help others. It has a strong effect on motivation. You tend to be more satisfied with your work and find it more motivating when your aware of the task significance job performance at your work. It helps to keep employees aware to be more productive in the workplace. The main key is that task significance helps to keep workers motivated and attentive.Technical Remarks:The merlot website is great place to share information and opinions,5
660,"The podcast addresses issues regarding employees' psychological condition and the relationship between employers and employees.  Among all of the podcasts, I think the one called Early Warning signs of Burnout is very helpful for employees to understand their psychological condition and learn to prevent full-blown burnout. For instance, in the podcast, DR. Maslach indicates that employees might have difficulties in coping with six problems areas-job demands, stress, unfair treatment, relationship with their employers, lack of respect from co-workers and core values. However, if employees can recognize their problem in advance and solve the problem, they would know how to prevent full-blown burn out.Technical Remarks:no difficulties in using the material",4
660,"Concept of ""Task Significant"", by Adam Grant is very inspiring and informative. Grants video helped me to understand the meaning of Task Significant. I think it is very important for managers and employees to understand this concept. Not only it just motivates employees to do the work but it also increases production and quality of work done. When employee feel that his or her role is important in an organization, they will make more effort and it will automatically increase the production and quality of work.",5
660,"It is amazing what a difference the task significance can make. After listening to podcast, I started to wonder how my future career will benefit people.I think if I were reminded how beneficial my work was to others, I would be more proud of the work I do, and would be willing to work harder. I think it is especially important for people who work at the offices or labs and do not have an opportunity to see the impacts of their work directly. I think if people are reminded of importance of their job, they realize the significance of their job. No longer do they feel like they are doing an ordinary job at the office cubicle, but instead they are helping people, whom they might never meet, yet that idea motivates them to work harder and achieve success. I would certainly consider the importance of task significne in my future career.",4
660,"A very interesting podcast that put a word on a very broad subject and factors that affect a organization and management decisions. I've never heard of task significance but i think it applies to almost any job or career that we will do in the future. Recognition for work,and  understanding how our work can positively affect others directly leads to work satisfaction and motivation is a powerful tool for organizations and management to understand.",4
660,"I agree with Adam Grandt in the Podcast “Under New Management”. It just makes sense, for an employee working in a high significant job, to be more motivated and put more effort into their job if they can see the outcome. If they can see what difference their contribution made in someone else’s life. Many people are sacrificing a lower wage choosing a job that is in high significance. To know that their work and effort made a social contribution and helped someone else is very satisfactory to many employees. So I totally agree that their should be a connection between the worker and the person who is going to benefit from it. Maybe companies can host some kind of presentation once a year after interviewing the end users.",4
660,"the podcast is very meaningful and interesting  to me because it tells me how the task significance to be a motivation for companies and their employees. Also, it,s important to let employees know how important can be if they know how to performace their job.",5
660,I think the podcast was great and very interesting. I think everything he said is so true. Yeah it's nice to be influenced to do well on the job to get that promotion or award at the end of the month but being able to see your work being put into affect can be really touching and influential. The example he gave about the medical company I think was the best. Because when you are in a field that provides medical instruments that save peoples lives you dont really feel like you are really doing anything yourself to save lives. When he said they would have an annual party and have patients that have been saved by the medical instruments come and share their personal stories I think that is awesome. I think it shows the engineers that they are really saving lives and hearing patient stories can be very touching and give them the engineers that boost of joy knowing they are helping someone in need.,4
660,It was a  great reminder of how different types of service industries do have a significant impact to guests happiness instead of focusing on daily tasks. I found the information very accurate and helpful. It is difficult to stay focus and understanding of guest needs and this pod cast helped me to focus on providing quality service while completing the basic formalities of my job.Technical Remarks:It was easy to understand and I had no problems.,5
660,"I think the ""Task Significance"" that I listened basically refers to the strategies and manners that managers should be aware of to increase employee's productivity and human relation in workplace. As Adam points out that when employees are feeling happier at their work place, they are actually more productive. To make employees feel good at workplace, managers should educate their employees that what they are doing would benefit a lot people and the company as a whole. Managers should make the workers feel working is not just for money, but also contribution to the society, which would motivate more happy employees to work harder.",5
660,"I never really knew the importance or even what is exactly meant by task significance, but after listening to this podcast, it is evident that it plays a great role in the work place. It shows how managers can motivate their employees to work harder and more efficiently, benefitting the company. If the employees feel valued and a sense of accomplishment, they will work harder for the business. They feel a more real life result as to where their work matters, instead of just working day in day out for a paycheck. Task significance seems to be a key point all managers should consider in any business to promote happy harder working employees.",4
660,"This is an informative podcast about job satisfaction beyond its monetary value. Based on Adam’s comment, task significant plays a big role in running a successful business. Task significant helps employees become more engaged in their work and gives them greater job satisfaction beyond money.",4
660,I felt that the podcast on task significance was very well done and easy to understand.  I felt that is interesting that be that have task significance in there job are more satified with their job.  Also that task significance is a major factor in todays workforce.,5
660,"I'm finding this topic very interesting and thought-revoking.Actually, Many people are losing sight of how their jobs make a difference for others after daily routine. The author makes a very constructive suggestion to introduce the employees directly to the people who are benefiting from their work. By doing this, it can make employees realize their job significance and therefore improve job satisfaction. Most importantly, It can further bring the motivation back to their seemingly boring job and make a difference for them as well.",5
660,"Adam Grant expressed the significance of task performance. Using a ""hands on approach"" in showing that employees do in fact have an impact in their work by sharing success stories and how it corresponds to employee work performance. Motivation seems to be the key element, when jobs are tedious and repetitive employees tend to fall out of touch with the soul purpose of their work. The love for one's work in helping others needs positive reinforcement to continue to prove that their jobs are essential, especially to others.",4
660,"I thought the interview with Adam Grant was very educational to anyone apart of the workforce.  Honestly, I never thought about the power of task significance and that it would have such an impact on employees and the level of their performance.  I've always known that what ever occupation I choose would be to in someway help someone else.  However, I never thought after say, many years of doing the same thing without direct appericiation, could alter my motivation to do the best at my job.  It makes sence that if your needed or appericated everyday it would be easy and rewading to do your job.  With that said, task significance is one the most important aspects in a career choice, especially to those that want the rewards of helping others.  It's funny how something as little as seeing or talking to one person who was positively influenced by your efforts would give you the motivation to do better at your job and the way you value your life.  All of Adam's examples from lifeguards to Microsoft employees, all had positive responces without bonuses or time off.  Overall I thought this was a great interview to listen to because of its simplisity, and postive message.",4
660,"This podcast discussed some great solutions to increase productivity in the workplace. Task Significance seems to be a great idea that should be implemented in all companies. Just feeling comfortable in your job and feeling that what you are doing makes a difference to other really makes the employees to WANT to help others.

Great information!",4
660,Adam Grant explains the effects of task significance on job performance and he says that it is doing work that has a positive impact on the well-being of other people. It could be helping co-workers or benefiting customers. I think it is a great way of making a difference and doing good. The important thing is to see the impact that task significance has on people. People whose jobs include task significance tend to be satisfied with their jobs and motivateds with their work. I believe it is a great concept to work on.,5
660,"This is a great podcast news way of thinking to inform managers flourish in their business. 
Because of the economic recession caused the unemployment rate increaase significantly, managers can now form to improve the productivity of workers. We hope that this act has played a catalytic role in the industry employment and productivity.",3
660,"After listening to the Podcast on Task Significance, what I found essential was that within any job organization people are willing to help each other instead of just specializing in their single task. It can be quite boring if an employee works on a single job over and over again. Eventually at some point we will get used to the repetition with our tasks. According to Adam Grant, jobs that are high in task significance involve having a positive impact on health and safety of others, building relationships, make social contributions, make others happier, and educating people. As mentioned by Grant, the bottom line for managers is that we often tend to assume employees are self-interested and try to give jobs that will benefit themselves, maximize pay, make the work interesting, give a chance to be promoted, give a chance to learn and develop. For example, I used to work at an architectural firm where the boss assigned me the role of helping the Human Resource director. Then as I started becoming familiar with the job functions at the front desk, managers in different departments provided me greater challenges so I can rotate among several jobs when needed. As a matter of fact, my company did what Grant has mentioned above by giving me a chance to learn and develop. Indeed, task significance has an impact on motivation because it inspired me to be efficient in various job tasks.",4
660,"After listening to the task significance podcast I learned a few interesting things. People naturally want to help one another out and by seeing the direct affects of their job on someone else employees seem to be happier. A prime example is the life guard example given in the podcast. They wanted to become a life guard to help and save people, but in reality most of them just sit around and do tedious work. Since they were just sitting and doing a tedious job many didn't like it. So if you tell them stories about how life guards jobs are so significant and how they save people lives then they become highly motivated. So in order to make workers be happy and feel like their work matters you must introduce to them what they are doing in the larger picture. How it will help the final consumer.",5
660,"Task significance
After I listened to the pod cast of “task significance”, I realized how it is important to motivate employee themselves. However, like Adam said, task significance are shown by seeing their work effect to social, customer, and they are different depends on what kinds job, and type of person. I personally would motivate if I have to make some decision on my job. For my type of people, I suggest the company’s authority is decentralized. The manager really should need to give their employee right level of task significance.",5
660,"This is a good material about task significance because I'd always knew that loving your job and finding the meaning of it can motivate you to work harder and work better, but I did not know that different task significance can affect different groups of people.  Also, it is true that having task significance can improve better managment.  For example, if my manager cares about us employees more about our feelings and thoughts towards issues that we have, maybe we will work harder and care more about our job because we find that by working harder will benefit our manager and by benefiting him, it will also benefit us.  I learned alot from this, if I was to ever become a manager, I will definitely use the task significance strategy to manage my store and to help my employees find their task significance so they can work harder.  Thank you for this interesting information about management.",4
660,"I think this PodCast was really interesting. I understand this concept of Task Significance and how it can be a motivation for employees. I think it's really important for everyone to understand their Task Significance so they will feel truly happy to be performing their job and of knowing they make a difference. It seems like it would really motivate people and help them be more productive, while also feeling a sense of belonging and accomplishment for their work.",4
660,"I think the Podcast is pretty interesting. It is totally true that task significance makes a big difference in employees. Putting myself as an example, a lot of times I go to work,  all I can think is that I want to go home right away because some days I just don't find any motivation to be at work. However, other days I really enjoy being at work because I can see how customers and coworkers appreciate my work, and it Just feels very nice to see that what you do has a positive impact in other people. I think it is very important that managers understand that having excellent employees has a lot to do with task significance. Employees always need to know that their work makes a difference and it is appreciated by others in other with be motivated at work.  when employees Know that what they do affects others in a positive way , they feel important because they feel their job is worth it; as a result, they perform better.",5
660,It is an interesting material. It introduced how a employee could be motivated.At first I did not imagine that the desiner can be connected with customer.,5
660,"This podcast help me to understand what task signigicant is and how it affect to employee under management. Taks significant is strongly related with worker's motivation. 
Company need to provide their employees better opportunities to have good motivation to work for their job by task significant.
It makes their employees be more motivated to help their co-workers and make them be more productive",4
660,I think that this podcast about Task Significance was very true. Many people aren't able to see the outcome of what they've helped with. I personally work at a company where we help people who have no way of getting around commute but we never get to really meet the people or see the difference we make.,4
660,"Task significance is very interesting because it is important to know which people care about others and it is true this motivate people to exercise any work with a positive action.  Also it makes a difference in people's lives.
the author makes this audio very easy to follow due to the examples.  Workers feel a positive impact when they are in contact with beneficiaries as a result a the dedication in their assigments and a good relationships as meaning and motivation.",5
660,"TasK Significant Material is very interesting how the guest analisys the work area and how it affects positively or negatively to the workers. How powerful is the task significant because it is related with Motivation. Being motived workers are able to help others, make other happy and the business can ran smoothly. Customers can perceive the good environment and everybody gives their 100% during work hours. Task significant very meaningful concept inside an industry, organization or school.Technical Remarks:the sound is very clear and loud.",5
660,"This audio is very helpful for me to understand how important the task significance is to people. It can help people increase their working enthusiam and it can also improve their working efficiency. So companies should try to let their employees realize their task significance, then they will work harder. It is both good for the company and the employee. For employees themselves, they should try to find out their task significance, it will help them to performance better.",5
660,"Task significance is used to highly motivate employees, with a re-enforced attitude that their work really does make a difference in the consumer mind.  My favorite study was of Volvo employees who heard stories from consumers regarding the safety features which were installed and used to save their lives in horrific accidents.  Reading these feedbacks, the employees felt appreciated and knew that their job was making a difference, which later showed higher motivation and persistence in their daily duties.  Managers find it very useful to use task signifance to make the employees feel gratified by helping others.  The goal is make them realize that yes, they're job does make a difference in the world. In a few of my past jobs, there has been an extreme case of Task signifiance, so I too realize the benefit of applying this tactic in the workplaceTechnical Remarks:great podcast!",5
660,"I think that Adam Grant's Task Significance is a highly valuable study which yields some important actionable results. Increasing task significance is clearly integral to increasing worker's performance and motivation. I especially like Grant's study's future implications which recommended that organizations connect their workers to their work's social benefits. Personally engaged in a data entry position at a charitable NPO, I often feel disconnected from my work's social benefits. This study has revealed that I am not alone in my motivational deficit at my job.Technical Remarks:The podcast stream was smooth and worked well.",4
660,"When Adam Grant talks about task significant and aplied to the business world, i think it helped me understand more about how this topic could help a company to better their task. When a company provide the right benefits to their employees, they more willing to be motivated to help their co-workers and being more productive.",5
660,"I agree with this podcast. Task significance makes employees increase motivation and productivity. High task gives workers to satisfaction and increase not only motivation and but also responsibility. For these reasons, I think task significance is interesting to make business effective.",4
660,"I totally agree with this podcast. For employees to see that what they do actually makes a difference, definitely improves productivity. Task significance should be emphasized in places where young adults work, such as fast food places. Many of them don't take what they do seriously, and if they see that their work is more than just a job then there is more efficiency.",5
660,"That was a pretty interesting podcast. I guess motivating employees with whom they will effect is a great motivational approach. I currently work with customer service, and everytime I get compliments I tend to work a bit harder to please the next customer. Positive feedback usually results in positive results in most cases.",4
660,"Task Significance is an interesting topic that Adam Grant pointed out in his paper, ""Task Significance on Job Performance"". Although, I have never heard about this topic before, in a perspective of a consumer, I realize how thankful I am for those that make a difference in my life by using their products or services. When the employees realize their work benefits or help other people in some ways, they’re happier to do so and that’s also the motivation to being productive and effective in their work. Looking around, we can see all kind of jobs that have a certain level of task significance.",4
660,"I found this podcast very interesting.  Although I was familiar with the concept of Task Significance, it was very informative to hear a detailed explanation of the concepts from someone who is an expert on the topic.  Adam Grant explicates the information within his knowledge-base very well, as he portrays the definition of Task Significance to the listener.  The most important points of Task Significance are those within the concept of making employees aware of their impact on society, and other individuals.  Specifically, Adam Grant suggests connecting employees to the customers or people who ""benefit from their work,"" ie connecting someone who builds a car directly to someone who is a customer for that particular car company.  Task Significance is very important for making employees feel as if they are making a large difference, it increases motivation, which in turn increases productivity.",4
660,"After listening to Adam Grant about task significant, it was simply said. As his definition of task significant is ""having an opportunity to do work that has a positive impact for the well being people."" I definitely understand what Adam Grant's bottom line of his paper is and how task significant can help a company or any work task. His point on ""invisible task sign"", where the employee with an high task significant, they are disconnected from others because they do not meet the people. As a hospitality management student, I am really glad to see general managers come outside their office and go around the hotel and greet each department.

As for myself working in retail and most of the time in the fitting rooms, I love seeing people be satisfied on what clothes I bring them. Seeing people comment on how they like the jeans or top makes my job enjoyable, because the customer is happy. And Adam Grants idea is truly right in my case. Seeing what my job does for other makes my job enjoyable and motivates me to continue to do what I do. As for people that do not have much passion within their job task, I believe it would be the managers job to keep them motivated and show them how their job is touching other peoples lives.",5
660,"I found this podcast very interesting, before listening to this podcast I had never heard about the concept of task significance. The concept makes sense, I think people will perform better with knowledge of the importance of their job.",4
660,"This is also my first time to heard about task significant. For me, I think the task significant is pretty much the same theory about getting your master degree. If you want to start your master degree, you probably have to have 1 to 2 years working experience in order to apply for school. This process helps people to avoid getting less interest when it is only focus the theory at school.",4
660,"It is the first time I have heard of Task Significance. I agree that people would like to know that they are making difference. This is especially true for people who have worked the same jobs or duties over years, because works become boring tasks after dealing with the same issue days by days, and the Task Significance helps to show everybody how their efforts influences each other and the company. I think Task Significance is a good idea because it shares each others' thoughts and it helps motivating employee’s interests to work.",5
660,"this podcast told me the importance of "" Task Significance"" which i didn't know before and i found out that i am kind of a worker who doesn't have ""task significance"" at my workplace. If the manager are to comes up with this kind of concept, they should know what task significance and they should implement this idea into their routine. it is really a great opportunity for the manager to come up with the workers who are self-motivated and they have direct contact with the person who they are serving. it can build up relationship between people and they can help out one another. it would be great if everyone can be able to work under this kind concept and i would like to see myself in it too. The main reasons for people to work can be either they enjoy their work or they need to work in order to survive and i think working should have some kind of meaning for us so we can do the best in whatever we are doing.",4
660,"It is first time I have heard about Task Significance. It's very informative and is good for any organization to help other in their work force. Like they said, people are self-interesting, and they will like to know how they did and they are making the difference for other people with their work. Especially for people work for the same thing long time, it’s easy to lost interest in their job. Task significance is good idea to motivate them. Also People have more chance to talk to each other, share the experience, had more chance to learn and to help. For me, I will like to work more if my work is high in task significance.",4
660,Task significance has the potential to make a huge impact on work performance- no matter what the industry.  This podcast was very insightfull in that the guest provided simple yet powerful examples of present day companies using task significance as way to motivate and inspire  their employees.,4
660,"After listening to Mark Adam speak on Task Significance and it's importance to a companies reputatio, internally and externally, I have.  I have come to an understanding of the difference each and every individual has on others. Working for a Hotel industry at the front desk can seem to be an everyday routine- answering the same questions, knowing the hotels layout, and checking in and out consistantly for 8 hours a day. My managers use the task significance strategy to movtivate myself and my colleagues. We all make a diiference even if we don't realize it. By showing someone who does not know where to go to dine and have a good time, I have made an impact on the individual who is asking as well as his/her perception of the city his/her is visiting. It is certainly a ripple effect, if low motivation and the mind set of ""doing the same routine over and over again"" is in effect then it will certainly show through the turn over % leading to high costs and a sour note on the company. By using concrete examples like Adam mentioned on real life stories of life guards saving people or Medtronics patients miracles one can certainly find a meaning for their purpose with the company and themselves. People want recognition and want to make a difference, by analyzing what they do and to whom it effects can increase their significance in their lives.",5
660,"I've never heard of Task Significance before I heard this podcast. But after listening to Adam Grant talk about what it is and how it is used in the work place, I was able to understand how important task significance is in the working environment. I believe that all managers should take Grant's ideas into consideration, such as the interventions that he discussed. If it worked for those employees to work harder in benefiting other people, then it should be shown to those employees who only work for self-interest.",4
660,"Adam Grant’s research on “Task Significance” is exceptional! If managers are able to understand and implement this concept into their daily practices, they will be sure to see an increase in performance efficiency and overall effectiveness. Business researchers are constantly in search for innovative methods for increasing work productivity. “Task Significance” is a very practical concept that has the potential to significantly improve performance in the workplace. 

The concept of “Task Significance” allows under-performing individuals to develop a fuel for self-motivation. It gives them a sense of purpose and allows them to perform to the fullest extent of their capabilities. 

Great listen!",5
660,I was so surprised when I was listening this podcast about task significance since it was my first time to know such a thing. This podcast has made me to understand how powerful task significance is. I think it is definitely important that people know the efforts they made are actually helpful and beneficial for others for motivation in works. The examples that Adam Grant uses during podcast like lifeguards is lively and easy to see how people can have motivation to work even harder than ever by just knowing the efforts they and the ones who have the same career as them made are recognized by others. I hope the importance of task significance could be recognized by more people since it would definitely bring great efficiency in works.,4
660,"I think task significance is a very simple concept and a high motivation tool for employees. Although the concept is not new, especially in industry's such a public service. Policemen for example would say the reason for pursuing their career was to help others. I do think that task significance should be highly pushed throughout organizations and it shows a dimension not ordinarily seen by employees to provide an uplift or eye opening view to motivate them.",4
660,"The idea of task significance was something that I hadn't heard of before. When I think of a job that has a large social impact, I usually think of doctors, teachers, or fire fighters. But I thought Adam Grant made a good point by broadening the definition to include jobs such as call centers and pool lifeguards. It is definitely important to remember this as a manager in the future. People want to feel that they are doing something meaningful and helpful to society. It makes sense that if you feel like you are making a difference, you will work harder and be more motivated.",4
660,"Task significance depends on the person and job. All people would love to be recognized for their efforts. But on the other hand you should know you did something good for another person, and you shouldn't have to be reminded. Yeah, its a great way to motivate people but you should do things because you want to, not because you have to.",4
660,"Task Significance is good for any organization to help others in their work force.  Employees have to work with others to make the business better and their communication.  In the hospitality industry, all the departments in the hotel have to work together to make sure the hotel is working smoothly.  If employees don't help one another or communicate with the other departments it would be a big mess and many unsatisfied customers.  Task significance takes an affect in motivation in the work place because they influence employees to talk to each other and be able to work together.  This way the employees are not just their co-workers, they can be friends that would like to help each other.",4
660,"The idea of Task Significance is very interesting. I never heard of task significance before but the concept of task significance make a lot of sense. I do believe that people work for a job which high in task significance has higher motive and productive to their work. So, it is important for the employer to build a working environment with high task significance for their employee. Let the employees know they are making a difference for the other people with their work. Working is much more meaningful for the workers if they know they are helping other people other than just for money. I think I will enjoy work more if my job is high in task significance.",4
660,"I found the podcast titled ""Task Significance"" to be excellent advice for managers and future managers.  I am currently in the process of building an organization that is bringing together the lesbian community of California.  Whenever I need a specific job done I always try to make sure that I let the person know how important what they are doing is to the final goal of the company, even if it is just the simplest task.  They understand that what they are doing and contributing to the project is important, this gives them self satisfaction and something to be proud of in the end.   Ultimately this makes them work harder and stay loyal.  People that work with my organization always have a tie to the community that we work with because I have found that they will work with there heart and this achieves incredible things.  It is always important to to keep employees motivated by reminding them of how important they are to the company, remind them of their Task Significance.

Everyone wants to feel as if what they are doing at work is important, I enjoyed this podcast because it explains how crucial it is to always keep Task Significance in mind.",4
660,"Based on Adam Grant’s Task Significance

I strongly agree with Adam Grant’s concept of task significance and its significance.
While it is true that most employees are self-interested, it is also important to note that most human beings by nature are highly relational wanting to make a positive impact on others’ lives. By doing so, they want to define the meaning and purpose of their existence. 
It is not a mystery that people with higher task significance often have a higher job performance and higher job satisfaction. High task significance also explains the reason why priests, nurses, teachers, and dentists often express high job satisfaction. Relative to other workers of different occupations, these workers have a privilege to work closely with their students or patients and witness their work directly making a positive impact on the lives of the students and patients. 

Ultimately, every employees have desire to be known and appreciated by others through their good works regardless of their age or background. For that reason, it is a manager’s duty to appreciate and recognize each of her employees and their works and remind of the difference they are making in the world.",5
660,"I thought the Podcast on ""Task Significance"" by Mark Adam was very informative. Starting a new job is very exciting for many people. But as time goes on, these people start to lose interest in their job and forget why they ever wanted these jobs. Yet, by getting employees interested in their jobs again, motivation in the workplace increased dramatically. For any business to be successful, businesses must remember to keep their employees satisfied with their jobs. If an employee does not approve of a business, then how can a customer approve of that same business?",4
660,"I do agree with the conversation. Although monetary incented is very important for employees, respects and self-esteem are also crucial parts of workers’ satisfaction. I think these factors are more important in my carrier life than money. They are so significant to employees because they can build up one’s confidence and self-motivation. As long as employees are happy with their jobs, they tend to work better; therefore, the productivity will be improved naturally. So I do believe that as worker’s satisfaction increases, the working efficiency/productivity will increase as well. And this is a significant balanced point between a corporation and employees.",5
660,"The idea that people will be more motivated and therefore perform their jobs better seems kind of obvious – I just never knew that there was an entire area of research and study devoted to this issue.  Although the concept presented in this podcast isn't new to me, I have never heard the term ""task significance"" before, so I definitely learned something new.  

Most of my life, I've been involved in various kinds of volunteering activities. Because volunteers don't get paid, motivation is really a key factor, so I think the concept of task significance can be especially important for people who manage/coordinate volunteers as well as for the volunteers themselves.  When you don't get paid for the job, it's especially easy to get discouraged, so one has to be constantly reminded of ""the sense that one's job has a positive impact on the wellbeing of other people"" – i.e. of your task significance.

I can't think of a more difficult and thankless job than soliciting money from people on the phone – even if it is for a good cause (like in the example Grant used in the podcast, or for charitable organizations etc.) – so introducing the people who are making those calls to the people who actually benefit from the money they raise seems like a great idea.  Unlike paid telemarketers, callers who are trying to raise funds for charitable organizations or causes are most often unpaid volunteers, so they really need the motivation and a strong sense that they're making a difference (have high task significance), otherwise they are bound to get discouraged.

However, while it might be easy to point out the task significance for jobs like fundraising, firefighters, nurses, teachers etc., it might be more difficult to come up with high task significance examples for factory workers on an assembly line (esp. those working for Ford or GM…). I wonder what types of ""intervention"" Grant would suggest for them?",4
660,"I agree with Assistant Professor Grant’s opinion about the dramatic effect of task significance on job performance.  “Task Significance” is a kind of thinking about how his/her job is; a kind of satisfaction that every employee gets from his/her job; a kind of mental health that his/her job has a positive impact on the wellbeing of other people.  The role of mental functions in individual is very important.  It makes the direction of people’s behaviors.  For example, between authors and readers, they don’t know each other even they never see each other forever, if the author believes that his book encourages reader to face the difficulties in life, the author will improve his performance in writing.  As the same reason, when employees believes that their jobs really useful and help other people, they will get satisfaction from their jobs, and then have more energy on job performance.  It makes jobs be more effective.",5
660,I agree with the fact that task orientated positions knowing that your making a difference does help employers. I do not believe that all employers are selfish and when they know they are making a difference then they will be more motivated because they are looking at the bigger picture,4
660,"I really liked the interview that was presented over the podcast. I thought that the researchers information and studies were very interesting. A lot of the examples that were used could be related to on many levels. I think the case with the Microsoft employees brought up a good point. The people who are designing these great electronics don't always realize where people's mistakes come from because the designers themselves are so in depth with the machine that they understand the way it works. I guess it is easy to lose focus and remember that the every day consumer won't understand or doesn't necessarily want to understand how the computer works, just simply that it can do what they want it to do. By putting the designers in an observation room and getting a chance to observe the every day user would be really good and beneficial.
I also thought the lifeguard story was kind of funny, because it does in a way seem like one of those jobs that you would go into it hoping to save lives and really make a difference, kind of like fire fighters or police officers; just on a smaller scale. I guess the disappointment of realizing how much more paper work you have to do for the amount of time you are actually in the water or providing a service doesn't really pan out. And in the end if you were to have so much constructive energy just constantly going through you chances of becoming burnt out are really high.",4
660,"This was a very interesting podcast on task significance because it changed my view on some of the daily tasks completed by others everyday. I used to believe that most workers do work just for the wages and salaries, but now I understand that a majority of them put people in first priority. The several jobs that Adam Grant mentioned: Fireman, lifeguard, travel guide maker, automobile engineers all served as excellent examples of jobs that have a significant impact on others. 16 minutes of listening to this podcast totally changed the way I view about the world, very impressive!",5
660,"I like this conversation very much.I have never think about who made travel guide or map when I use them. The people who made these guide may never see the users. But their jobs are significant for us. They do not ask us to pay back when they make the guide. They never think about it. It let me think what is my job's significant. I always think my job is boring. Pick up the phone, answer the question that people ask from the phone. Now I think my job is significant. I can help people solve their problem by phone. My job is effective. It's a wonderful thing. I will motivate myself all the time.",4
660,"I found this podcast very interesting, especially what Adam Grant had to say about task significance. His story about his first job as a lifeguard was interesting.. how he never had to do anything. I despise jobs where I just sit there and do nothing. Sometimes it's good to do nothing and get paid, but other hand, I want to feel like I'm being paid to complete tasks. When I have a job, I want to feel like they hired me for a reason.",4
660,i have never heard of task significance before and the pod cast has open up my mind and realize the effetive outcomes it offers. i will use this method to movitivate myself and my coworkers!,4
660,"Adam Grant sounds very knowledgable about his thoughts on Task Significance.  He is right when he mentions that some people in the work force sometimes are disconnected with the impact that they may have on what they do.  Workers may be blind by the benefits they offer to those they help everyday.  He explains that task significance is the opportunity where you do work that brings a positive outlook, well being of others.  You have the chance to make a difference, a social contribution.  For some people, the more meaningful a job may be, the more satisfying a person can be about their job.  Sometimes employees may be self interested, waiting for raises or expecting an easy job and getting paid for it.  A lot of companies try to please their employees to increase their task significance but sometimes others are too blind to see the positive sides.  

i.e. doctors are the ones who create vaccines to save peoples lives, but never have the chance to meet their patients.  

For a lot of people, it is very easy to lose sight of the impact that you might be putting on someone.",4
660,"Good podcast.  It's easy for an employee to lose sight of the significance of their job when it requires repetition.  This is a good tool to use if you are in management.  Also, it is a change of perspective if you are an employee.",4
660,"I had never heard of the phrase ""task significance"" prior to this podcast, and found it very motivating and encouraging. The general assumption of society-serving-industries is that they're run by saintly all-givers or bored-millionaires: it made careers founded on societal welfare seem unattainable to the common-person. By enabling a personal connection between employees in EVERY industry to their benefactors gives purpose or a sense of meaning to what could otherwise be a tedious routine. That idea -- task management -- is what makes employees enjoy their labor. Just as the speaker, Adam, said, it statistically increased motivation in the workplace: from even such varying industries as lifeguarding to telemarketers. I like how at the end the podcast tied in with our textbook in addressing the dilemma of which goal to pursue: one of an individualist approach, or one of task management. Adam, as well as our text, say that in small businesses an individualist approach is theoretically supposed to produce the most moral long-term goals; however, Adam goes on to say that maybe we focus too highly on on the self-interest scope... That maybe we should concern ourselves with how much we help and affect others... That task management allows us to find personal reward behind our work.",5
660,"I thought the podcast was great. The topic that was covered, task significance, was a very important idea that needs to be used in the workplace. I have two jobs right now and one of them i stay motivated since i am seeing what i effect i have on children (I work at a summer camp). The other job is a bit more challenging to stay motivated since i do not see as much praise or response for the work i do (catering). I think managers need to take the time to maintain motivation in their work place.",4
660,"Dr. Adam Grant's research ""Task Significance"" is one of the management skills.  In order to increase job performance, some managers try to use a different way of communication with their subordinates, just like solicitors selling their commodities; convincing customers that "" I am not selling a product to you, instead; you need my product.""  This is an effective skill of communication to motivate individual employee's commitment and make his monotonous job in difference. As a result, when an employee has a passion on his job, the productivity is definitely increased.  Besides, when a consideration is a main factor to motivate an employee working hard, making the job in difference is another motivation, for example, a police officer patrols his route everyday, it is a boring daily routine mission.  But when he has a passion to safeguard his responsible area without a crime, he would pay more attention on observing any suspect on the same route .",5
660,"I had never heard of Task Significance before listening to the pod cast with Adam Grant. It makes so much sense to introduce employees to the people whom their jobs positively affect. I am a hospitality management major and I think that one reason why people chose this as a career is because there is a great amount of task significance involved. If you work at the front desk of a hotel and give someone an upgrade you see first hand how happy it makes him or her. Same goes with working in the food service industry, if a guest asks for something special and you are able to provide it for them, then they are more likely to return. I loved the example of the party Medtronic held for its engineers. How could you not feel great about what you did for a living after a person who was once paralyzed starts doing cartwheels in front of you. I agree that being able to see the direct benefits your work has on the lives of other is a great motivating tool.",5
660,"Task Significance is a great concept, employees are shown that their work is not solely for a pay check. This concept also benefits the organization through increased productivity and is achieved with virtually no cost.",4
660,"The podcast helps bring out a message that high task significance is not only important to people's life but also the value to themselves. People tend to work harder and happier when they realize that their works can really make a difference. Example of lifeguard from Adam Grant impresses me because I have never thought about why some lifeguards like to work with such long hours and not so high pay, but now I realize that money is not the only first consideration to people while they choose their jobs but the feeling of satisfaction.",4
660,"I really think that was a helpful podcast tool that helped explain certain details on how a business should run. I first like to say this was my first podcast and is a very helpful tool of technology to make lives more convenient and still be able to spread the information out quick. Task significance to me is a opportunity for people to help others and actually have an impact on the work they do. Although they do not necessarily always see eye to eye, being able to increase motivation and productivity within your company says a lot about this theory. Great podcast and would like to hear more of your stuff.",5
660,"I also agree with these comments and theories made in this podcast. I personally have experienced the importance of task significance in my work as a recruiter. In cases where I am closely involved with my client organization, I am much more motivated to work on their project versus others who I don´t have as much face to face time with. Talking with my client frequently and meeting with them face to face helps me see who I am helping with my work, and makes me work harder to make them happy. Very interesting theories and ideas!",4
660,"Adam Grant had pointed out some facts to me that I have never thought about. There are jobs that are people are doing which helps other people without knowing, for example authors and readers, the authors never meet all their readers. They do not know how much their effort and work can affect a person. Also, I found Mr. Grant and I have one thing similarly, life guarding. I use to be a lifeguard and I totally agree with him, you rarely need to jump in to perform any savings. I worked as a lifeguard for almost 3 years and I have never read a story about how important my job was, now I am hearing how my work would effect people, I probably would have stayed and worked longer with job satisfaction.",5
660,"I agree 100% with Mark Adam about his podcast on ""Task Significance"".  Without having to see the success of the people who have benefited from a management's work, the company or organization cannot grow.  I really like his examples and studies on his different interventions on the companies he has researched.  For example, his Microsoft story: I definitely was picturing the Vista software for Windows and how non-user-friendly it was.  But once developers were able to see and recognize that the people who have rated the software as ""difficult"" and ""challenging"" were not ""idiots"", they were able to change and fix the problems the majority of the users were experiencing.  By doing this, it not only helped the users and their product, but it also helped with the developers task significance.",5
660,"The Podcast for this course was very informative and it helped me understand better the concepts of task significance. I didn't realize there was such a term until listening to the podcast. Task significance builds relationships, morale, and purpose for employees who work in a corporate or small business environment. I can honestly say that by utilizing the fundamental aspects of task significance, companies have a greater chance in succeeding not only in profit, but in customer and employee satisfaction.Technical Remarks:I didn't have any technical difficulties when I was listening to the podcast discussion. It was very clear in terms of audio capability.",4
660,"After listening to the Podcast, I thought Adam Grant mention several interesting facts & effects of Task Significance. I didn't realize how much an effect it can make on workers, just by having high task significance. It does make sense to be motivated at work by being provided with positive benefits of customer experiences. I think the feeling of satisfaction is normal, and of course, people would like to work in a place where they can make a differences/contribution, that is why Task Significance is crucial in management.",4
660,"After the podcast, I felt that it was very helpful and educated.  Interestingly, I've learn that high task significance is important in order to build relationships, be beneficial, productive, more responsive and meaningful. On the other hand, lack task significance will effect motivation. Overall, this is very true since I am currently working in a corporation, bad management can higher effect employees motivation to make a difference in their task as well as being productive.",5
660,"This podcast was very inspiring because it is very important factor in business.  It gave me an idea of the value of a task.  Even if its a low paying and not desirable job, it can be meaningful and beneficial to others.  Also high task significant gives more satisfactions to works which leads to higher motivation and higher production.",5
660,"I thought Adam Grant's study of task significance was great.

 Just earlier today i was trying to figure out why i do not enjoy my very easy job that doesn't demand too much of my time or critical thinking skills. This podcast answer my question! It's because at my current job i don't feel ""powerful"", I don't feel like anything i do makes a difference. I make several phone calls to potential customers through out the day, but once the call is made and an appointment is scheduled, other employees are the ones that are to follow up with the potential costumer and provide them with direct service that may affect their lives greatly. One might say that my position is what starts the whole process, and with out me  these potential customers may have never become customers. However since i don't have contact other than a brief phone conversation or even updates on customers who i brought it in, it makes me feel like my job task is not important to the company nor the customer, when really it  is.

Being an example of an employee with a job that has no task significance makes me realize what i need in order to fulfill my happiness at work. I am a very carrying person who would like to make a difference in a persons life, therefore i should place myself in a job position where i can see the results of my effort and hard work on the job.

Management should focus on making sure their employees see the results of their work. Daily, weekly, or even monthly meetings can be used with stories, updates, and reports of services the company provides and how they are effecting their customer in order to rally up the employees and get them motivated to do the best they can in their job position. 

As mentioned in an example by Adam Grant, a call center has a 350% annual turnover. Turnover rates this high are not good for a company, the hiring process and job training becomes a large expense for a company. If they are able to show their current employees the impact they are having on the company's customers they would most likely want to stick around and keep contributing as an employee which would greatly benefit the firm by saving them money.

Management needs to make sure it's employees feel valued and needed, showing task significance is a great way to do so.",5
660,"Adam Grant’s experiment clearly proves just how important it is for people to see the purpose of their work and how their jobs have positive effects on society.  For some people, they might feel that the work they are doing is not really helping and it is the same no matter how much effort they put in.  Then they would be unmotivated and feel no incentive to put in extra effort.  However, when they see that their job can make a difference if they do it well then they would want to give in extra effort.  I believe people in general want to feel that they are useful to society.  This is especially true for people in the industries that were mentioned in the video; life guards, medical science, safety engineers, etc, because many of these people went into these careers wanting to make a positive contribution and to help people.  If they feel that the job they are doing isn’t really helping then they would lose focus of the purpose and feel useless and have lower morale.  When they are reminded of how important their job is and have a more personal connection with the contribution they make, then they will be able to stay motivated.",5
660,"Adam Grant's concept of Task Significance very impresses me because it very inspires and educates people at their careers. Grant's speech helps me become more understanding what the task significant is and how employees well performance it. In the meant time, i want to show my great respect to those people (lifeguards, cured vaccine medical scientists, scholarship callers, Microsoft engineers, bathroom or street cleaners or patrolmen, etc) who have contributed their whole life, passion, and well-being to the people or community may have never received any credit from the clients or patients.",5
660,"This podcast brought up a very important part of a business. How is the company or it's employees able to benefit the stakeholders? In professions like firefighters and life guards, almost everything that these people do is to help others. They could be risking their own lives while doing their jobs, but they feel good about it. They don't go to work everyday hoping to get home early or doing as little work as possible. They go into it 110% everyday. But do I think all companies and large corporations are like this? Absolutely not! Some companies exist because they want to make money and gain power. There will be many great companies that help the environment and society, and there will be ones that exist to destroy our world. I feel that if you work for one of these bad corporations, you contribute to the destruction of society. Often times,the company you work for reflects your own personality.",4
660,"I found this to be interesting and educating at the same time.  The premise is people can benefit others in other ways just than the job itself.  People that are satisfied with their job tend to be more motivated. When employees are aware on the task they are doing and how it is affecting others, it will enhance how they work.  He gave great specific details on how Task Management helps people not only individually, but as a whole as well.  In order to be obtain true success, people must be motivated and feel part of a team.",4
660,I thought that this podcast on Task Significance was very interesting. It's interesting to hear that improving the knowledge of task significance has an immense impact on how people work. It's great that Adam figured out a pretty easy way to motivate people in the jobs their already doing by showing them how they are helping people.,4
660,"I really liked this podcast because I have never seen into this issue. I had always thought that workers are working mainly for the money. Then I thought ""why do some lifeguards work for more than 10 years?"". I think he explained it by telling us that we value what we do in life. The task significance can be the only determinant when choosing jobs. The wages for lifeguards aren't even high, but people who value task significance see more than money. Another example would be the security guards in malls. They are risking their life for the people who shop at the mall. Their pays aren't too much higher than the minimum wage, but they still do it. I think that Adam Grant is right about how task significance plays a big role in the motivation of employees.",5
660,"Adam Grant's findings about task significance in the work place supplement Richard Hackman's and Greg Olman's earlier work very well. I agree with these researchers that task significance is an issue which employers and their employees should discuss on a continuous basis. Although virtually all jobs involve some degree of task significance I am curious as to how task significance can (if possible) be improved upon in the food industry as well as the retail industry (i.e. cashiers, fitting room associates). How does their work contribute to a better society? As an employee of the retail industry (sales associate level) it is very hard to stay motivated. I hope Grant or other grad students continue to explore this issue in terms of demographics.",4
660,"This is interesting how he applies psychology to jobs.  The bottom line is that, if you feel like your job is meaningful then you will take your job more seriously.  My only criticism about these findings is that he uses extreme examples in which the significance is saving lives.  It would be interesting to find out the impact this has on fast food workers.",4
660,"I find this Podcast to be very interesting in the fact that I work in a job setting ful of high task significance and I feel at times the work can be extremely monotanous. In fact, the only time I feel as though what I am doing is not monotanous is when a customer or my manager recognizes my hard work and expresses that to me verbally. Although I feel it is important to have high task significance within a job, I feel that the tasks must be well rewarded in order to keep the employee happy and continously performing the tasks well. The interventions that Adam performed were very crucial to changing some industries that were losing their employee loyalty.",4
660,"I listened to a podcast, and then, I understood that the subject was about how Task Significance influence to job performers. According to the podcast, Task Significances bring a lot of positive impact to people such as workers, customers, and different group of people. For instance, Mark Adam said that people can motivate by task significances, and people satisfy from it. As a result, their job performances improve. I think that task significant is very important idea because sometimes people cannot motivate for their job. Also, task significant may be good degree of how people decide their job.",5
660,"I listened to this podcast about task significance. Adam Grant is very educated and well informed on this subject, and knows how to explain it well. I agree with him that many people do not receive the credit for the tasks that they do. He gave many very good examples of this subject and how task significance is important in businesses.",5
660,"Great, what really struck me was when he spoke about travel guides such as Lonely Planet, and TimeOut because I use them a lot for my travels.  I normally go through several travel guides to find the one that has more graphics, and better details such as cost, directions, and related places to visit.  Just like he said, the writers became disconnected from the reader and what the reader needs.  I notice this when I speed read through these different travel guides.  The ones that do have a better connection show a strong task significance.",4
660,"Interesting how he mentions conscious and unconscious workers.  Also like the examples of Volvo, Microsoft, and Metronics.  I believe this method of using Task Significance can make a major impact to management because it allows the creators and users to have some kind of direct communication and it allows room for managing change and innovation.",4
660,Great podcast for managers to show to their employees in order to motivate employees to work hard to benifit others not just because of salary-- to work hard to benefit themselves and others.,3
660,"I definitely agree that task significance is very important in the work place but I am a little bit confused with how this concept applies to the majority of people that are employed.  For example:  How does a car salesman see himself from the point of ""task significance""?  This individual may sell cars to people that are desperate for a car but the interests of the two parties are conflicting because it is all based on profits for the dealership/salesperson versus lowest possible price for the car buyer.  How does this individual see the outcome of a positive task significance when the two agendas are so completely opposite of one another.  Or how about someone who is responsible for minimizing costs for a company by using economies of scale by utilizing a developing countries lack of leverage.  Low wages that barely get these individuals by are definitely not going to be talked about by this individual but instead the low-cost of the product and his/her bonus/commission is this persons task significance in motivation.  So to end, I beleive their is a task significance and a task insignificance to be considered on the other side of the pendulum.  How would one define this?  Ignorance is bliss or...???  Great idea for certain occupations and industries but hardly for all industries and occupations.",3
660,"Im really impressed with the concept of task significance. Motivation is key for efficiency and task significance is a great way to motivate employees and allow them to see their jobs in a new way. Most people want jobs that make a difference, so task signifance is a great way for them to realize the effect their role in their company has on others. Great idea!",5
660,"This podcast has a great message that informs managers to think about ways to flourish in their respective businesses.  Since the recession has caused the unemployment rate to increaase drastically, managers can now form ways to increase workers' productivity.  Hopefully, this acts as a stimulus in the industry for jobs and productivity.",4
660,"This is an excellent podcast for managers who want to keep their employees motivated.  I think most employees nowadays work for a salary and not for the benefit of others, especially during this economic downturn, so task significance is more important than ever to increase employee productivity.",4
660,"Task significance is an important factor for employees in the work place.  I have been working for more than ten years, and in my experience I do agree that the jobs that were more satisfying were positions that allowed me to connect with the people who I serve.

Although task significance is important in having a satisfying job, getting the right pay for your job helps people feel more satisfied.  Especially is these tough economic times where families are struggling with bills, making enough money at our jobs motivates people to work harder to take care of their financial responsibilities.",4
660,"I love the scholarship example.  For the callers to be more productive in getting scholarship funds, all it took was real peoples stories.  These stories helped the callers to be more motivated because now they new who was benefiting and how they were benefiting.  The work seemed less meaningless when they knew that every penny helped a student attend college.  This is extremely powerful.",5
660,Task significance gives employees motivation to do well in their jobs and therefore help others. I think employees would be more productive; happier and more fulfilled workers = a more productive work force. If there were more jobs that benefited others maybe we would have a happier work force?,4
660,"I agree that task significance can have an effect on motivation and the studies that were presented about the university call center callers and the lifeguards definitely, as well as examples of Volvo and Microsoft, support that claim. For many people it is helpful to see a direct benefit of their efforts in order for them to improve job performance or continue to perform well if they are already doing so. Realizing task significance of a job is like seeing a return on investment, except investment here is not defined in monetary units, but in time and brainpower invested while performing a job with high task significance. However, even though studies that were presented showed that the employees' motivation increased after the task significance was highlighted to them, I do not believe that it works the same for all the people. Although motivation can be generalized for many people along some criteria, it still differs from person to person. Some people really are motivated solely by personal achievement, such as promotions, or financial rewards, such as high salaries and bonuses. For these people, although task significance may still play a role, it does not act as the main driver behind motivation and may not even be significant enough to affect their motivation at all. Still, for many employees it is important to know that their job does something greater than just bring them income and that is why seeing a direct correlation between one's efforts and the benefits that arise from these efforts can be a powerful motivation.",4
660,"Task Significance do play a major role in how an employees performs and value their job.  Having worked in the telecommunications industry for over 7 years, one of the major complaints I hear from talking to people is they don't get any satisfaction from doing their job.  Most of the people I encountered want to have a purpose and do something meaningful as oppose to work just to keep the employees busy.  I too share the same feeling.  Work that challenges the employee and give them a sense of satisfaction such as fixing equipments, resolving issues technical or nontechnical.  People want a sense of belonging.  By providing and creating that sense of belonging and purpose, employees will be more motivated to do their job and do it well.  Good pay will only keep an employee happy for a short period of time.  The job be something an employee is happy doing.  MGMT 405/R. PURSER",4
660,"This significance is very important in the working community. After listening to this podcast, it brought up many good points that I can connect with doing work you find rewarding and work that you want to do. The employees are satisfied because they realize that their job impacts people in a positive way and that what they do makes a difference, and the manager benefits because their department runs more smoothly and has less turnover. This talk is very important because for myself to become more successful and motivated I need to think of how the products and services my job provides actually benefits the customer in my opinion, don't help their employees with this and that can cause workers to not work that hard and in turn, less work is completed. If managers get this idea, I believe workers will be happier to come to work and much more productive.",4
660,"A job with high task significance should be high in recognition. Recognition for one's work could be received directly or indirectly from co-workers, superiors,customers,or outside sources. It could also be positive or negative by being an encouragement or a learning tool.  
People like to know how important they are to the company or what they bring to the company. At the company I work at we this concept called ""Grooves."" All new employees go through Grooves training where they learn how important they are to the company, how they can contribute to the company, and the importance of working with their fellow employees as a team. It's a great motivating and unifying tool. There are also Grooves awards where employees nominate their fellow employees when they recognize a job well done (a fellow employee being ""Groovey""). My point: high recognition may lead to high performance.",4
660,"Excellent topic. Task Significance is very important at the workplace.  Sure when you are doing the same repetitive task each day, you tend to be dissatisfied with your work. By making you see how your work does well with other people, you start to enjoy your work and job performance increases.  I really liked the example of Microsoft where the company tried to motivate their engineers to fix the computer bugs that regular people were having.  BY making them see the users using a one way mirror, the engineers really saw that these ordinary people were really educated people and that motivated them to fix the bugs.  Just by making employees see how their work benefits others could make a big significance on their job performance and attitude.",5
660,"Great interview.  I like the examples that you used in your interview, especially the one that a college doesn't has enough money to offer scholarship.  They ended up forming a call center where they would ask for volunteers to call random peoples up for their donations.  Even if 90% of the calls were being rejected.Technical Remarks:the meaning of ""task significance""",4
660,"After listening to the broadcast, i think team work is very important. however team work is hard to achieve because everyone has different opinions; it requires great coordination. For people in workplaces, I think firms should put more efforts and time as possible to make teams and team memebers to recognize their importance and motivation. in addition, without task significance, people tend to get bored with their routine job and the turnover is very high. therefore, it is important for firms to emphasize task significance",4
660,"The material about task significance is very interesting. I think that people work for living not live for work. People do their job not only for earning more money but also for living in meaningful lives. Knowing that what you do is benefiting others can truly bring motivation to the job you do. But the hard thing is to connect you to the people who you are helping with. That brings a task to managers, which is to reinforce the task significance to the employees. I think the power of people is the first productivity of a corporation. If you can successfully motivate people, it means that the half of the work has already done. To make sure that everyones job is important and respect everyones effort can raise the employees satisfaction about their job, which can ultimately better the quality and efficiency of the job.",4
660,"From listenning a Podcast ""Task Significance with Adam Grant,"" I learned that employees create more productivity and job efficiency when they understand ""Task Significance"". When they learn how much their work is important for others or how much benefit they create to others, their motivation gets higher. This motivation leads more job efficiency and productivity. When people learn they are helping other people with their job, they see their goal more clearly and work harder to accomplish their goal.",5
660,"I think that this method of task significance is very important for people that work in task significant jobs. Jobs that help other people, but one never meets the person that is helped. for example a writer. He writes to benefit the reader, but never actually gets to meet the reader. I agree with the concept that if people that do these types of jobs should get more credit. They should be praised for doing such a good job so that they can be motivated to work harder. Motivation takes a key role in this method of task significance. Without motivation, the worker wont work as hard as if he was motivated for doing a good job. Because these people are important in our society because they are doing hard work, and we should praise them.

660,"I feel that it is very important for managers as well as employees to understand task significance. Not only does it increase personal pride in the work you as an employee are doing, but it increases production and quality of work done. I think that by realizing task significance, you also create a better morale in the working environment. So, if a few people understand that what they do matters to the lives of other people, surrounding employees may also see this and be motivated to do better, purely because good feelings are contagious. I also feel that it connects well with thinking that management should be led with more compassion. Although profit is a great motivator in the business world, it is important to see the value to the benefits from products and services that are being provided.",4
660,"(under new management)(task significance)
I understand the relevance of task significance

660,"In the global economics, the idea of task significance if very important for the company to reduce expense and increase revenue. In addition, the management can gather information from individual empolyee who can be worked at home or student who going to school through the internet. As a result, management have to play a very important role in a project. They have to communicate well with individule employees, assign different work clearly, indicate mistakes correctly.",4
660,"This podcast was inspiring and very educational. I liked how he described task managemnet and how he gave relevent stories supporting his theory. The many years I have worked, task management has not been clearly defined and productivity and self motivation slows down for experienced employees. This talk is very important because for myself to become more successful and motivated I need to think of how the products and services my job provides actually benefits the customer. After knowing that, I can work harder for customers to get what they need so they can become satisfied, and I need to teach my coworkers this theory so everyone will become more motivated. I think all jobs need task management so the customer and workers will all benefit.",5
660,"This was very interesting and extremely useful.  Employee turnover and maintaining production is something all managers deal with, and this is a good technique to implement that is good for not only the manager but the employees as well.  The employees are satisfied because they realize that their job impacts people in a positive way and that what they do makes a difference, and the manager benefits because their department runs more smoothly and has less turnover.",4
660,"What do you think the most significance role of manager? What do you think the hardest role of manager? I think the answer for both questions are the managing employees. Lets assume that there are two different types of employees who are a well managed employee and a normal employee. They must be having different propensity of their job. The one must be more meditative, confident and happy for their job than the other. Like this, depends on the ability of manager, the attitude of employees for their job is completely different.",4
660,"I think this is a good ideal on how many managers can provide a good way to push their employees to work harder. Many employees will worker harder when they feel that their work will be affective or make a difference in others lives. Even if you think of a house wife, she makes no money, but when she see's that her work is making a difference in her children's lives as well as her husband's it sometimes make the job worth while.  ",3
660,"I enjoyed listening the podcast. Adam mentions that we live in day to day routine and easy to forget what we do. I believe every job is so important and helps others to gain satisfaction; however, we forget the fact that we are working (means helping others)to help others. Idea of task significant (positive impact on others) is very important when we are doing our jobs. Overall, I enjoyed learning about it, and made me feel like everyone of us is unique and satisfy others. Enjoy what we do!",4
660,"I heard something like ""Task Significance"" before in my other management class. their ideas are so useful in all managemnet work.",4
660,Task significance is one of the most important things companies must show their employees because is truly does help inspire people to work harder at what they do. No matter what you are doing in your line of work knowing that you are helping someone somewhere else makes you feel good. People get lost in their day to day lives and often forget about who they are helping and how they can help them better.  If companies showed employees their task significance and how it was helping others a few times a year would help keep people focused on the jobs that they are doing and will help the company as a whole. People need to be reminded of the importance of the work they are doing and how they are making a difference in other peoples lives.,4
660,"After listening to the broadcast, it really tough me a lot in teamwork. Besides work, many times it was very difficult to work in a team in school because you have to listen to everybody's opinion then come up with one that has the most vote. This process takes the most time for the whole project. At work, I think management should prepare to spend as much time as possible for all team member to understand the project so everybody is on the same page. Employee turnovers cost companies significant amount of money so they should take action before the employees lose their interests in the company.",5
660,"After listening to this podcast, task significance is a must for organizations to make their employees and teams aware of.  Too often when working on a project we get bogged down in the details of our part of the project and forget the bigger picture.  Not only does this effect the motivation for working on the project, but knowing the big picture and what the ultimate users of what you are working on can help each team member to increase performance.  Employee turnover is very expensive to organizations.  There are many costs to replace a team member including recruiting, interviews, background checks, orientation and onboarding, and training.  To make team members aware of the task significance of their job takes very little effort compared to hiring new employees not to mention the increase in performance.  All organizations should implements programs to make their members aware of the task significance of their position.",5
660,"WOW! The podcast was a great way for me to really learn how one's work can really benefit others.  Keywords that were used multiple times were ""benefit"" ""motivate"" make a difference"" ""care"" ""positive impact.""  These words were really powerful to hear because for a person who cares about helping others and making a difference, Adam Grant gave me a whole new perspective.  I never thought about how actually meeting someone that benefitted from someone's work can motive someone to do something even better.  The intervention Grant did with the fundraisers and lifeguards gave a whole new meaning to them because they were convinced and more motivated to do something with their job that had a result that Grant couldn't believe.  This goes back to job design about the importance of organization where you want to find resources to achieve strategic goals.  You want your entire staff to focus on what they are doing to get that positive result at the end.  By obtaining that, Grant gave three strategies from his findings about having a positive impact in a high task significance.  1.) introducing the people who directly benefitted from their work 2.)find stories to share 3.) for the managers to create forums for employees to share their own stories.  I think in any job environment, managers should constantly provide positive feedback on people's performance in any shape or form because you want your employees to love what they are doing and knowing that it will motivate them to do better.  Plus, the rate of success would increase since their performance and confidence in their job increased.  This might work on any jobs.  Of course, you have to think about factors that influence you to do what you do such as money (how much you get paid) and enjoyment (if you like or dislike your job).",4
660,"This podcast, I believe, was very good.  I think that many managers do not see the significance and importance to making your employees believe in what they do.  I believe in what I do but unfortunately not because my managers make me see it.  I work in a job agency and I am in charge of doing all the hiring/recruiting/interviewing/etc for one of our larger clients.  I sometimes get frustrated and don't want to return to work.  The presure and stress level isn't worth going through with the amount I get paid. But what motivates me is seeing the faces of the people seeking work.  Knowing that they are going through so much since they have to provide for their families.  Sometimes almost crying in the interviews as they tell me how much they need these jobs.  Than to see their faces when I do have a position for them, see how excited they get, and even a month down the line they are still excited and can't thank me enough.  That's my own motivation.  I do believe in what the podcast was talking about.  As managers, we need to not think that employees are ""self-interested.""  I think that providing high task significance for employees will motivate employees more than pay because the job itself will give people a purpose and will motivate them.  In turn, management will be able to keep atrition down and not have to pay employees more to work harder.",5
660,"This podcast was a very interesting and sort of scientific explanation of a phenomenon that i think most of us already knew about intuitively. Of course workers will be less motivated to do their jobs if they think they are totally meaningless and will be more excited about a job when they feel like they are ""making a difference"". I have experienced this myself. I worked in a restaurant a while back and my coworkers constantly teased me about how meaningless my job was and would sometimes just go ahead and seat customers themselves. this teasing was goodnatured but over time i found myself less and less motivated to go to job and constantly complained about hating it because it seemed pointless. I could have used one of these interventions but instead i found another job. I think it is very interesting that this basic principle is totally lost on many companies today and is a major source of decreased productivity , especially since it can be remedied so easily. The methods used in this podcast to increase workers' motivation were sometimes very insightful and creative, and other times, seemed quite obvious. I think that even if the companies i work for in the future don't employ these principles, i can use them to keep myself motivated about any job i have on my own, so this podcast may prove very valuable for me in the future!",4
660,"Task significance is very important in the working community.  I believe that managers, CEO's, etc... Should create some type of environment for their employees so that they feel and are aware how much their work is needed.  Many employees do not feel as if their work is that beneficial which can ruin someones motivation.  The more an employee is excited about their work and knowing that what they are doing is ultimately helping others that will increase their motivation which will increase their work rate and hopefully benefit the company. If employees can somehow see the affects that they are having on customers that can also increase competition levels within the working community which will push employees to the limit and help reach the best results possible.",5
660,"Many employees often think that their work has little significance and therefore do the minimum work required.  Employees follow rules and guidelines and often do not voice their own opinions thinking everything is already decided.  By showing employees the task significance of the work they do, they can motivate them.  People generally care for others any by knowing their work will benefit the lives of others, productivity can increase.  I use to be a lifeguard and I did not see much task significance.  I felt the job was really boring and had not much significance.  This led to a very short lived time as a lifeguard.  After listening to this podcast, I realize the potential affect of integrating task significance into job training.  I believe that doing so can maximize job performance, efficiency, and employee turnover rate.",5
660,"High task significance is important in work place because if each employees can do something beneficial, the the sum add up is powrful to the organization as a whole. Creating higher task significanse for the work environment should be a thing that managers try to do to make employee feel the importance of thier jobs and and thus the work performance will increase. I think that people forgot that jobs they do are actually important and make our lives better, and reminding them that they are making a difference may increase employee satisfaction and work performance.",5
660,"I thought this piece just brought a breath of fresh air to the corporate world!  I absolutely agree because I believe that as human beings, we feed off a sense of task significance, as it is a deciding factor of how much gravity we put towards our own success and even self value.  

I feel that is the one thing lacking in today's society.  There are jobs like teachers, nurses, etc., that people find so much interest in but the lack of money available in those areas hinders them from pursuing such careers.  ""Task Significance"" really takes that community service mentality and successfully integrates it into the corporate world to bring the passion and enthusiasm back.  It gives employees a reason to keep on waking up each morning, and work harder.  Not for the money, but for the affect it has on the customer.

The affect of being able to see the direct result of ones work is something that free lunches, ice cream filled vending machines, and a $100 bonus could never do.

660,"I really enjoyed this podcast on task significance because I have heard of this concept, but I never really knew what kind of effect it has on people.  I'm sure everyone has had a job where they don't think that they're making a difference, and I think that if employers actually take the time to place importance to the job, and emphasize that they can make a difference in people, they would have better productivity and increase profits.  
Adam gave a lot of examples that people think had high task significance, but in reality, it can still be applied to everyday jobs.  For example, if you're a cashier, you may not think much of the job but if your employer can place importance in you and how your job can affect other people, by either improving or worsening their day and how that reflects on the store and yourself, maybe you wouldn't feel that your job isn't important.  Although the response from employees does differ from person to person, Adam Grant's research helps to realize that placing task significance in jobs can boost profit, morale, and overall productivity in their workers.  But I think that in addition to task significance, they should also place importance on the individual as well because if a person feels that they are needed and not just a tool to make a difference, I think they would also be more willing to work.",4
660,"Task significance is really important for someone with a career that spends hours and hours everyday working.  To have your work mean something to people and knowing about it can greatly increase levels of work output and satisfaction.  Someone without task significance can get lost in the workplace and have no motivation to work harder and eventually be really unhappy.  This article was really enjoyable for me because it makes sense in every way.  Motivation is key to productivity and hapiness and in a way that is what task significance is, reassurance that your job is making a difference, or what your doing is making a difference.  Some jobs have greater or lesser degrees in what the company or person can do to show more task significance but even a little bit more effort to show task significance cannot be a bad thing.  The different examples he used for backing his claim that task significance makes people more dedicated and happy were all spot on, i feel like when i get a job task significance will play a big role.  Happinness has a lot to do in the workplace and keeping people happy and motivated is key, task significance does this to people because it is generally human nature to do good for other people, a good example for me is being able to make something or do something and have them directly see your work and they're reaction to it.  Its like giving someone a gift and being there for them to see it or just dropping a gift off at the party and leaving, there is no satisfaction in that and task significance is along these lines.  Task significance can range from a lifeguard to computer software technicians at microsoft, using this philosophy of task significance people will generally be more motivated and happier at work.",5
660,"Adam Grant's research is very interesting because in our society we like to maximize profits. having a sense of positive impact on wellbeing of others can have a major impact on the level of task significance. At my profession, we have a problem with a high turnover of certified nursing aids. The executive director is aware that stable employees are much more beneficial to the wellbeing of our elderly residents than employees that come and go. There is a system in place, where employees are rewarded by great benefits, extra cash for coming to work on time, baby or wedding showers and other recognition systems are organized by managers, directors and residents to motivate employees to stay. It provides safety, home-like environment and a great place to work in the world of non profit organizations.",4
660,"Interesting examples and really holds truth. In this new topic ""task significants"", Adam Grant goes about explaining what this topic is. People often don't see the significance in their tasks at the workplace. In every job, whether it is big or small, has a positive impact to society and to people. It is interesting because people often over look their jobs as being important to people. My job consists of a service as well as technical and I can see where task significance can help me keep me working at my peak performance. I see my co-worker dragging himself along and seeing no progression in his job but there is so much more to life than to fix a computer and move on. There is the relationship side that he is missing. This topic on task significance really helps me understand my colleague's motivation. Perhaps I could teach him about task significance.",5
660,"This podcast is amazing. It gives us many information about how to achieve a higher outcome by using the task significance. I absolutely agree that this can motivate the workers to provide better services to the customers. Also, this strategy can bring the workers and customers together.The workers can know more about what the customer wants and need and so it can help the company to keep the loyalty of customers.",4
660,This is the first time I heard about Task Significance. It is so true that if they have high task significance people will be satisfy and enjoy the work more and motivate them to work effectively and efficiently.

660,"An occupation may seem very much so as a duty of an individual.  
Task Significance is a very crucial aspect of any organization. However, many people

Individuals rely mainly on completing a certain task and having that sense of satisfaction of having completed a task. Although, realizing or at least having an idea of the positive 
influence your task may have on others, no doubt, will give you greater motivation in 

doing what you do. After weighing the benefits, one becomes more efficient knowing at the same time, the positive impact that the task 
has is much greater for the individual and for others as well. Adam introduced a very 
effective approach in enhancing ones motivation, ensuring productive behavior.  In my 
perspective, presenting the positive impact of ones work results in further productivity 
and should be done by all managers.",4
660,"After listening to the podcast and the topic of Task Significance, I realize people might get stuck at their position and just doing a job without realizing their work impact other's life. It is often good to have programs/activities to bring these workers and their consumers together so that this way it brings motivations and rewarding feeling to the workers. Especially for people who work in the medical field, knowing that their work help to save the changes of other's life. I think this is great way to bring people together and improve the quality of work as well as helping to keep a strong culture within the company.",5
660,"The study on task significance on job performance that Adam Grant did was interesting to hear about. It makes sense, but I think there are different levels of task significance performance because not every job is going to impact the lives of people directly like being a lifeguard or a fundraising caller would. I think Grant chose jobs that are somewhat easy to show how it may impact people. It would have been better if he had chosen careers that were not so noticable in how they impact people. Adam Grants study reminding me of people who have boring-un-fulfilling jobs, and amazingly enough Grant helped them realize they were fulfiling.  It kinda seems a little ""to good to be true."" I don't know maybe because I insist on those jobs being a little boring. I've tried to relate the same concepts Grant uses with my job. All I see is that what I do doesn't really impact anyone but the company I work for-I keep the business flowing and customers happy I guess. But I can't really find something to motivate me more. Overall, Grants study proves there to be a connection between motivation and task significance. And if we can find more signiface in our jobs I think things would be better in the work environment, but you have to like what you do as well. Regardless of finding significance in a job the person has to enjoy what they are doing or I would think there still wouldn't be any motivation. Thats where I question his study. Does task significance increase job performance if you do not enjoy what you are doing? My guess is NO!",4
660,"This is a new topic to me that ""task significant."" I think it is very important to find the task significants while they are working. Workers need to improve their efficiency and it impacts on their satisfaction directly. I guess that Adam Grant's two examples, which based on his research and experience, are interesting stories and this interview is useful infomation for students.",3
660,I thought that this podcast was very informative.  It gave me a new perspective on my own job and many other jobs out there that might seem robotic.  I think that it is very important for people to find their task significant in their job to be motivated to do their job.Technical Remarks:The quality was clear and easy to hear.,4
660,"I enjoyed listening to the podcast involving ""Task Significane"" and hearing about its motivational abilities on the employee. I find myself enjoying days at the office much more when I feel as if I had helped somebody. Benefits are nice, salaries are even better, but I think the biggest thing that keeps someone like me coming back to the office everyday is the ability to help someone else. The idea of linking the producers and actual end user is a brilliant concept I believe because it rewards them (worker) with desired recognition for the work.",4
660,"This pod cast was very interesting. At first glance, task significance seemed to be about doing important tasks first to create better productivity, but rather it speaks of how your job effect society.  This was great to listen to because there is definitely many of the elements spoken here to take into consideration when pursuing a job or career. What stood out most for me is the speaker used many personal references, examples and stories, which made the pod cast more interesting and legitimate. Over all I really enjoyed listening.",4
660,"What a wonderfully chosen speaker! Adam Grant's personal experiences in the work place really make his ideas more understandable. Not only does he inform about Task Significance, but also explains his trains of thought. 
When Grant explains what he derives from his observations...his ideas make much more sense! 
And he breaks it down to three simple ways to apply his findings, and explains how those tactics motivates higher performance. Very cool. Very through. Great examples!",5
660,"Task Significance is important for working environment beccasue all employees can help each other. Also, task significance can motive employees to reach their goals. For example, employees can set up the goals that they want to achieve in this year, task sigificance can be a job performance for evalution. I like the task significance becasue all employees can help and motive each other. In addition, the managers would try to make the employees feeling interested on the work and help them to achieve their person goals.",3
660,"This is very interesting and helpful material. I've learned what the task significance is and how it practically works in many companies. Task significance makes positive impact which helps others in organization or outside organization. It can simply benefit people with making others happier, building a relationship each other, or educating people. Outcomes of this practice are very positive. It motivates workers, gives them more satisfaction and meanings about their job, and performs better. Like he mentions, such companies like Volvo and Microsoft apply this by directly sharing the opinions and information.",5
660,I have never heard of task significance before I listened to this podcast. After listening to this I completely agree with everything that was said. In my job I have task significance but it is not very high. Although it is not high I loose my motivation a lot.  I loose my motivation unless the person I am effecting says something to my manager. Although I know I do a good job it is motivating to hear feedback. I also know that managers often keep those comments in the dark and do not tell me. I know once I am a manager I will recognize task significance and use the principles from the pod cast to motivate my employeesTechnical Remarks:Easy to use once you get the hang of the layout.,3
660,"Adam Grant's research on task significance sounds quite fascinating.  I think it's natural that *some* humans feel good and motivated if he/she knows that they are making a difference whether it's to themselves or to others.  Not every worker is going to enjoy their occupation right off the bat.  Grant explained several examples of workers in boring, mundane jobs, such as lifeguards and fundraising callers, who felt significantly more motivated when realizing they are making a difference for others.  Of course, I don't see these workers change their attitude towards their jobs right away, but I feel that at least they would appreciate what they're doing a bit more.  I remember one of my first jobs was a host for a restaurant.  Sometimes due to rude customers or extremely slow days, I always end up wondering why am I even working here.  Then there are tiny moments that make my job seem worthwhile such as meeting friendly, grateful customers when I seat them in a ""nice"" table.  These moments were brief and sparse, but I was motivated nonetheless.  No matter what the job, managers need to realize the importance of task significance.  Not every company is Google, and can provide all the fun activities to motivate workers, so companies need to find other means of motivating workers, such as task significance.",4
660,"The broadcast is really interesting. That is about the task significance which refers to the opportunity for people to make differences,contribute or help others. In addition, the concept of ""invisible task significance"" is very important, especially to the managment area. It helps us to think about the indirect contributions the employees make, such as automobile engineer, medical research, and the connection between the author and the reader. There is no direct contact between them, but there are still benefits. The higher the task significance, the more mativations from the employees. It is a good strategy for the manager to motivate the workers by letting them know how they make significant differences to others or the whole society. For the individul, they could also take advantage of this concept to improve themselves and to be pround of what they have done in the work. At last, I am really appreciated to learn about the task significant that betters my attitudes to the future job.",4
660,"The podcast on task significance was interesting and provided easily transferable business/management applications. I feel that the two studies conducted by Mark Adam supported the generally held belief that people who are motivated work harder giving the research face validity. Mark Adam also discusses employees who experience invisible task significance - or jobs that provide a needed service, but the employee is not able to connect to the client served. I think this is a common reality for many of todays workforce. While their job may be important and does in fact have task significance, the employee performing the day-to-day job is never able to see the end result of their hard work. Three examples of companies who have recognized the importance of bridging this gap were Volvo, Microsoft and Medtronic. The four approaches to job design outlined in our book were job simplification, job rotation, job enlargement and job enrichment. I think that job enrichment is most closely tied to the concept of task significance because it incorporates job responsibility as a key motivator.",4
660,"This podcast was somewhat interesting. I think task significance all starts at the top. If management does not emphasize task significance, then it will flow down to the employees. Personal responsibility is always a factor, but that also includes management...From a personal perspective, task significance has always been an important factor in what I do. When working in administrative services, we may never see the finished product, but we know it had to start somewhere and has a purpose. It's also always nice to get great feedback from your public on your work and keep you motivated to provide great service. It's even nicer when it is noticed by management. If not for the sake of personal gratification, than for future financial benefits.",3
660,"Adam Grant's theory of task significance and its affects on the work place are ideas that resonate very close to 'home' for me. For the past few years, I have been employed in the Events Industry and many of the jobs that I have held have felt as though they are significantly low in task significance. Although planning and executing events for clients can be fun and exciting, it can also be very stressful and feel less than rewarding. What I appreciated most about Grant's analysis of workers and their job satisfaction outlook is the fact that many people seem to become apathetic and disenchanted with their work and feel as though it's sort of a natural state in which to exist. When I began thinking of my dissatisfaction at work in regards to Grant's ideas, I realized that thinking back through years of thank you cards and generous appreciation made me feel a little better about doing something seemingly insignificant. While Grant's examples of surgeons meeting patients they've saved and car makers meeting safe consumers may overshadow my experience to a large degree, I feel confident that his theories are applicable to nearly every profession in some way, shape, or form. Overall, I thought this was an interesting and informative podcast and I appreciated Adam's thoughts on ways to improve the dismal state of the standard work place.",4
660,"I thought this podcast was an interesting.  I believe that it's important for everyone in an organization to realize the impact their job has, no matter what level of the organization they are in.  Knowing that an employee's work is making a positive impact helps motivate them to work harder and improve.  For example, the podcast discussed how Volvo shares stories of people surviving a car crash with their engineerings to help motivate them to continually make their product better.

I think it's important for managers to let their employees know about the positive impacts that their employees are contributing.  However, the podcast only concentrated on positive side of task significance.  People need to also know the negative impacts that their work is having.  Take the Volvo example.  Its great that they are letting the engineers know about the lives they are saving due to their designs but what about the lives lost because of a particular bad design? I think letting employees know about their potential negative impact their work can have can also motivate employees (and managers) to improve their job performance.",4
660,"We usually see work as an obligation. If it's not something we really enjoy or love, then we mainly feel like we have to do it because of our every-day responsibilities. Our job is usually there to bring an income and allow us to pay for all our bills and expenses, so often times it's not something we choose to do voluntarily. That's why many of us don't work hard at completing the tasks required by our job. We don't look to be too productive or successful, but mainly just hope to get the job done and that's it.

I believe that task significance is incredibly relevant in boosting our motivation, resulting in our more positive and productive behavior. Who would have thought that something this obvious has so much influence upon our actions. Showing us the results of our work is so effective that it should be done my all managers. When you're not working just for yourself or just to earn the money to cover your expenses, but for the benefit of the others as well, you become more efficient. When you see how your job has a positive impact on the life of others you can't help not have the desire to do better. You feel much more important, you feel like you play a more important role in society and your actions have more purpose. All that helps motivate you and pursue your goals with more passion.

I realize how I never actually gave this issue a serious thought, although it seems like common sense. Thanks to the research made in this area not only I become more aware of this solution, but also managers gain an important tool when it comes to motivating employees.",4
660,"I found the podcast on task significance extremely interesting. Adam Grant also explained the term invisible task significance which refers to making a positive impact on others with your work but not seeing the people whose lives you have improved. An example that he provided was medical research scientists who develop vaccines but never meet the patients who use them. Without a direct connection between the two parties, a loss of motivation can occur over time. 

Grants research implies that there is a correlation between task significance and productivity. When employees from a university call center got to meet only two or three of the students who received scholarships thanks to their work, callers ended up doubling the amount of money raised. Another sample included pool lifeguards who after hearing about real-life rescue stories performed by other lifeguards volunteered to work more hours.

The implications of this research can be very useful to organizations, especially ones in the health, safety and education industries. Introducing employees to the people who benefit from their work, finding and sharing stories about the impact of their work, and creating forums where employees can share their own stories are all strategies that companies can use to increase productivity and motivation among their workers.

I can see these ideas having a great effect for companies that have high employee turnover rates. If these organizations happen to be in industries with high task significance, the result could be even more dramatic. Employees in such industries already have a desire to help other people. Seeing the positive outcome of their work will only reinstate their values and motivate them to work harder.",5
660,"The most interesting point of the Task Significance podcast was the information the student gathered from his research--the fact that productivity and morale increased once the employee was able to attach an actual person to the other end of their job.  This suggest that people really are concerned about others and their well being as well as receiving monetary compensation for a job.  It was almost as if they got more satisfaction knowing that the person on the other end was happy.  Being a hairstylist, I can relate to this because I enjoy knowing that when my client leaves my chair, he/she will feel better about themselves. Sometimes, clients come to  the salonwith a lot on their mind, but during a service can relax and enjoy being pampered and let go of all that is bothering them, if only for a moment.  My goal is to make sure that my client is happy and in some way can leave my salon with a smile.  Improving my skills to better serve them will be more beneficial to them is so rewarding. I never had a word to describe what I feel while servicing my clients but now I do...task significance and there is not much I would trade my job for!",4
660,"It was a great pod cast and the information was presented in a way that was easy to understand. I like how he used specific examples to proves his points of task significance. I enjoyed not only the info he gave on the background of the topic, but also the personal input he gave, on how to increase task significance. I agree that with jobs that involve task significance you need to motivate and help show your employees that they really are making an impact. This is true with any thing an employee does, you want your employees to feel like their work is contributing to the success of the business. Because no one likes to do the so and called busy work that anyone can do.Technical Remarks:Downloaded fast and with no problems! Great!!",4
660,"I  really enjoyed this podcast about task significance.  I have been an employee for about 4 years now and this podcast has motivated me to find significance in my workplace.  I have always lost sight of the overall goal of my work task.  Usually it is because I am repeatedly doing the same day to day things.  By thinking about how my work is benefiting other people is a reward that makes me feel good, and makes me want to work more efficiently. I think this the topic of task significance is great for conceptual vision about the company's task.  Task significance gives me a broad understanding of why is my work important.  From my current perspective as an employee and not a manager,  I would recommend this podcast to managers as well as employees.  Employees can benefit from increasing their job motivation and satisfaction.  Managers can benefit from having lower turnover and happier employees!",5
660,"The theory of Task significance is so true. One of the most important things that you have to think about when picking your major is what interest you and what can you picture yourself doing for the rest of your life without hating your job. The reason why that is so important is because if you hate your job, you're not going to be motivated to wake up in the morning and perform to your fullest potential. It's obvious to me that task significance plays a major role in motivation in the workplace but some managers may tend to over see this. It is true that most managers may think that their employees are self interested and don't bother showing them how their work makes a difference. I like the idea of managers having forums for their employees to share how their work has an impact on others. I also think it's a great idea to have people come in and share their experience with how they have helped them or read letters from their consumers. Task significance does have an affect on employees' motivation and managers should do what they can to show their employees how their work impacts others in a positive way.",5
660,"It make so much sense that people would want to know the posative effect their job has on people. I just didnt know that when people understand that their job actually makes a difference they are more productive and more likely to stay with that job longer. It makes me look at my own job differently, to be more aware of the difference I am making in other peoples lives for the better.",4
660,"It is very interesting. It is very true that making a difference in your job, can drive you to work harder.",4
660,"I'm amazed that no one has researched this before, it seems like it should be fairly obvious to a thoughtful manager of people.  As managers we would like to feel like our employees are happy and like their job.  This is our task significance.  Why would some managers not relate that to employee jobs.  Yes, good pay, benefits and growth prospects should be obvious as motivation for employees, but people like to feel like they are working for something.  

I for one was glad to hear this podcast so I could know that someone was formalizing a study about these effects.Technical Remarks:loaded great, played without hitch.",4
660,"I found the research and ideas very interesting. It seems very practical but I'm sure not all managers think about these kinds of things in the workplace. People aren't going to motivate themselves all the time, it is the responsibility of the managers to keep people motivated to a certain degree.",4
660,"I thought the research on Task Significance was extremely useful for managers. Its so true that managers and employees forget how the work they are doing really affects consumers. I think the call center was am awesome example of how something so simple as having callers meet the students that receive scholarships really made a difference in performance and money raised. I can relate to a similar example, I was volunteering at the  no on prop 8 call center and after an hour of people not willing to donate time and or money, I felt really disheartened. But when I talked with friends who were gay and directly impacted by my efforts, I really felt good about what I was doing and it pushed me to make those calls. I especially think this kind of interaction is important for employees who are involved in making people safer, like auto engineers, medical researchers, etc. Its a wonderful things to see the direct results of your work. Imagine if all employers did this!Technical Remarks:As I mentioned, I really think that more managers need to do this. It may take some extra resources, but it seems from this research that the benefit is extraordinary.",4
661,"Interesting scenarios and practical student set-up that would provide stimulus for discussions. Requires multiple students participation, so probably not feasible for self-paced study.  The material could be used for both onground classes or during online courses, via wiki pages or synchronous group meetings.  Follow up assignments could be given after the discussions, based on the group's decisions.It was listed as a Drill/Practice material, but it should instead be relabelled as a Case Study material.Technical Remarks:Basic activity page was very easy to use.  Very little computer training is needed to access the material. The source link at the bottom of the page was broken.  There were extra letters and @ signs scattered throughout the scenario screen.",4

664,"The website provides mechanisms for some basic transformations in organic chemistry.Technical Remarks:The website doesn't seem to do a good job at differentiating between mechanistic steps and transition states. Bonds are shown moving with double headed arrows, and then, a transition state of bonds breaking and bonds being made is shown. This provides for repetative steps and also leads me to believe students may get confused as to what truly constitutes as a mechanistic step. Some type of differentiation would be appreciated. Also, this is quite a short list of reactions. A more thorough database of reaction mechanisms would be a large improvement.",3
664,"The animations would greatly benefit from either a voiced over narrative, or a side text block that explains some of the important aspects of the stereochemistry of reactions. For example, in the SN2 reaction, there is indication of 3 different R groups, but no indication as to inversion of configuration. This is also the case with regiochemistry of the epoxide ring opening reactions. For a student just learning these reactions, there is not a readily apparent reason why bases attack the less substituted carbon and under acid conditions the nucleophile comes in at the more substituted carbon. One other aspect of the acid ring opening that can be confusing it the statement that enantiomers can be formed. It would be very beneficial to have two different colored arrows showing attack of the carbocation from top or bottom and the resultant enantiomeric products in similar colors. I also think the SN1 could be improved by reversing the first and second slide in the sequence. By showing partial charges on the bromine and carbon in the initial slide, it would help students to understand why the bromine leaves and give a reason for the curved arrow. One other aspect lacking is lone pairs of electrons.Technical Remarks:The animations played smoothly and did not have any problems. There could be an explanation of the green button can be used to show the entire mechanism without pausing between slides.",3

671,"I would link to this site for my students except for a few problems that I consider important in my teaching.  First, the only species concept used is the Biological Species Concept.  I would suggest that this be broadened to include other important species concepts such as the Phylogenetic Species Concept and Evolutionary Species Concept.  It seems that we often oversimplify the species issue to the point that we fail to teach biological realities.  You might see the following paper for some thoughts of the value of teaching species concepts:Chung, Carl. 2004. The species problem and the value of teaching the complexities of species. The American Biology Teacher, 66(6):413-417.There is also an error that may seem minor, but it is in direct conflict with concepts I try to teach to my students.  This is the species name.  In the table of taxa, ""sapiens"" is listed as the human species name.  It is not; ""sapiens"" is the specific epithet.  The species name is a binomial, and the table is simply perpetuating a common misunderstanding that students have about this.A third problem I have noticed after revisiting this site is that the several of the pronunciations are in error.  Dipthongs should nearly always be pronounced as a single vowel sound but with the SECOND vowel long and the first vowel silent.  It is true that many teachers and biologists in general are not consistent in this; however, a teaching web site with audio should have this correct.  A useful reference that has a section  on pronunciation of scientific terms is Triplehorn, Charles A. and Norman F. Johnson.  2005.  Borror and Delongs's Introduction to the Study of Insects,

680,"Spent about a half hour on the material provided.  The material is well laid out and concepts get more complex in later chapters.  First time users may find this relatively easy to use, especially if they have experience in C++ or C#.  This material would not be suited for someone less experienced or with no knowledge of pointers or arrays.  The material could be incorporated into a programming languages course that discusses differences and similarities between all the generations of languages.  Then the students could compare and contrast these differences side by side between C and C++.  The title says it all, its a 'tutorial' and should be treated as nothing more.",4

707,"This lesson has a clear problem or need and real-world performance.  I like that students get to choose their final assessment.  Although, it would help if there was a rubric to guide students to what they need to have in their final product.  The guiding questions are very helpful to use throughout the lesson to help students along.  Although, it is not clear how to assess the students throughout the lesson.  The method is very clear and easy to follow.  I like the changes you made after the evaulation.  Showing the clip of the movie 300 is a great way to engage the students.  The meaningfulness is also a positive in this lesson.  It is very important for students to learn about other cultures because it makes them well-rounded citizens.  The age, skill level, and use of technology are all appropriate to the lesson.  The set of essential content could be more specific about what exactly they will learn about Ancient Greece.  This could be included on a rubric.  This is a great lesson that I would definitely use if a little more detail was added and a rubric was made.",4
707,"Positive Feedback: The lesson plan does a good job of providing specific examples (government and architecture) in the real-world performance section. The lesson provides a clear and detailed instructional objective. The lesson provides numerous choices for assessment products and gives some specific technology to use, including Glogster, Prezi, and PowerPoint. The lesson provides a specific step by step method for participants to learn. The lesson provides for a last step of filling in gaps in learning that were noticed during evaluation. Novelty piece of motivation reaches out to students through the use of a popular culture example, the movie 300. The lesson provides opportunity for students to work together and to gain socialization through small group activities. The lesson is developed for an appropriate audience and it provides detailed information about student prerequisite skills, including Internet and group work skills. Technology needs are appropriate for the creator’s environment and for many current educational environments.Critical Feedback: The set of essential content could be more detailed, especially in regard to specific content about Ancient Greece. Evaluation information does not mention a rubric or standard set of grading guidelines. The lesson is detailed but lacks detailed information about the product that is expected to be turned in by students. Meaningfulness of motivation is limited in spectrum and does not show evidence of reaching students of different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Pleasant consequences section of motivation is also limited in spectrum.Technical Remarks:Good job of adding ""Greek City States Guiding Questions,"" but hyperlinks did not work for me.",4
708,"Ther are many references are in this wiki, but it is initially hard to find your way around. However, once you do, you find that you then can navigate the wiki and find the resources that are helpful to teachers, especially college faculty. ",4
708,"This material was just one page of a wiki, and as such it was okay but I thought the website as whole would make a better submission to MERLOT so I tried to go to the homepage but it is non-existent. I clicked on Instructional Design which at first looked great but every link I clicked out was not working so I think unfortunately this website needs updating or removal.",2
709,"On the whole this is a very good lesson plan. I like how you've tried to incorporate various aspects of ULD. The learnig objectives are very clear and the lesson plan details the objectives, process, testing, and application. I also like the incorporation of CC, as this is often overlooked. Prezi is a good tool for free, but it is far better with the paid version.Technical Remarks:Some of the links did not work because they were pointing to your harddrive instead of a public location. The Prezi does not jump to instructions, instead it jumps directly to the video.",4
709,"Overall, this seems like a very good lesson that details certain animal behaviors. Using the modifications, it seemed as if it would work well with students who learn in different ways (not just visual or auditory). The content is extremely engaging and would keep the attention of students. The use of the Prezi is amazing, and it seems like it would help all students see and hear in the information. If the CC’s do not work, it may be helpful to use another source (like the lesson plan mentions). It may be useful to include more student led activities. This lesson seemed somewhat teacher driven and did not focus as much on student discovery of knowledge. Guided notes are good, but it may be useful to use a tool like Voicethread to give students a multitude of ways to view or hear the information.Technical Remarks:This lesson plan seemed to work fairly well. Some of the links to PDFS and PPTS did not work. The links to outside resources did work. The link to the Prezi worked. ",4
710,Outstanding source of information for instructors.  Well organized with loads of information about a large range of animals.  The site includes exercises that can be used in the classroom.,5
711,"Although advertised as ""animated"" there is very little animation in this site. The small amount of animation, showing how a fiber optic cable converts signals is useful. The drawings are very well done. This is a good addition to any conversation on fiber optic cable",5
711,The site seems shorts but used animation to help provide information on fiber optic cable. ,5
711,"This is an interesting site on fiber optic technology. While there was not a lot of information, it did clearly explain the advantages of fiber optics.Technical Remarks: The illustrations are very well done, and the animation depicting how light travels through the cable was neat.",4

711,"A short, but detailed tutorial about fiber(fibre?) optic cabling and its uses. This site also has a nifty animation detailing how light travels through the cabling.",5
712,"While I like the visual aspect here, for me having more animation with audio would be optimal. Lots of good info there to read, however, I think it would have worked better for a visual person as a caption or audio to a more animated product.",4
712,"Since most people are visually oriented, this simulation is very useful to illustrated how a packet actually travels through a token ring network. Network topics are difficult to convey since what happens to data as it travels down a wire cannot be seen. This illustration can be used to reinforce material in a lecture on token ring networks.",5
712,This site talks about token rings and give some graphics on how they work.They also write about Token Ring Operation using a Hub which I found intersesting.  Overall a good site on token ring.,4
712,"Excellent explanation and diagrams of the basics of Token Ring and it shows how data is sent, received and acknowledged.Technical Remarks: Links are adequate but could be more resourceful. ",5
713,I found the simple animation very informative.  I work as a Technician in Dialysis and most of the learning material for Techs and patients describes the process in a complex way.  This simplified the process and yet showed exactly how dialysis works.  It would be good for teaching students as well as dialysis patients.Technical Remarks: Very easy to use.,4
714,"It is an interesting tool to see how the algorithms work, but there should be a link to some material to help students to review some important concepts about sort algorithms.",3
714,"I very much enjoyed using these animations to display the different algorithms.  It would be very benificial to non-computer types to grasp the concept of the different types of sorting algorithms.  Technical Remarks: To enhance the graphics, it would be nice to see the actual code being stepped through.",4

719,"I have a great interest in learning and knowing great people's personal life. I try to avoid biography of great scientists and inventors because most of the articles focus more on the invention or achievement more than the person's personal life. This article is not any exception to that. It's definately educational, but my concern is it would keep a readers attention too much. I also think the the article have too many quotes from other resources and have very little about his personal. If it was not for a class assignment, I would skip after few minutes. Since I did finish through the doc, I now know more about his invention and theorems. I found that none really had much in-depth analysis and some stuffs are repeated like the given values of pi. A bit more analysis of topic and little reduction of   quotes would make it more readable. Of course, a bit touch of personal life would make it more interesting reading.Technical Remarks:Software is easy to use. If pages are broken down to  smaller pages and have next/previous button, it would have been easier to read.",3
719,"This site was very well put together in terms of who Archimedes was, his life and his passions. I found this site very useful and very easy to understand, much easier to understand and read then the page on Galileo. Archimedes's  website, was very clear and precise, and was divided out into different categories such as his fascination with the subject of Geometry, and then his most significant contributions and accomplishments where mentioned. Having the page divided out like that gives students a better understanding and a broader picture on who Archimedes was and what he has done that has made him so famous. This can be used in any classroom Science or Math and I think students with math problems and students who have trouble understanding and learning such rough subjects like math and sciences would gain a better understanding in terms of people who made a name in math history. ",5
719,"After reading this article I think I now know what I am going to do my final on. This article on Archimedes was incredible. It gave so much information on the man its unbelievable. Anybody who is interested with the history of math would love this article, I never knew that so much happened with math back in his period of time, B.C.In this article I read that he is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all times. I have heard of the name Archimedes before but I thought he was only a mathematician but acording to the article he achieved fame by his mechanical inventions. Archimedes was killed in 212 BC during the capture of Syracuse by the Romans in the Second Punic War after all his efforts to keep the Romans at bay with his machines of war had failed. After reading this whole article I have gained a great deal of knowledge on Archimedes, I never knew any background or information on the man before. He accomplished many things in his life which also included the publication of many books he wrote and from what I read died in a very bad way. If I do decide to write my final on him then this article will be at the top of my works cited page.",5
719,"I read this site and some of it's links.  I think that it is important to incorporate the history of math into the lesson plan.  I feel less resentful of math, for some reason, when I know of its history and where it came from as well as the great efforts the mathematicians made to bring us this knowledge.  Technical Remarks: I found this site to be very informative; I know more about Archimedes now than I ever did before.  This site showed me how and why certain concepts are so useful and important.  The site presents its material in as accurate a way as historical documents will let them.  I think that the information on this site is educationally significant because history is a big part of learning.  I think that students should know where their lessons are coming from and how it applies to everyday life and this is something that should be taught at a young age.  I think that informing the students of the history and mathematicians behind math concepts would help most of them to better appreciate what they are learning and this will enhance they're growth academically.  This site was very user friendly.  I appreciate the author's awareness that we're not all math and history savvy, so they highlighted the more difficult vocabulary and in it's own seperate little link provided you with the definitions.  This was very helpful.  At the very end they also provided you with a number of related links so you can follow up and learn even more material related to the subject.  ",5
719,"I first accessed this article on April 6th when I signed up for MERLOT. I was browsing around the program to see what it was all about, was reading this material & decided to print it out as it is easier for me to read, but to no avail as I could not get the program to go to the beginning of the article so I decided to try again later. Yesterday, I printed it out & read it. That took me about 25 minutes. I enjoyed reading about Archimedes life and accomplishments very much. It was well written and I understood most of it. People interested in history and math will certainly be inspired to learn of Archimedes' numerous accomplishments, especially since he lived & died in the BC era! The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching & learning is great throughout the article mainly because the links are so good. I did not take alot of time to explore all of them because of my own time restraints. But, if I were doing a write up of Archimedes I would definately use the links to refine my research & help with the writing of it. Some of the terminology is hard to follow as I do not know many math terms. Having a dictionary handy is helpful. I learned a lot about Archimedes & enjoyed the insight of what it was like in those days. ",5
719,"This web site is all about Archimedes of Syracuse and I got that.  But what i really didnt like was there organization of the web site.  I thought it should have broken up the site in titles, columns, and what not.  Overall I was fairly distracted by the lack of organization",1
719,"I spent about one hour reading the essay and browsing through the myriad of interesting links offered within this interesting site. Since this site is located in the ""general and liberal arts math"" section of the Merlot Resource, I was not expecting anything too focused and specific in terms of mathematical concepts, theories and dialogue. What I found was exctly what I expected. A very easy to read, interesting, general overview of the life and accomplishments of Archimedes. I was so fascinated by the content and how it was represented, that I did not find myself getting distracted or losing interest, even while I took the time to investigate the other highlighting many other well known and interesting figures within the world of mathematics. The quality of the content is  exceptional for the level in which it should be analyzed and for the level in which it should be shared as a learning tool for other students. It is obvious that there has been a lot of time and effort spent in the compiling and laying out of this particular project. I feel, with the variety of data, and the amount of relative links shared throughout the site, that this would definately provide a great first exposure to students who are not normally interested in this type of subject. And this would definately provide a fantastic springboard to gather ideas for students who are preparing to embark in a major study concerning Archimedes and his accomplishments. This is obviously not going to be the stand-alone, nest of knowledge concerning the topic of Archimedes. And it wasn't meant to be, this topic is too vast to exemplify completely in one shot. I'm sure we will see more detailed examinations of Archimedes studies located in the more specific forums located in the Merlot site. But what this site does do,
 is offer a great general analysis of Archimedes for all students to share, regardless of interest, or level in math. I think this would make a great introductory tool for any classroom, or student seeking to get their feet wet, as far as the subject of Archimedes is cconcerned. Technical Remarks: I felt it was fairly easy to navigate. As always, it is always nice to add interactive depth for those who have stronger auditory, visual, kinesthetic and spatial learning strengths.",4
719,"I am currently writing a paper on Archimedes so I found this site extremely useful. I spent about 20 minutes reading the information written on this website, but I have spent much more time accessing the various links for additional information on Archimedes. I think the links at the bottom of the page are probably the most useful. I will continue to utilize this site as a home-page of sorts, in my research. The information listed overall was useful and easy to read and it gave a good biographical view of Archimedes. It just wasn?t as detailed as I had hoped in detailing all of his mathematical accomplishments. It is great for those looking for a very high-level overview but, if you need to dig deeper, I highly recommend accessing the links at the bottom of the page. Particularly the list of references that were used in creating this page, those books will come in very useful if you need to do some significant research. Overall the quality of the content is good, and if you need more info on Archimedes there is an abundance of information to be found using the links this site suggests.",4
719,"This site is not very well put together . THe writing is poor, but it has alot of information about Archimedes.  Over all, an ok site, that could use a bit oif retooling.",4
719,"This project turned out to be a labor of love and I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed perusing these web sites.  As a History Major, I focused on the math history sub-categories and was pleased to find a great biography on Archimedes of Syracuse.  I spent several hours on this one and I think this personal account of Arhcimedes was very well written and extremely informative.  We studied this most famous of scientists of the Hellenistic period in my Western Civilization class last year and Dr. O'Connor did a great job in bringing him back to life.  Archimedes was especially important for his work on the geometry of spheres and cylinders, for establishing the value of the mathematical constant pi, and for creating the science of hydrostatics.  His accomplishments are indeed inspirational.  He is credited with the discovery of specific gravity simply by observing the water he displaced in his bath.  He may have even devised the so-called Archimedean Screw used to pump water out of mines. He also developed a pulley for transporting heavy weights.     Dr. O'Connor was extremely accurate in his treatment of the facts surrounding Archimedes during the period of 287-212 B.C.  His work closely parallels the events as chronicled in other historical texts and he offers them in a clear and concise manner.  The major significance of Dr. O'Connors work, as it related to our present day math class, may be more philosophical than practical as he states ""although Archimedes achieved fame for his mechanical inventions, he believed that pure mathematics was the only worthy pursuit.""Technical Remarks:      Easy access on this History of Mathematics sub-category and it also provides many additional hours of great reading through a long list of related web sites. Math historians will love it.",5
719,"The method this student employed for the Merlot webpage was trial and error, which lasted approximately half-an-hour. After navigating through several points on this webpage I came upon an article entitled ?Archimedes of Syracuse?, by J. O?Conner & Prof. E. Robertson. The procedure I followed was to read the article several times, and that took a couple of hours. What I enjoyed about the manner in which this article was assembled, were the embedded links for Kepler, Cavalieri, Fermat, and Newton, all of whom Archimedes influenced. Although it required another couple of hours to read about Kepler, Cavalieri, Fermat and, Newton, it was well worth the time spent to learn of their works, their mathematical contributions, and how they were influenced by Archimedes. The Archimedes embedded math terms, tangents, infinitesimals, and ellipse, were also quite helpful. How I used this information would be best described as self-help instructional. Personally, I found the segment on ?Archimedes' principle [which] states that any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid is acted upon by an upward force which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body,? quite interesting because I?ve often heard of a particular battleship or submarine weighing so many gross tons followed by the volume of Water displacement. Now I understand not only where this math principle originated from but the originator, Archimedes. As just stated the content was instructional by deftly covering Archimedes mathematical concepts and contributions without overwhelming the student with plethora of factoids and/or minutia. In my opinion,
 this article will be well utilized by either a student and/or instructor in the course of considering the history of math as it pertains to how math is utilized in our modern world; after all, it is always good to understand where things come from and how they are built upon by succession of individuals and societies. How this and subsequent linked articles were written the methodology was user friendly, while making navigation from one link to another and back again uncomplicated.",4

721,I spend one hr on this problem and I thought it was a lot like black jack but the goal was to try to get to 24 using the distributed law I thought that it was really easy to use and I loved how the numbers where using cards it made it really fun I thought that it would be a good help to use in class as game to think about the distributed law ,3
721,I found this game very fun and challenging.  I was playing the game about 45 minutes trying to come with the number 24.  The instruction were easy to understand.  This game has the ability to teach you simple equations and make you think quickly.  What made this difficult for me is that the value of the face cards were different.  Overall this game is very fun and I would recommend the game to my friends.,4
721,"I found this game fun and interesting. I was unfamiliar with the card game, but was easily playing the software version of it in just a few minutes. I drew a queen and didn't know how many points a queen was worth, but the instructions immediately answered my question. I took about 2 minutes reading and understanding how the game worked and then I played it for 25 minutes. The quality of the game was good, especially the appropriate sound effects. This game has potential for teaching a young student how to do simple equations. It would be easy for a first time user to play.Technical Remarks: No technical difficulties found.",5
721,"This was the most fun to play! I spent an hour trying to get my points up. It definitely made me think about how to use the various mathematic functions to get to a total of 24. This not only teaches you to think quickly, but drills in your mathematical tables. The only problem I found with this one was that the face cards appeared to have different values than I am used to. Apparently, Jacks equal 11 points, Queens, 12, and Kings, 13 - but Aces represent only 1.   ",5

However, requires the ""faculty developer"" to share examples where these strategies actually have worked, and to back up the claims in the table.",4
729,"Superb list that should be posted at every computer of every online instructor!! The only thing missing was a reference to a grading rubric for discussion questions. All too often I see online instructors throw out questions for students to answer with absolutely no guidelines. Students soon become frustrated and bored, and then the instructors wonder why there is no interaction!!! Instructors also need to monitor the discussions and throw in a comment or two to let the students know that it IS important (and why). The point about helping students understand how to tie their comments to the content is EXTREMELY important!<",5

748,"The sheer variety of exercises and activities given with each lesson of Breaking News English makes for an enormously useful resource for ESL/EFL instructors. As with a textbook, the site provides a consistent structure and guide for the classroom--those instructors with heavy teaching loads will find the suggested ready-made tasks of great benefit in saving time while preserving quality. In Breaking News English, activity and exercise types--cloze, gap fill, true/false, etc.--are repeated from one reading to the next, which with some exposure allows learners to focus less on the instructions for each task and more on content, new and unfamiliar vocabulary, new grammar structures, etc. The news articles are updated on a very frequent basis, and the content of the articles more often than not seems engaging for learners, especially in an EFL environment.

To comment on the peer review of Breaking News English, I must say that I disagree with the concern as to poor layout of the site. While the site may not be instantly attractive to learners, instructors with an eye for well-designed lessons and exercises will find what they are looking for without difficulty.",5
749,This is an okay site.  i browsed through the site for about 10 minutes.  there is some good information on this web site.  i don't think it is that effective on enhancing learning but it still gives good info on expert systems.Technical Remarks: This site has very good detailed information.  it really shows you everything about an expert system and is written simply where everyone can understand.,3
750,"Good for demonstrating concepts.  Not ""exciting""",3
751,Excellent informative Site.,5
752,It is great for upper intermediate and advanced English students. They present a large collection of audio files with conversations and lessons.,5
753,There are specific tutorials available for several aspects of IT.  The tutorials are easy to follow and could easily be assigned as additional reading and practice exercises.  Ther are several steps to jump through however to get to the specific content desired and some require you to sign up to a specific MSN group for access.,3
754,I spent 10 minutes looking over the material.  The lessons follow a standard format for introductory programming courses.  The material is easy to understand and complete with examples and step by step instructions.  I fully intend to include this site as a reference for my C++ Programming course.  The only drawback is that the site is cluttered with advertisements.,5
755,"I spent about ten minutes looking over the site.  There are many small tutorials on specific aspects of the C++ language.  Example code is provided with each explanation.  This site is not intended to teach C++ programming, instead it provides additional information and explanation.  Pages are uncluttered and easy to follow.",4
756,"I actually spent three hours revewing the material and making a class presentation out of it where I would first define basic geometric terms such as a line and what a circle is as well as how to find the radious of a circle the diameter and circumfrence of a circle. I would then present students with a group of java circle progams enabling them to grasp the geometry behind circles and help them with any questions they may have. I would do this same setup with other parts of the website once they grasp how to correctly do the questions that are presented on this software.
2.I feel that this material is extremely educational significant to high school studets who are struggling with learning the characteristics of geometry and this could work for college students as well who are taking geomtery or trig classes. The one feature that i found extremely usefull especially for me since i dont know anything about trig or geometry is that it has homework problems and if you have any questions about how to solve the equation and if u get it wrong it will help u understand how to fix it. With that feature you can use it while you are doing your homework or studying for a test.
C.If the teacher has the abvility to run this program on his or her computer I think this program would be extremely useful in teaching students about trig or geometry and going over there homework.  The animations would be the most usefull for students beacuse it gives u how how to form two perpindicular circles with a line in between them as fast or as slow as u wish in making sure you grasp how to do this problem correctly.
D. I think first time users would find this material enjoyable and helpful if they have a trig or geometry book next to them in order for them to look up anything they dont know. As well as have a general understanding about the basics of geometry or else it won't make any sense to you. Due to the fact that it shows u how to do equations. But doesnt give u any text material about these equations. So keep that in mind when visting the program. As well as u can't open another section without closing the section you allready opened first.",5
757,"This is a great concept! I have done a similar activity with 3rd graders and they loved it. However, it can be very case specific as many classrooms are simply a rectangle and so the challenge would not be as high for any teacher to implement it. By using technology or giving them sample rooms (maybe famous ones, like in the white house or at the mall of america) you could have made an even greater connection to the outside world and potentially used differentiation.Technical Remarks:Other than the Youtube video, it seemed to lack a great use of technology. You could have had them show all their work on the computer or work in a program to create a scale model/replica of the classroom to measure the area another way. Then using an online calculator for the math. The youtube video worked perfectly.",4
757,"I am a fifth grade teacher that is evaluating this lesson plan.  Although I have not had the chance to use this lesson in my classroom, I will evaluate the structure of the lesson.  The author incorporated a u tube video for student learning on finding the area of triangles and rectangles.  This allows students to hear information from someone other than the teacher.  This lesson also fostered collaboration.  The teacher was conscientious of student behavior, ability, and socialization of peers.There was no self assessment and reflection to this lesson.  This lesson should conclude with a online discussion, classroom discussion, or survey.  This would help the instructor see if students truly understand the math concepts.  Using clickers could also be a great tool to quickly assess knowledge of all students.Technical Remarks:No technological issues found.",4

760,"Now, I have no idea about anything involving calculus. After checking out this site focusing mainly about calc, i came to a better understanding of what it is and how it can help me learn more about calc. It gives you functions, equations, free tutorials and problems to try. I think its a great website. It gives you sort of definitions to some different subjects on calculus too. You can click the type of problem and you would get examples to see how to do it. It's great.",5
761,"1) I reviewed the materials on this site by reading it thoroughly, downloading the Java VM to my computer because I was unable to view the applet until I did, trying out the applet once it loaded and also using the ""public performance"" example and teaching it to one of my co-workers.

2) I thought that the quality of the content was excellent and was very thought out when written. Not only is there an applet that one can play around with but, there are also other examples one can use through paper and a pencil if they do not have a computer.

3) This site is very effective in teaching how math is used in everyday uses such as a calendar month. It gives the people (like myself) who are not too fond of math a new way to appreciate mathematical concepts.

4) The materials on this site are very easy to use but, if you block popups on your computer like I did, then you might not be able to view the applet that is the most crucial part of the entire website.Technical Remarks:The actual applet does not work unless you download the Java VM or you turn off the popup blocker from your internet.",4
761,"1. I went on the site and just read through it, taking as much time as I needed to understand what they were trying to teach. But as I read I did also try the activity on the page, and tried it till I understood the mathematical properties of the calender.2. Yes the site accurately presents the concept that the calender has a ""magic squares"" property to it. And it also explains other areas besides calenders where you can find this property.3. I think its very effective in teaching students to look deeper at things where we just assume no mathematical pricipals could lie. Its teaching us to find math in everyday things that we take for granted.Critical thinking in learning can be enhanced through sites such as this.4. I found it very easy to use the software if you just read the directions carefully.",4
761,"1. Well i had spent about 35 minutes on the material.2. I did not know at first what you were trying to teach us but by going over it a little more. I had understood it a little more.3.If people do use this right, i believe people would understand what you are teaching.4. When people first try it, it will be a little hard. after looking over it people will get it",3
761,"1. Spent about 30 minutes reading it and trying to manipulate it properly by myself.2. I didn't really understand the concepts that were trying to be taught. I also couldn't undertsand the directions for the bottom exercise.3. I thought the second exercise was interesting (about the number in the middle always being the average) and that you could predict the missing number in the series. This was a good concept and was well demonstrated.4. It was easy to use, but hard to understand.  Technical Remarks: The author makes the assumption that all students are computer savvy and understand such terms as 'java' and 'applet'. This is not always the case! ",3
761,"Good explanation of calendar. More than the applet the accompanying notes are very informative and useful. Combined with the applet they explain the ways of keeping dates very well. Could be used very well in history classes, making the lesson more interactive by speculating on, for example, the day of the week of a particular date!",3
762,Excellent collection of resources and lesson plans,5
763,Cancer grapically illustrated from its molecular origins to its organ pathologies.  This website includes current therapies.  Understandable for the high school student. Another stellar learning experience from the CSHL.  Chime molecular representations would have made this material spectacular.,5
765,"This web site is easy to use and informative about the various elements that go into the carbon footprint. Some questions that go into the ""footprint"" calculation are easy (how many miles do you drive your car per year and what is its gas mileage), but others are harder to answer accurately (what is your average monthly expenditure for fruits and vegetables). One also might wonder how accurate some of the correlations are. For example, the amount spent on water/sewage depends on usage, but also very heavily on the local utility rates. Despite those quibbles, the net result comparing one's carbon footprint to the rest of the US and the world should be illuminating to students interested in global warming and greenhouse gases.",4
766,The content is out of date and is not based on current national guidance from the Resuscitation Council (UK. Hence the content is incorrect,1

770,Great descriptions of the various career paths for students.  I love the use of online links to enhance the lesson.   Clearly describes the problem and what NET’s will be covered.  Lesson will give students a good grasp of career options available.  I totally plan to use this lesson for my students.,5
770,"This is such an important topic to get kids thinking about early. The topic should be inherently motivating (maybe not to 8th graders, yet). It addresses several learning styles and instructional strategies. I found the focus on transferable knowledge and skills an important point stated as a need and goal in addition to focusing on specific jobs. Allowing students to work in groups allows for more discussion, exploration, and reflection than if doing assignment alone. I like the use of a spreadsheet or table to summarize and apply their knowledge rather than paper and pencil. It allows for quick revisions as group discussion progresses. I would have liked to have seen an example of what career information the students were provided to classify.Technical Remarks:A link on the www.mich.gov site to a PDF  file was broke.",4
770,This lesson was highly engaging and meaningful for my 8th grade students.  There is some preparation involved.  You need to look up descriptions for the Career Pathways and make sentence strips for that part of the activity.  The websites provided are high quality and easy to use.,5

774,"Not really a simulation, but gives a clear description about how the CSMA/CD technology works with both text descriptions and pictures. May be too math oriented for some CIS or MIS students.",5
774,"This site is very simple, straight forward and nothing but the facts. It gives a great explaination of CSMA/CD, but it isn't very exciting. There is alot of information on each page that could be easier to understand if it were broken up into smaller sections. It could also use more graphics.",4
774,This site is to detail for me to understand completely.  For some in the field it would  be useful information on data communication.,4
775,This website is great for helping instructors desgin materials for students with special learning needs.  The website provides many other websites and lising of what other sources are doing to help students with special learning needs.,4
777,"This is a great instructional tool that allows students to work at their own pace and get information to compare the cell structures of bacterial, animal, and plant cells. It is easy to use and go back and forth between slides. The cell parts are compared to real life examples and are easy to relate to for students. There is audio that reads the slide so that if anyone has trouble with comprehension they can have it read to them since the vocabulary is difficult. There are some videos which show actual cells in motion and structure which are quite neat. There is a great deal of content in this resource so you would need to set up several lessons to go through everything. Also there is no autocorrect or tool that states additional information if you get something right or wrong on the last chart. Overall this is an excellent all around resource for students and teachers. Great work! I spent 30 minutes reviewing this lesson.Technical Remarks:Uses powerpoint in regular mode and has audio and external media sources.  Make sure computer allows for external media.",5
777,"Great interactive resource for students learning about cells.  You have great visuals showing the different parts of the cells, but I really enjoyed how you used images to help the students better understand the job of the different cell organelles.  Since you have students 'click' to get the answers, I would recommend using this as a cell study guide or have students partner when reviewing the interaction.  Each partner can keep score on the number of answers the other gets right or wrong.  This might help ensure they are not simply clicking through mindlessly.",5

779,"This is a pretty neat concept! Users can scroll through various organic reagents and have them react with the inorganic compounds above. Once a reaction occurs, a new set of reagents will appear and the process repeated. I find that if an activity involves a time-crunch or a score, that students are more competative and then become more focused on the activity. Speeds can be adjusted to change difficulty.Technical Remarks:The system is rather simple and only pertains to reactions involving inorganic reagents with organic reagents (i.e. LiAlH with a ketone).",4

The difficulty is that it contains no write-up or explanations for what principles you are covering or what lessons you are meant to learn from the demonstration.  For example, the difference in use between CYMK colors for subtraction and RBG colors for addition is unclear.Technical Remarks:Very simple, very clean.",3
795,"I spent a little over 15 minutes looking over the material on Pascal's Triangle.  This is a good quality tutorial on the triangle.  Not only does it have very useful information and history on the subjest, but if you don't understand the material by reading it, there is also a interactive activity that makes it even more clear.  The interactive triangle is very helpful, and puts some fun in learning the material.  When I first looked at it, it was very easy for me to understand what I needed to do.  I would recomend this for anyone that has no previous knowledge or backround on Pascal's Triangle.",5
796,"Fun way to explore the periodic table. A few students in my class love comic books, so I know that they would enjoy this.",4
797,"1.	I started reviewing the material about two-weeks ago now. I have built an assignment around the material. The site will be used as a learning object for students familiarizing themselves with the basic tools and materials used in Agricultural Mechanics. I have reviewed each part of the material myself. It is a great study aid. I am especially interested in the additional categories for farm power and small engines that are being added.2.	The site contains information that is very useful in a modern, basic agricultural mechanics classroom. Many of the tools are up to date and detailed. Some comments could be added about the proper use of some of the tools. At this time the site is set up for students at Fresno who are attending the classes that the topics pertain to. The site's overall usefulness is related to the user being in Agricultural Mechanics.Technical Remarks: 3.	If used properly the site will allow students to increase their ability to identify and comment on the general tools and materials used in Ag. Mech. They will also be able to identify and share some information about many of the materials used. This site has potential to allow for enhanced student learning and faculty teaching. A welcome addition would be the ability of students not attending the program to test themselves on the objects. A page allowing them to be scored on their test evaluation.4.	The software is extremely easy to use. The web links are labeled clearly and it is easy to find the information you are looking for. The test session that exists now is very helpful in allowing students to drill & practice. The only letdown is the inability of the student to check themselves without returning to the main menu and searching for the corresponding picture.",3
798,This lesson seems well organized and it seems to adhere well to the UDL principles overall.  It is very easy to see that you used reverse design in creating this lesson and the goals are very clearly stated.  My primary concern is that students don’t have many options or paths to take when it comes to demonstrating their understanding of the content.  I have had any experience with flipcharts myself but would be interested to see if their was a way to incorporate and type of videocast into them for students who struggle with learning and demonstrating understanding with text.  Student who might struggle with reading may struggle with aspects of this assignment.  I would love to seem some technology aides incorporated such as text to talk to help those students who might not be able to handle the reading load that well.  Overall I think your lesson is well organized. ,4
798,"Even though I am not very knowledgeable about the content, I can see that the author has put a great deal of work into developing this resource. The content seems meaningful and the tool used to reach the desired outcomes is very interesting. I have not used a smartboard activity before, so I would have to actually use it in my classroom to be able to see the strenghts and weaknesses of the tool. I would suggest that you add more details to the essential content to clarify any questions other teachers might have. Additionally, I'd like to know what tool will be used for the perfomance task, if there is any.  Technical Remarks:I cannot comment on the technicalities of the lesson as I have never used a smartboard.",4
799,"While this resource has entertainment value, I could not see a clear educational value. Users are asked to provide words that are then generated into a sentence or paragraph by a computer program. It is not clear how this might help a student generate sentences on his or her own.",3
799,"This sight was a lot of fun.  It's very simple and easy to use if you're a native speaker or an ESL student who has some experience with computers and the Internet. I took about 5 minutes to go through each activity.  There aren't many directions or examples, but I think that a teacher can provide students with that part before they actually navigate the site on their own or with others.What's good about this site's activities is that you can replace parts of the sentences with your own words. This is a good exercise if you want students to notice different parts of speech and to help them use a variety of word choices. However, I wouldn't recommend this site to low-level ESL students without assistance or a review of possible word choices such as time, kinds of food, hobbies, and activities.  The site doesn't automatically correct or highlight errors.  Still, it might help to print out the generated sentences and point out to students where they are mistaken.At the top of the site there is a menu of links that leads to other activities like quizzes, games, and other lessons.  This site is actually part of a larger site called ?Interesting Things For ESL Students? located at www.manythings.org.  However, this site is listed as a separate page.Technical Remarks: What I really like about this site is that it is very easy to navigate.  It's not cluttered with links or images that take a long time to load up. The categories and links are very well organized and easy to find. Even if you go to the main site (www.manythings.org), you will find that it loads up very quickly and is easy to navigate as well.  If you're into bright and hectic looking sites,
 though, this might not be the site for you.  A possible technical problem might occur if your browser isn?t java enabled.  I think by adding more CGI links/activities where you fill in the blanks would make up for the lack of java enabling capabilities. Overall it?s an excellent and user-friendly site.",5
800,Good references for the course on computer networking. ,4
801,I spent about 2 hours going through the material.  I found this article explains computer numbering formats with examples very well.  I think it is an effective learning tool and reference material for students who want to learn or review how numbers and text are represented on a computer.  It is also an excellent supplemental material to Computer Organization courses.Technical Remarks: The material is easy to use.  There are seven sections in the article.  Users can easily navigate from one section to another.,5
802,"This is an essential assignment for any graduate student who is contemplating doing research with human subjects. It offers a solid introduction to the issues for students and would be a good refresher for faculty. Most examples are from the sciences, but the historical examples are universal.

803,"Works smoothly, but not as versatile as others.",3
804,This presentation includes several useful examples Concept Maps that demonstrate how the tool can lead to deeper levels of processing by students. Also includes an overview of author's research of how Concept Maps enhanced student performance (especially among students with lower achievement scores) along anecdotal suggestions for how to introduce Concept Maps into a course through scaffolding techniques. Also explores strategies for how Concept Maps can be used to assess student learning and misconceptions. It is not immediately clear what the memory/application tasks toward the end of the presentation related to Concept Maps.  Overall this is a very useful introduction into the use of concept maps.Technical Remarks:Nice presentation with dual screens with the author and the PowerPoint. I also appreciate the author's use of a Tablet PC!,4
805,I thought this tutorial was very very good at covering the material.  I particularly liked the interactive questions and answers at the end.  I thought it did a very good job of reflecting on the material while still requiring the reader to use critical thinking skills.  I would definitely use this tutorial as a suplement to my lecture.,4
806,I spend 5 min looking at the site and I found that it is very instering and enjoyed looking at I thought that it had a lot to do with math but I didn't understand that math behind it was to advance and I felt that it wouldn't be useful for students in the sake of trying to learn something new     the site was very easy to use.,4
807,"On this site it teaches students how to make shapes within a circle.  It gives an example of a sixteen point circle, it illistrates steps, and also provides downloads to print your own blank circles to try on your own.  This site also has a section for students, it provides math buddies that you can communicate with through e-mail.  I would recomend this site for students who are struggling and seeking support.",4

811,"I spent about 30-45 minutes trying this out.  The item consists of four applets. The first represents cannon balls colliding with a railway car. The remaining three represent the collision of two railway cars, one of which is initially at rest.    The applets contribute little to the conceptual understanding of momentum or its conservation. Two can be used to test quantitative predictions, but only for totally inelastic collisions (assuming that the cannon ball collisions are totally inelastic, which is not stated nor subject to confirmation). The remaining two can be used as tests of students' ability to perform quantitative calculations involving momentum conservation in totally inelastic collisions. Two of the four questions with the first applet require only the ability to count; that is, no physics understanding is required on the part of the student. Furthermore, the lack of specification of units reinforces the undesirable tendency of students to ignore units.  Most annoyingly, some of the applets are VERY slow to develop.Technical Remarks: Two of the four applets do not load under Netscape Communicator (4.75) The motion of the rail cars is rather jerky under IE 5.5. ",2
811,Good applet with clean graphics. Having the mass and momentum variable is somewhat awkward.,4
812,"This lesson uses visualizer/document camera technology to support learning. The visualizer/document camera is used to visually demonstrate how to convert fractions into decimals and percents using both a calculator and pen and pencil. This helps support students as they prepare to attempt the task independently. This technology most definitely supports visual learners, and the large screen display may also serve as an assistive technology to students who may have special needs.Another strength of this lesson is that it uses a great attention-getting strategy of asking students to use fraction-decimal conversion skills to solve an authentic math problem involving candy.I was not familiar with Scholastic's Funny Bone series of books, but this lesson prompted me to learn more about the series on Amazon.com. Through these books, students use math to find the answer to a funny riddle. This activity in itself would be very motivating to students as it offers pleasant consequences (using math allows them to solve the riddle) and is a novelty (attention-getting and humorous).To improve this lesson, I would love to see more face to face instructional strategies being used. For example, BrainPop offers an educational video that could be used to introduce the topic, remediate as necessary, or to reach a wider variety of learning styles. There are also several engaging online games that could be used to practice these skills (One great example is found at http://www.mrnussbaum.com/death_decimals/index.html). Perhaps more advanced students could also be challenged with an additional task, such as creating their own riddles that must be solved by converting fractions to decimals and percents. The riddles they create could then be published on a classwebsite or blog.Technical Remarks:This lesson plan is easy to understand and use. There are no glitches in this material. The only technologies that needs to be available in the classroom to successfully implement the lesson are a visualizer/document camera and a projector.Please note that this lesson does require that teacher has access to Scholastic book - ""Decimals & Percents Practice Puzzles: 40 Reproducible Solve-the-Riddle Activity Pages That Help All Kids Master Decimals and Percents"" for student activity.",4
812,"This lesson meets the requirements of goal directed design and instructional design principals which is important for grasping, motivating and keeping students on track. There is a real world need addressed which is having students convert fractions into percents. I felt that the lesson could have begun by having a great introduction, such as asking students if they would like “1/2 a cup of pop, or 50% of the cup filled.” This would be a great way to get their attention, start an important conversion and get student’s interest. The objectives were stated in the beginning of the lesson, and students got a chance to take the information and apply it with a calculator and Jolly Ranchers, which address the UDL Principals. The material could have been presented in more ways, such as in a video from YouTube. There are many on YouTube that can be used in the classroom, and then the teacher can stop along the way to make teaching points. Having a calculator on the document reader is a good way to provide visuals for students, another UDL principal. I also did enjoy the way that the Scholastic riddles were incorporated and used in the lesson. It’s a great way to make fractions fun!Technical Remarks:The technology is pretty basic and easy to use for any teacher/student.  Only a document reader, screen and calculators are needed for this lesson.  This lesson does allow for more technology to be integrated and easily used as well. ",4

824,"Cathleen Sanders’ Creative Geometry Web site is a fantastic and easy-to-use site designed to enhance a completely engaging style of teaching.  Cathleen’s site gives ideas for learning through “hands-on” methods that encourage not only remembering, but understanding the geometrical concepts while creating a tangible piece of work. I spent almost two hours on this site and among many projects; I discovered how to make a three-dimensional Golden Spiral – the gorgeous lines of the seashell we find in nature.  While creating the project in folds, Cathleen instructs her students to use the Pythagorean Theorem to make calculations throughout the process.  Not only does the student get a sense of the math, they get a beautiful finished piece.  This was one of many of the origami and cutting projects I found on the Creative Geometry site.  

Another fantastic teaching idea I discovered on this site is The Shapes Game.  The Shapes Game is an ice breaker were students work in small groups.  While one student describes objects out loud, the others in the group try to draw what is being described.  This game encourages fun while getting students to give descriptions using technical terms that are employed throughout the class. This is an enormously effective site for teachers.  It makes learning fun and creative for everyone in the classroom.",5

827,"Over all, I like this set of tutorial modules. They are well designed but have what I consider some major flaws. The biggest problem is that some require the user to scroll up and down on a webpage while others do not. I believe the best design of such a tutorial should not require the user to scroll around when the browser displays full screen, roughly 400 by 800 pixels on most computers.Specifics:a. I spent two hours on this site going through all 9 modules. I spent additional time looking at the background material on the website.b. The content is high quality and presents commonly accepted concepts and models for doing information research. However, they do go into excruciating details in some of them. Such detail can lead to boredom very quickly.c. Appropriate use of this set of tutorials would enhance a classroom session on the same topics. They are not however sufficient to stand as an online course in their own right.Each module could be used as an additonal activity in an online or classroom based course.d. The tutorial modules are easy to use once you figure out the navigation buttons. It is obvious to me that detailed instructions would be needed to do this set. The instructions are not included on the site nor are they part of any of the modules. If I were allowed to change things here, I would:-- increase the size of the naviation icons.-- add instructions built into each module.-- decrease the level of detail.-- add more interactivity in the modules.-- do away with any scrolling up and down and left to right.There are better sites out there that accomplish the same task.

I also enjoyed the virtual tour of how to complete a beadloom, simshoban and cornrow hairstyles. This artwork may not be for everyone but it does apply to many cultures out there that could take this website and teach it to others. Technical Remarks: I began to do some beadloom, but got confused. I really need to dedicate a good amount of time into something like this. It was easy to browse this site and work with some of the numbers, but not all the angles were working for me, and that was probably because I was doing it wrong...(smile)",4
831,"This site was very interesting and fun!  It explains how math is in everyday things.  It focused mainly on African and Native American art and patterns within their art.  It has thousands of links and animated sites where you can go and build/create patterns similar to previous ones that they have already demonstrated.  If you have trouble with any one thing, they have links to pages that help you comprehend how to use the animated sites.  They also have tons of pictures and ideas.  I found this site fascinating and you will too!Technical Remarks: I found this site to have a new approach on math.  It was fun, exciting and worth learning or teaching!  It covers the geometry of repetition or patterns in African and Native American art.",5

Very basic lesson. May be able to extend the use of place value into expanded notation in addition as this is a concept that students struggle with. The use of the games at the end was very appealing and a fun way for students to review their knowledge of place value.Technical Remarks:There were no technical problems with this lesson - presentation format must have been changed to powerpoint show. Signifying the different ""periods"" with different colors for more visual awareness may help students see the pattern better. The slide that asked about 65,187.493 has an extra word in the question that you may want to go back and eliminate.",3
839,"I taught place value with my 3rd grade students this past school year (2010-11).  This would have been a great resource to have my students use and refer to when they were learning about place value and then to review the concept.  I liked the background and positive reinforcement when a question was answered correctly.  Additionally, it was encouraging when a question was answered incorrectly.  I also liked the links to the online ""games.""  The links were active and the games were engaging.  I think that the target age of elementary school students would benefit from this presentation.Technical Remarks:I would suggest perhaps changing the background or colors of the buttons in some of the slides to give it a little variety.  The initial explanation slides might also need to be slowed down.  There were a little fast to read.  Also, if the lines were entered through some animation, that might help to guide the students' eyes as they work through the project.  Finally, I had this issue as well because I do not use PowerPoint very much, you might want to change the presentation format and save it as a PowerPoint Show.  It is a .ppsx extension.  Otherwise, great job.",4

849,"This site was all about games and puzzles relating to math. For example, there is a problem.""  Another problem was called ""draw this"" this was really fun.  The computer software shows you a picture of a house with 5 points and asks you to draw it without lifting your pencil.  The software actually allows you to do it on the computer.  I tried about 5 times and didn't get correct, but I had alot of fun. The names of the puzzles reminded me of when I was little and played board games, names like chutes and latters, it was a way to show the average number of times it takes to play a game.Technical Remarks:The site was easy to use and gave coutless puzzles, patterns and games.  It wa set up like a table of contents or a chapter by chapter lay out.  I think this site is an excellent way to get students excited about math because it makes it look fun and approachable.  It makes math look like a game instead of a hard subject.  It is also easy to follow.  Teachers would find this site useful as well because it has some great examples on how to make math more fun and interactive.",5

The formula used to calculate each dose is accurate and the examples are also broken down into easy to follow steps. The use of colour coding also assist the user in following the step by step calculation. This material can easily be adapted for use in a medication calculation session and is one which students nurses will appreciate.",4
857,"This is a simple yet effective lesson plan on creating double bar graphs. The audienc is meant to be mid-elementary school students who have some experience with math already. One aspect I really liked about the presentation was that the eventual graphing program as stated in your technology needs was an online graphing web 2.0 application. Another aspect that I thought you excelled at was the motivation section. It is great when students can create their own work and make something that they can be proud of. I also liked the novelty section, where students will help the teacher initially to correct a badly set up bar graph. This will give students an extra bit of knowledge in doing their project. Some things that could be improved on would be some sepcific mentions about applications of UDL principals. For example, is this only going to be a lecture or are you going to use youtube tutorials as a secondary teaching method? I thought though that the teaching questions you asked were all very well written and would make the kids gain a lot of knowledge about graphing itself. Well done lesson plan!",4
857,In the instructional objective I like how you included the type of knowledge the student will need to know in relation to the universal design for learning. In this section you may also want to include NETS objectives or Common Core Standards that this lesson meets.I like that you have the students collect real and meaningful data from their classmates.This lesson should be relatively easy to implement in the classroom and technology lab.Technical Remarks:In the technology needs section I like the web site that the students can access. I like the demonstrations of how to create various styles of graphs. The video demonstrations will be helpful for students to learn at their own pace. They have the option to revie the material over and over if they don't understand the material. The audio and visual in the video will help all learners.,4

860,What a solid resource! I intend to use this and possibly order some materials for some hands-on science.,5
861,"A.I actually spent three hours reviewing this material in doing the puzzles that were presented on the project page. What i found interesting about these puzzles was that not only was  i vewing this material in a diffrent way. But i found that it helped me as well in understanding the methods behind fibonacci puzzles. As well as what the diffrent fibonacci numbers and i can use this source as a reference for when we go over the fibonacci in helping me with that chapter in answering the homeowrk questions.  
B.I definitatley feel that this page presents material that is educationaly significant for instance the first puzzle i worked on was that their are three ways to climb three steps. how many ways are there to climb four stairs, five stairs and n stairs. Even though the problem might be wriiten in an elementry way i feel that it makes u think about what are the fibonacci numbers and how to efffectively use them in a story problem. As well as a good introductry problem for a professor to use for students to grasp the idea behind what fibonacci numbers are. 
C. Its extremely effective in seeing how something as simple as puzzles can be converted in showing diffrent diagrams and unique story problems with the fibonacci numbers hidden inside the puzzles allowing u with the answers at the end of each story problem except u might need to look a little longer at the problems to figure out what the solutions are.
D. I dont think first time users would find this site useful beacuse in order to understand the story behind these puzzles u should have somewhat of a undrstnading of what fibonacci numbers or u are going to get frustrated and waste your time.",5

877,"I found the activities here very useful, especially the ""Warmer"" using the question ""What was the first thing you did today?"" My class of high-beginner, low-intermediate students enjoyed personalizing the responses. They at first guessed at some of the past tenses of irregular verbs, and looked them up when necessary. What started out as a warmup activity turned into a grammar lesson on the past tense, and later, the future. The students got involved in the lesson and enjoyed it more because it had relevance in their lives. Later, we used a variation on the question to study the present continuous tense: It is 3 p.m.     and I am (driving my children home).",4
878,This is an excellent introduction to the material.Technical Remarks:Well designed with clear instructions.,4
878,"This tutorial is thoughtfully well designed for improving understanding of a framework of teaching with the help of nicely implemented technology. I think that the topic could be broadly modified and customized according to multifaceted interpretations in diverse educational settings. Since visual information such as diverse icons are used to support delivery of knowledge, check-up practices, and quizzes, students are able to experience several types of feedback according to their performance levels. At the beginning of the tutorial, the author introduced the structure and the content of the tutorial clearly, which helps students pay attention to a step-by step approach to knowledge on a framework of teaching. The content flow is closely connected to the topic, and the interactive check-ups intend to activate knowledge and apply it to real world examples. The interactive quizzes are closely correlated with prior built-up knowledge, and students get immediate and guided feedback on their performance. It might be good to include more slides on some examples of each domain after explaining the four domains with words. I think that examples would be helpful for students to understand the four domains in real world situations, apply their understanding to quizzes, and expand knowledge on other cases.Technical Remarks:There were no big technical issues throughout the tutorial. Clear instructions and interactive mode make it easy for students to navigate the content. For each quiz, interactive feedback features are provided, which is helpful for students to complete the task until they get correct answers and comprehend the content. However, the video clip on the slide titled “Does good teaching look anything like this?” is not working. The author needs to check the embedded link. It might be good to add more images, pictures, audio- or video- materials to each domain as examples to support student understanding of the concepts more concretely. Also, it would be good to add highlighting effects to the texts.",4
878,"Overall a very effective and interactive tool with a clean inviting design and lay out. It was a joy to use it especially as the design provides many features in line with the UDL guidelines:Multiple means of Representation are mainly in providing options for comprehension through the supply of background knowledge, information processing, visualization and manipulation with the different knowledge input and checks leading toword the final quiz.Multiple means for Action and Expression; especially through varied methods for response and navigation as well as the use of multiple media for communication (pps, video, quiz, knowledge checks, link to external web site).Multiple Means for Engagement were featured in greatly recruiting interest from the first slide onward. Also it felt as no issue to sustain effort and persistence going through the tool. Different demands, questions and challenges kept me highly engaged. Particularly the fact that the deeper into the tool the more enthusiastic the feedback was which kept me ""glued"" to try the next check/test/question. Also the options for self-regulation were well designed especially in terms of self assessment and reflection through the knowledge checks and final quiz.Technical Remarks:Everything worked fine in terms of the navigation. There were just two things that didn't work as expected when I tried the tool:1) the ""good teaching"" video gave me a ""media not found"" response when I clicked on it.2) using the Exit button I could get into the development stage of the tool which enabled me to make any changes I wanted. From a security perspective that isn't desirable.Some possible suggestions for even further enrichment:a) a back button on each slide so it's possible to re-read the previous slide (which I tend to like once in a while)b) using sounds for the different buttons when clicked.",4

Specifications for element structure was presented in an easy-to-follow format that no one needs to be intimidated ever again!Technical Remarks:  An interesting hyperlink discusses 8 different element classifications and constructions methods.The Geometry Applet is what makes this a fun site by being able to see the results of proper construction and manipulations that do not always make sense initially. All of the books offer a Guide at the end of the discussion which suggests uses of the theorem or proposition by stating that these will form the basis of another proposition. Linking through the site was very easy. Models and figures for construction were colored or outlined and key vertices were highlighted by consistant color indicators.

The materials were written well for most people to understand, but knowing a bit of calc. will actually help to better understand the deeper concept of some materials. In addition, the site is easy to access, and the interactives were great also. ",4
896,"The video is great, but without accurate closed captioning, thus the video is not ADA compliant.
Auto-generated captioning, used in most YouTube videos, is inaccurate.
The video transcript starts off by saying ""Phase B ..."" instead of FASB.
As a community, we need to work toward accurate transcriptions for all of our videos to ensure our course materials are ADA compliant.  
Thanks for considering my suggestion,

898,"Fetal Echo materials for use in the classroom that are up to date and comply with new advances and guidelines are difficult to come by.  Dr DeVore's website is a treasure trove to present to the class.  Everything a student would want to see to learn a basic protocol is shown on this link.  This is a wonderful resource for any sonographer, medical student or ultrasound student.",5
899,"I used this material to improve my probability section in finite class. Although i visit this website since my instructor recommended for a couple month, i just became member today. This is a very good material and very useful. Recommended!!!",5
899,"I spent almost 45 minutes to familiarize my self with this webpage. I found it really useful because the flow of the presentation was precise, concrete , clear and very easy to follow.The materila help me the understand, analyse and read the materials in my own speed. The Chapter Quizes helped me to do my homework and the interactive quizzes with proper understanding.The search functionality provided by the website is really useful. As a new user, I used this functionality to locate my topics of interest very easily. Also I found that the support provided for was topic was good.The Chapter Summary section gave me a clear overview of what is being discussed in the chapter.Overall, this site is a very good resource for finite math students and it is very easy to browse through the valuable contents.",4
899,"My first impression of the Finite Math website is ""WOW""!  It took me less than 30 minutes of scrolling through the site to come to the conclusion that this was a well constructed site for helping students study and understand more fully about Finite Math. As a student in Finite Math, I found that the software is very user friendly and very helpful as a reference tool when I'm doing my homework. It's definately a useful resource especially if math is not your stronger suit as it is not mine.  The Chapter Review Exercises are pretty helpful though I would prefer that it explained/showed steps to get to the final answer.  All in all I think it's definately a resource for students who are having problems or those who would like to review ahead of class.  I think that this website should be more widely used and the link should always be given as a resource to students taking any sort of math class by their professors.",5
899,"In my opinion, this is a great resource for a finite math student. It took me less than 20 minutes of browsing to find such a useful website. I spent about 2-3 hours exploring the website to get to know the material well. I like this website for many reasons; the first reason is that it shows all the steps and explanations to solve a big problem such as: The Simplex Method, Matrix Multiplication, Matrix Addition etc. You can simply check your answer for a big problem, by just plugging in the equation into the software. I was having trouble working on a problem, but when I came across this website it gave me instructions on how to solve the problem step by step. There are also chapter quizzes and summaries that can help students in improving their math skills.  This is a great website for students who sometimes have trouble understanding the material in class. They can just go onto this website and understand the material very easily. There are also very great online tutorial on this website on Probability. If students needs to do some practice on Probability, they can just go on this website and explore the material. At last I would like to say that, it is a very useful website for finite math students and I recommend to every student.",5
899,"I spent a couple of hours browsing, reviewing, and testing my knowledge on this webpage and found it to be very useful. The site's outline 
closely mimics my current class outline and the concepts and information were clear, direct and easy to follow. It was helpful to see the material from an exterior perspective to reemphasize that my own understanding is on the right track. Although I do my assigned reading and homework, it was beneficial to review the material at my own pace and take the interactive quizzes.  The quizzes made review fast and fun and they also identified what I truly comprehend and where I'm struggling. Finite math is challenging for me and I thought
this site provided quality support to each topic.  The authors provided 
thorough summaries, review exercises, on-line tutorials and utilities to ensure a student's success. Students struggling with finite 
can use this site to get a better understanding of class material since everyone learns differently and they can go at their own pace. 
First time users will find the site easy to manuever through and will also be able to locate their areas of interest very quickly. The material is straightforward and presented
clearly with visuals and simple explanations.",5
899,"I wish I wouldve had more time to explore with this website before. I definitely felt that I have shortened my resources for learning Finite mathematics this semester. After browsing and using some of the tutorials for several hours, I have to say that the tools on this site are extremely helpful. There is almost no need for the book especially if students are on a budget; but, for those that do have the book this site is extremely helpful and provides further practice. Some of the tools that you can find on this site include: Chapter Summary's, Chapter True/False quizzes, Chapter Review Exercises, and Chapter Excel tutorials. With all these tools combined, your learning experience on this site would not only contribute to improving your grades, but improving your knowledge of applications to the real world. For students that do not have an interest in mathematics, this site helps build confidence and smoothens your learning experience in Finite Mathematics. The material presented on this site covered the material that was learned in my class, but might differ from other material that is learned in other finite classes. The site was very user friendly and made searching for topics very easy. I hope that future students in Finite Mathematics will utilize this site for all it has to offer. End the end, Im sure students will not be disappointed. This site is great!",5
899,"This is an outstanding resource for anyone taking Finite Math.  I wish I had longer to work on the site, but after 30 minutes, I found it to be an excellent resource. It offers so many useful tools, quizes and sample problems to enhance what you learn in class.  This is a great supplement to the classroom because teachers and first-time students can extend their learning through the contents from this user-friendly site. For example, the site allows you to pace yourself and spend the time you need to understand a concept.  It's a great way to focus and study for tests because there are sample problems to help you trouble-shoot the areas you need help with. 

Another benefit is that if anyone needs extra help with Finite Math, this site offers detailed explainations of formuals, problems and solutions to help your learning experience. I also think that teachers will find its contents helpful in their lesson planning. I can't say enough about Finite Mathematics, so go and explore the site for yourself!",5
899,"The finite mathematics article is an excellent area to go to study about finite math. I like this website for many reasons. One of the reasons is that I am studying finite math which it will help me in many ways. Another reason is that it has all the chapters I am studying in my class, and I can go to review each chapter that I need to improve more. I spend in this article about more than two hours because I was reviewing my previous chapters that I studied, and also I go over on chapter 8 and 9 because I need to understand more about these chapters. The most important that I found out about this article in that we can review all the chapters and it has a lot of information about each section. The article demonstrates the chapter summary, chapter true and false quiz, review exercises and Excel tutorials. This article can help the students to understand more about the sections from each chapters. This is a great website to study about finite math because its like going to school, but you learning in the internet. This article is useful tool review for an exam or to understand more about the subject. I really recommend this website to search about more finite math.",5

901,"I used this lesson as inspiration for a modified lesson. I also used lyrics to Gym Class Heroes' ""Stereo Hearts."" I set up the lesson as a debate. I assigned each song to half the class. The first round of the debate focused on sound devices. The second round focused on figurative language. At the end of the class, students submitted a ballot for the ""Pop Music Poetry Awards,"" voting for the song that they think is the best poem (they didn't have to vote for their assigned song). For their votes to count, students had to give examples of sound devices and figurative language from the lyrics. (I gave them space to do this on the ballot). I used the ballot as a formative assessment.",4

903,This website gets to the very specific demands of each discipline of science.  the only thing that is frustrating for me is while all of the other resources are free this one is based on sales.  The visual presentation and organization of information is aesthetically pleasing and easy to follow.  For me to pay money I think they would need to leave the sample time a little longer before it greys out with their buy it now option.,3
904,"There is a lot of really great content in the site and it's explained in a simple, easy to understand language. The only problem I have is that this is really text heavy and I think there are a lot of missed opportunites for a more visual presentation of content. When I saw the title flow of information I was expecting at least one info graphic demonstrating this flow. That being said I still recommend it because it's very comprehensive and a great resource for students and fellow librarians.",4

906,"Since this fractal program (a java applet) offers only two options - Mandelbrot and Julia sets - it does not take much time to explore, therefore, I spent only about 15 minutes using it.  I tried both sets and zoomed in and out on many different parts.  I am not an internet programmer and probably do not fully appreciate the work involved in java applets, but this seemed flawless and easy to use.  Anyone can use this software, easily and it is a good introduction to Mandelbrot and Julia set fractals.  Technical Remarks: I have long been a fan of fractal programs and I was glad to see this simple one here, however, it lacks depth.  I mean literally, you cannot zoom in very far before it loses detail.  The real beauty of fractals that I have seen in the past is that you can zoom in FOREVER and they become even more complex and surprising.  That was missing in this program and I was somewhat disappointed by that.  Otherwise, it is technically fine.",4
907,"This is a great idea to organize the differences and relationships between fractions, decimals, and percents! I think I could definitely use this in the classroom even with my fourth graders once they get a better handle on the conversion between fractions, decimals, and percents.I'm not sure if this was meant as review or an introduction, but it might have been better to use more scaffolding, like showing all the steps to get to each fraction/percent/decimals. I would have also benefitted from more pictures. I know from my past experience, it really helps to show me an image to remember fractions. There are some good visuals that also convey the percentage that is colored in. This would really help as a UDL principle. Bolding or using text features would have made vocabulary and important information stand out.Technical Remarks:Just a couple suggestions, I'm am not sure if all of the arrows were linked right, at one point it took me to an answers page before I had even viewed the questions. I also could not get the sounds to work when I clicked on the speaker.",3
907,"Overall, I found this to be a useful review of fractions, decimals, and percents.  I used this in my classroom and found it to be very engaging and useful.  I enjoyed the description of the various mathematical principles, and I found that they were very helpful for my students.  The quiz gave quick feedback to the students about what they understood and which areas they need more work on.  I felt the instruction was useful, however, I feel that pictoral representations of fractions, decimals, and percentages would have aided the understanding of the more visual students.Technical Remarks:Everything seemed to work well.  Some of my students found the sounds difficult to access, but it may have been a compatability issue with the computers they were using.",4
908,"A goldmine of resources here all complimentary. Perfect for using in classroom, training, workshop, etc. settings with clients and students.",4

916,"I love to learn about new people especially inventors who truly believe in something they enjoy. This man loved to learn about astronomy and mathematics. His passion about the outer space and math appealed to me. He enjoyed looking at the stars and he invented the telescope. The telescope was used by many ships at sea. I have been on a ship before and that was interesting to me. Also, he explored some of the planets that we know today. I also learned that he was the man who said that the earth rotates around the sun. During his adult life this became a serious issue to people at the time. Many people couldn't see through his eyes and didn't believe him. If you are someone who enjoys looking at the stars througha telescope then you will enjoy reading about this man.  And, if you are someone who needs information about astronomy then this site will help you to write your paper. Also, you can look up other inventors in science and math for your interests.Technical Remarks: While I was reading this site there was no technical problem at all.  The site didn't disconnect and black out. It was very easy to go on the other links listed towards the end of the page. And, it was easy to get it on the screen and to go back to the previous screen.",3
916,"Galileo has been a person of fascination for me ever since the 8th grade when I wrote a report on his life accomplishments. During my higher education, I came back to Galileo for an essay on the topic of religion and politics.
I spent about 25 minutes reading the biography and exploring links. I found most of the content to be educationally useful, and some that was not. For example, ""Paris street names"" of mathematicians is not very important in the realm of education. Otherwise, links such as ""cross references"" provide useful avenues for exploration.
This material definitely has the potential to enhance teaching/learning through useful links and ease of layout and navigation. Students can find a wealth of information, from primary sources written by Galileo himself to historical topics regarding theories of gravitation.
First time users will have no problems navigating the material. Links are thoughtfully laid out in a manner that is easy to comprehend.
I recommend this site to everyone!",4
916,"This biography is brief, but the website does provide other sites that can be accessed for additional information.  I reviewed this material for about thirty minutes to discover more about Galileo Galilei and to determine if I could use any of the information for my current math class.  Since a source for this information was provided, it appears that the material accurately presents the story of Galileo Galilei's life. The biography points out that Galileo Galilei formulated the basic law of falling bodies.Technical Remarks:If students want to learn more about the life of Galileo Galilei, this website could be used for research or use in the classroom.",4
916,very interesting biography of galileo and theres also links for further information... great amount of information that is reliable.,4
916,"As i browsed through the site, i noticed that the site's contents were filled with a lot of information regarding Galileo Galilei, seeing this i knew that this would be a good site for sources on a presentation, or writing reports about him. I liked how they provided extra links about Galileo, and how they added letters, confessions, and awards about Galileo. In terms of technicality, with using this website, i say its very easy browsing, like reading through an article post, or like an online encyclopedia.",4
916,"This is awesome! If I had known about this site, I could have done better on my first midterm paper for math! A lot of the sites I visited doing my research was chaotic. This site definitely breaks down Galileo--without the fuss. I didn't have to read through paragraphs to find what I'm looking for. This would have made my research a lot easier :( I wish I had known about this earlier. The books were helpful, but this site contains 174 books/articles! I can't believe I sat through 3 hours of research sitting in a library when I could have done this at home!

Students who are looking for information on Galileo will definitely find this site helpful. It is organized and clean. I truly appreciate the work that had gone into the site. I actually spent half and hour reading through some of the articles. This is really cool, I'm definitely returning later.",5
916,Nice website. I appreciate the use of primary sources.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate. Very simple.,4
916,"It's too bad Galileo Galilei was condemned for all he did. I spent about 25 minutes reading through this site and thought all the information was helpful and enjoyable. The material in this site is accurately presenting he concepts the models that are educationally ignificant. It is serving a great education tool and also it is helpful for us who are learning and to those who are teaching. Lastly, this site is very easy to use and anyone can take advantage of this site for learning purposes.",5
916,I spent some time clicking through some of the information on this site and found that there are very interesting and helpful sections and I think this site has a lot of useful information on  Galileo and his accomplishments amateur but it needs to be updated visually. It looks very  which makes it appear like it is less credible that other sites. But because of it simplicity it is very easy to browse through. I can see how this would be helpful if a young student was doing a research paper on the philosopher or a project on Italian mathematicians.,3
916,"This site is very helpful. It helped me learn more about a person I know little of. He was a great philosopher, mathematician and an astronomer. We see his works in our daily life today, especially the telescope. It opened doors from Hubble space telescope to giant observatory telescopeTechnical Remarks:i like the fact it has many links that took me to other site about the topic and also has references where information is from but the page is a little dull it lacks color and interactive.",4
916,"I really like this article about Galileos life because it gives many important points about math and astronomy. Galileo was a great mathematician for many reasons. One of the reasons is that he discovered the method of finding specific gravities. By using his math skills, he developed the lenses of his telescope to see the sky, which he discovered many important objects in the sky. He discovered Jupiters moons, the sun is in the center of the galaxy, Milky Way, and the infinite universe.  With his math skills, he discovered how to measure the distance in the sky. When I finished reading the article I learned a lot about how people in the past used their math skills to discovered new subjects about our planet, and other planet in our galaxy. This article explains how we can use our math skills in different areas no matter what is the subject because we use math all the time. For example, this article described how a great mathematician uses his skill to discovered new planets and objects in the sky. This article helped me to understand more about math and astronomy as the same time; and also helped me to learn more about math so that the way I can use my math skill in the future. I really recommended to read this article about Galileos life and understand more about math and astronomy subjects.  The article is long, but it is very interesting subject about math and astronomy.",4
916,This site is very well researched considering Galileo's life and all his accomplishments. However I dont think alot of this information is nessesary and can be compiled into smaller tid bits such as his life and how he grew up. I would have much rather read alot about his mathematical contributions and what he basically became famous for in math. I didnt really need to know about his love for music and then having to read on until much later down the page where he finally wrote a book. ,4
916,"Galileo struck me as an intresting topic because of his passion for math/science as well as his passion for religion.  If anyone has done even a little bit of research they would know that math/science mixes with religion as well as oil and water.  To see his take on the religious aspects in addition to the mathematical side puts his whole view into another category.  I spent about 10 minutes reading this article, but I tried to pull out the ""meat"" of the article.Technical Remarks: The biography of Galileo was very intresting, but I felt it was a little overwhelming.  They included a lot of unneccesary information (at least for this assignment).  I would have liked for them to go more into the content of what he accomplished rather than short overviews.  The article was still very intresting.",3
916,"Thissite would seem to be very well researched.  There are little tidbits about Galileo that I never knew, some interesting tidbits about his childhood, how he almost didnt become a mathemetician. Y ou can tell that the writer did his research, but the page is a little dry, too factual. THere is a lot of interesting information, just not conected in a very conversational way.",4
916,"Galileo Galilei is a brilliant man he has developed many scientific and mathematical achievements, from his theory of motion to his early work with astronomy and telescopes its all here. This web site offers a lot of information; it presents a background of his life as well as a brief explanation of his family?s life. It covers his life and achievements in order of when it happened starting from his childhood a following him until is adult years. It explains a few of his concepts, but they are difficult to understand simply because the level of material is at a skilled level. But for those who don?t mind reading and rereading, this site has a lot of interesting information to show. It is useful as a math or history resource.",3
916,"Since I am doing my final paper on Astronomy, this page on Galileo was the first thing that caught my attention. I printed out the page so that I can high light what I thought would be useful while I skimmied the reading. I did that for about 15 minutes. I was really surprise to find out so much information about Galileo that I didn't know before. The information was more in depth than any text books I have read. I think this was a great page for people who want to do more research on Galileo. There was a lot of information but it was written in a simple language for anyone to understand. As a first time user myself, I can say that this website was really easy to use.",4
916,"This was one of the first sites I visited when I was introduced to Merlot in early November.  I spent a long time reading and learning about Galileo.  I have always been fascinated by what he did -- and admittedly, didn't know about much of what he did until I read this.  My husband loves the stars and thinks he can identify every start in the cosmos.  It's interesting to me how wonderful astronomy and the work of Galileo touch peopTechnical Remarks: Very easy.  I didn't realize until afterward that this site was managed/written by the previous one I had visited.  ",5
916,I spent about 45 minutes reading through the article and found it very interesting.  Why?  When I was younger used to hear of Galileo because of a program at NASA.  I had not known the significance of what Galileo did in the developing of math and science used today.  Now knowing his back ground and all he did I can relate it to the NASA program that was exploring space and galaxies. ,4
916,It was very interesting to learn more about Galilel Galileo. It is interesting how math and astronomy always tie into together.I learned about Galileo and his discoveries of the solar system and his modles of the solar system. It was interesting to see that this man was the inventor of the telescope and he even studied medicine.He changed the world with his discoveries and he was thinking about things nobody ever thought about.The information was very interesting and detailed. It took me about 45 minutes to navigate through all of the remarkable information which is not that long taken to accord all this mans astonishing accomplishments. Technical Remarks: It was very easy to navigate through although this alot of information to read through. Very easy to go through.,5
916,this site like the site on Newton was also very interesting to read because of the history and how things developed in the unviverse.  from the history and all the data we can see how the developement of the properties and theories came together from one genertaion of atronomers to the next in order to have our solar system finally understood today.  the development of the telescope was giant step and the data collected by Galileo were great parts of the foundation of today.  this would be useful for reports since it's very simple and easy to read and had links to other site with further information to continue the whole history of the universe.  i think this is a good source for teaching and learning.,4
916,"I spent about 40 minutes reviewing this website. It was a pleasure reading Dr. O'Conner's paper on Galileo Galilei.     I knew that he was an astronomer; but I had no idea of his other accomplishments. For example,his design of a pendulum clock.  I learned interesting things about Galileo. He was born in Florence in 1564. As a young boy he was educated in a monastery. He studied medicine ;but this was not his true passion. His son Vincenzo tried to make a clock using his Father's plans- but failed.     This paper can definitley be used to increase ones' knowledge of Galileo. It does take patience to get through some of the material.Technical Remarks:     I experienced no technical problems. This site contained no applets.",4
916,"On this site I spent about 35 min.  I heard of Galileo before and studied him in my astronomy class, and this site was great. It talked about how he invented the telescope and how he used math to chart his findings in outerspace.  I never knew before that Galileo studied medicine.  I really wish I would have know of this site when I was taking my astronomy class it would have been very helpful.  I think it would work great in the class room or as a reference. Technical Remarks: It was really easy to use this site.  I had no problem finding it and browsing around it.",5
916,"It took me almost an hour to go over the whole article. However, this is a short amount of time to learn about the life and work of a well known scientist. I read this article when I was writting a research about Galileo Galilei, and this article helped me a lot in organizing my ideas. I also took a look at other articles about Galileo, but they are not as well informed and presented logically as this article. The content of this article is various and educational. It supports us not only the relationship among Galieo with his family, collgues and society, how they affect his career and work, but also his great accopmlishments in modern sciences. His contributions to science - formulation of the laws governing failing bodies, the invention of the telescope, the discovery of the isochronism of the pendulum, and numerous astronomical discoveries-  has made him become the father of mathematics and modern physics. Finally, if you are doing a research or gathering information about Galileo or history of mathematics, this article is the best choice. The article is written in time order, so it is easy to collect the ideas you need. It is also acessible and has many images and links, which relate to other topics and mathematicians.",4
916,i spet 25 min and this was ok. i have heard about galileo before.  i have his name in sicence class.  it seems like he had a lot of different personailtys.Technical Remarks: i thought it was interstesting but i need a little help with this.,2
916,"This was one of the best articles I have read since I started exploring the merlot site. I spend around an hour reading what the authors had to say and browsing the many different related links. It was particularly facinating to me to learn of Galileo's discoveries of our solar system and also his invention of the telescope. The content quality of this website was exceptional in my opinion and it could definitely benefit students to visit. I'm almost positive that it would enhance a student's learning to visit this site and it would really help faculty teaching to visit it as well. Technical Remarks: This is a very user friendly site. It has many different links throughout the reading, as well as a nice assortment of links at the bottom of the page. ",5
916,"I reviewed the materials by browsing, and looking through and trying things. Theres a lot of info on this site. Yes this site gives concepts that are significant, like about him, background, what types of math, etc.I do think that students will learn from this, but it has to be taught in the right way.Yes first time users will find it easy, because I am a first time user and I'm doing just fine.",4
916,"This was a very enjoyable trip into the life and times of one of the world's most interesting explorers of science and mathematics.  I spent the entire afternoon, not only studying this fascinating article about Galileo, but also going from web site to related web site in search of more facts about this most gifted man.  The material presented by Dr. O'Connor and Professor Robertson accurately reflects the many interesting and revolutionary contributions made by Galileo as well as his controversial and unpleasant problems with the Catholic Church.       Galileo was the first European to make systematic observations of the heavens by menas of a telescope and made many remarkable discoveries:  mountains and craters on the moon, four moons revolving around Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and sun spots.  His published observations probably did more to make Europeans aware of the new picture of the universe than the mathematical theories offered by Copernicus and Kepler.  His scholarly treaties were written in Italian rather than Latin, making them more widely available to the public, which no doubt alarmed the church authorities.     The authors of the article go into great detail explaining the problems of the church and its inability to accept the true meaning of Galileo's discoveries.  I do believe, however, that they could have spent more time detailing how the condemnation of Galileo by the Catholic Church seriously hampered further scientific work in Italy, which had been, up to that point, at the forefront of scientific innovation.     This article would be very appropriate for use in most math classes and it is one of the best written about the details of Galileo's life while studying mechanics after he was placed under house arrest by the church.  Technical Remarks:      The access to this site was really easy and the reader is automatically drawn to the many related web sites offered at the end of the article.  The best by far are ""The Galileo Project"" and ""The Mathematical Discovery of Planets.""",5
916,I spent 30 minutes browsing through the material on Galileo.  He was very brave to tell others of his findings regardless of the conseguences he could have faced during those times.  The material was very interesting explaining the discoveries he had made with his telescope.  A student could certainly use the material for a research paper or presentation.  ,4
916,"The St. Andrew's site for Gallileo gives a well rounded picture of this groundbreaking scientist, and is very simple to use, even for me. This is for the most part a biography given for the purpose of understanding the scientist's background for his work. The page is filled with maps to understand the region, and historical backgrounds to understand the time and place that Galileo was brought up in, and came to intellectual maturity in. Many essays serve as links and are full of fascinating, useful, and well written articles. I spent a medium ammount of time (oh, say 25 minutes) reading said articles, and gathering a broad picture of the man, his historical controversies, and his theories, experiments and discoveries. There is not much in the interactive category, but I was not looking for it, rather looking for information and background, and I recieved much. I think the collection of essays presented here are a fine guide to teaching the work of this important figure. All should find access to these pages easy, as they are mostly just essays.",4
916,"This was a very interesting and enjoyable article to read.  Even though Galileo studied medicine, he is remembered for his work on the telescope and theories of space.  Galileo believed that everything revolved around the sun.  Most of the astronomers at the time believed that everything but the earth and moon goes around the sun which, in turn, goes around the earth.  His teachings and lectures disagree with the standard of society. Galileo continued to write and smuggled out his articles outside the country.  Learning about Galileo in public school centered on his invention of the telescope and not his troubles with the scientific community at the time, which this article pointed out.  I gained a lot of insight into the life of Galileo that I did not know.  I connected to the various links to other sites about his life because the article was very interesting.        ",5
916,"I spent thirty minutes looking through this site and reading some of the reference material on Galileo Galilei. It was amazing to discover all of the faces of Galileo as a professional musician, a mathematician, a science philosopher, an astronomer and also a physician. This site if very informing and has tons of detailed information on Galileo. This is a great reference site for students wanting detailed biographical information on Galileo and his accomplishments. The content of this site and its links is very complete. This site is definitely a great resource for students as well as teachers to enhance the concepts and knowledge of Galileo and his life accomplishments. The material presented on this site is very user friendly, although I did come up to a link that was not accessible. I as a student would definitely use this site as a source if ever writing a paper on early astrologers or Galileo specifically.",5
916,"I spent an hour between browsing the Merlot website and reading this article.I've always wanted to know what really had happened to Galileo Galilee after his historical discovery in 1632.  Galilee was and will always be a symbol of courage to those who seek the truth and examine the facts carefully, and to those who are not afraid to show the world a better way to advance and achieve. Not only his discovery to the Earth's motion had ignited the courage in other scientists to move forward and accomplish amazing discoveries by which this generation is greatly benefiting from, but also his faith in changing the world and his readiness to take the next step while many at his time preferred not to do so, that kind of courage, had given us today, what we are proudly have achieved.One thing, more or less, have stuck in my mind as I was reading the article, the author is quoted to say:""There eventually followed some expression of interest by the Inquisition. Prima facie, Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of secret, but official, warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism.""For being a student of different religions, I beg to differ, and I wish to be corrected if I were wrong. In the Old Testament, in Isa. 40:22 the passage states that the Earth is circular. ""Khoog"" in Hebrew. That shows that the scriptures were not in conflict with Galilee's discovery, instead it shows that the Church authorities at the time were very ignorant of their own theology!I have greatly benefited from the article knowing for the first time that Galilee was a Mathematician as well as an astronomer and philosopher.",4
916,I started with it in mind to just take a quick look around. I ended up taking quite a while looking through this web site. I loved that it had a lot of interesting parts to keep my intrest. I think that this is a great website to find a plentiful amount of information.,4
916,"The materials I read on Galileo Galilei was very interesting and educational indeed. I told myself that I was just going to take about five minutes to browse through the site but the more I looked around, the more I was fascinated into the reading of important people in math history like Isaac Newton and Mr. Galilei himself.     On the quality of content, I felt that the site covered it well. What I liked about the readings on Galilei was how there are links that you can click on pertaining to a connection on the material being read. For example, Galileo talked about how he was a ""Copernican"" (believer in the theories of Copernicus). You can click on ""Copernicus"" link and magically you will be informed on the theories of Copernicus.    Indeed the potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning will be enhanced. If a site can offer great material for research, a network for people with the common interest, and easy to use, than this is the only site people need!",5
916,"It took me about 5 minutes to go into the link of the article of Galileo.  It was easy to read and there was useful material such as the links that were included for further research on this ""nobleman of Florence"".  Interesting to know that he was a professional musician, and he studied medicine, matematics and philosophy.  Overall it was exellent.  One of the sites ""The matematical discovery of planets"" was really interesting and usefull.Technical Remarks: It was really easy to access to this article.",5
916,"I was looking for something interesting to read, when I came alone the Galileo Galilei. I've been a fan of astronomy since I was young. Learning about the history of Galileo was amazing to me to find out that he was a great mathematician, along with a science philospher & an astronomer. The potential effectiveness of the information was great. This will allow students to gather information for homework and projects. The material on the site was easy once you've been in a few times.",3
916,"Within a few mintues, it felt as if i was back in my astronomy.  I remember most of the information that had read.  If i was had to do an essay in my astro class this site would have been really helpful & this site would have been helpful to me when i was taking the astro class.  The information that was giving would have been a good way for me to study for my astor class.  The content is the same as the text book that i used in class so not much of the content was hard to read.  Yes this site would have help enhance my learning if i had knew about this site a year ago.  The material that was giving was easy to remember maybe because i had already learn it. Anyways only if i knew about this site before it would have help me got an better grade in that class.",5
916,"I spent about ten minutes reading about Galileo and really enjoyed learning about his contribution to math. He would be a great choice for a math report because of the math history. This site provides many easy to use links as well, which would help in providing information for any type of research. This is a great site and I highly encourage the use of it, especially if you are a history buff. ",3
916,"IT ACTUALLY TOOK ME FOR ABOUT FIFTY MINUTES READING IT. THIS SITE WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME. IT CONTAINS SOME OF GENERALLY SIGNIFICANT CONCEPTS WHICH ABOUT PHYSICS, MATHEMATICS AND GALILEO'S BACKGROUND AS WELL. IT IS REALLY HELPFULFOR US WHO ARE TEACHING AND LEARNING ABOUT SCIENCE.Technical Remarks: THE ORGANIZATION OF THIS SITE IS VERY WELL.",5

919,"Great genetics website to understand the basic principles of genetic, along with how to apply it. I like how there are quizzes to test for understanding.",4
919,This website is great for students who struggle with genetics. Good explanations and having the quiz with answers is great for the students to work out.,4
919,This is a great site that can be used to introduce to children as early as elementry.  Monohybrid crosses are easy to understand and to follow.  ,4
920,This is an excellent resource for parents of deaf and hard of heairng infants and children. It has valuable links to resources for parents and professionals. The writing is very clear and very easy to read and navigate through.Technical Remarks:Very clear and easy to uae. Nice graphics.,5
921,"The material seemed up to date. A very wide selection of topics, from SNPs to astrobiology.",5
921,Great information. Plenty of colorful pictures and extremely detailed videos. This site is perfect for biology students.,5
921,There is a really good simulation that shows the scale of the molecules that make up DNA.,4
921,"In addition to spending some time on the other sites, I really went through the information on cloning.  The thing that I liked the best about it was that the concepts were explained in clear English (without jargon) and the follow-through activity allowed students some real experience.  I look forward to using this in my classroom next year.Technical Remarks:Although some of the other reviewers mentioned broken links, I did not see any.",5
921,This will be fun. I saw an other one like this using split peas.,5
922,I give one star because it is the lowest rate. I'd give none. It doesn´t work on my windowslaptop.,1
923,I found this one to be VERY interesting. It provided many different examples of higher level geometry and it provides a nice visual display to explain the concepts. I think this would be a very useful tool for students to learn more about this level of geometry.,5
924,"1. How you reviewed the materials (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing, 2 hours trying it, or actually use it in teaching-learning activities?). I spent about 40 minutes reviewing Professor Calter?s website and taking notes. 2. The quality of content (Does the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) I found the material to be intensely interesting because I love learning about the connections between art and other disciplines, most notably mathematics and architecture. As far as I could tell the material accurately presented concepts and models that were educationally significant. The topics that were of particular interest to me were the Golden Ratio, Roman Architecture, and Perspective. 3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning (If used appropriately, will students' learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?) I definitely think that if used appropriately student and faculty?s teaching would be enhanced by looking through the material presented on this website. It certainly helps to have at least a modest understanding of college level mathematics, however the interested student could still benefit. I liked that Prof. Calter included a lot of pictures with his notes. When describing art it is always best to have a visual reference. Technical Remarks: 4. The ease of using the materials (Will first time users find it easy to use the software?)I found the material was quite easy to use. The text was easy to read and understand, and even if a user doesn?t have much experience with computers, the website was quite user-friendly. ",4
924,"I spent 5-10 min. reviewing this link and to be honest, I was disapointed.  Although the cover pictorial was great there was not enough information and material provided that could be used as a learning/reference tool.  Technical Remarks: Possibly I had trouble with this link.  Everytime I clicked on the appropriate icons, the page would freeze.  Very frustrating as this is a subject that I would really like to explore in more detail.",2
925,"A good start, but basic entry level work. Students should be encouraged to go deeper with the math.",3
926,"Great for learning about diabetes. Gives all sorts of information about diabetes, causes and effects.",5
927,"Web site seems to be very inclusive in scope.  It would garner five stars if the applets ran a little smoother and it was clearer  as to what they demonstrated.  For those taking the time to examine this site in detail, it is highly recommended.",4
928,Simple animation illustrating basic concept of fermentation. Use in class every semester.Technical Remarks:Requires Shockwave.,4
928,I am planning on using this animation in lecture next week.  I like the way it takes into account how the cell gets rid of the elctrons on the NADH. ,4
929,The animation is basic and does not confuse student with details before they grasp the basic concept. Very clear and well done Use in class every semester.Technical Remarks:Requires Shockwave,4
930,"I really like the concept of bringing in more technology to learning a new language. There is so much out there tht can be used, even with the younger students. The lesson plan seems like a good start, but it is lacking the detail another person would need to use this plan in their own classroom. For example,  under instructional objective, it says to offer more tools to the students, but what specific tools is it talking about? Would a specific tool be used for recalling facts, applying pronciples, or performing (speaking) tasks? What kind of powerpoint presentatins will the teacher create? What is the reasoning behind them? What types of activities are going to need to be scaffolded for the students to be successful?The internet will motivate some students, but what if the student is highly distracted? Will that help or hinder them if they are playing on the internet instead of doing the lessons? What are some of the other pedagogies you will employ to help those students with other types of disabilities?Great start, but I think it can use a bit moe detail for others to be able to use this idea in their own classroom.Technical Remarks:There were no technical issues with this document, however, there were no links to try to open.",3
930,"This lesson plan gave your readers a good overview of what your classroom looks like on a daily basis.  You use various collaboration activities and presentations to motivate student learning on the internet, and you use various assessment tools.My Questions:How do you use UDL strategies to foster student learning?Specifically, how do you scaffold your hearing and/or vision-impaired students?What specific websites do you use for teaching Mandarin Chinese?What specific presentation tools do you allow students to use in your classroom?The design of this lesson plan is easy to follow and gives a clear picture of the framework used in this classroom.  However, I would like to hear more about what happens in one specific day.  What technologies do students utilize on the Internet?  Do they use their required microphones to create voice threads?Technical Remarks:There are no links given on this website to rubrics or resources. The link from MERLOT to the material itself works well on both a PC and a MAC.",3
931,"The important of this content for students is supportive for them to grow into well rounded adults. Connecting technology of RSS feeds, online articles, and websites help to make the students aware that the need of geography is a daily lifeskill.Technical Remarks:The geography website is appropriate for many abilities since online search and quizzes about geography can be at different levels.    The site was very easy to search through and was fast to load.",4
931,"Like I said earlier, this is a very interesting lesson! Students should be engaged when doing it.",5
932,"The lesson is excellent! It got my interest! I think it's perfect for 7-12. It may be a little difficult for the 6th grade, especially if they haven't taken Spanish at the elementary level. The article was long - especially for beginners, but on the whole it was a great lesson!quality of content - 5potential effectiveness - 5ease of use - 5Technical Remarks:Two links were broken",5
932,Helpful material for Spanish students of basic and intermediate levels. Nice pictures and well developed exercises.,4
933,"Great Job!  I see that you used google docs.  I think this was a wonderful lesson.  I believe that this was well thought out and planned.  I think this is something that all teachers need to do with their students, i think that the students think we are to hard on them when were grading but if their peers or classmates grade it and its the same result maybe they will try harder next time",5
933,This is a well thought out and written lesson plan. I would if I were a teacher utilize this lesson in my classroom.,4
934,"This is a terrific lesson.  I like that the kids can work ahead or stay at the pace set by the instructor.  Another positive is that students have the opportunity to discover things for themselves.  Multiple means of representation (video, audio, written word) and assessment are used (multiple choice, hand-written, cut and paste).  The lesson is informative, yet fun.Technical Remarks:No broken links.  Perhaps you could change the address to the video link.  The site used is distracting.  http://www.commoncraft.com/search",5
935,"I have been using this app since January 2012 and am extremely pleased with how I have been able to create more teaching time in my class periods because it only takes seconds to take attendance now. Being able to see students' photos is a plus. And being able to send student reports ""on the spot"" via my iPad to specific students as needed allows me to address students' needs much more promptly.",5
935,"This  app not only kept my classes organized on my iPad, but allowed me to learn student names quickly after I snapped their photo with my iPad 2 on the first night of class.  What I most love about this App is that the creator (Eric Lombardo) is always looking for ways to enhance it, and is very supportive when you have questions or concerns.  It's improved so much just in the year that I've owned it.Technical Remarks:Apple iOS only",5
936,"This StAIR has a good visual layout, and the way it presents information is clear.  However, the use of powerpoint animation was problematic (except in one way, noted below).  Animations that roll out text assume the student is reading at a particular speed.  I found this very distracting while I was taking in the core information being offered.  The same issue exists when the lecture is revealing sample problems and answers (such as the graphs).  The problem or answer was either being revealed too quickly, or I was waiting for it.  If text or problems need to be revealed on the same slide, I would like to be told ""click to continue"", and have the text, problem, or graph revealed.The quiz had a functionality issue where it was unclear where to click to select an answer.  This may be a powerpoint-specific issue.  I would recommend putting the clickable buttons separate from the answers (they were laid under the answers, which may have caused the problem).  In its current form (6/24/2012), there were only small slivers of clickable space.The one area I thought the reveal animations really did work to benefit the material was on a new slide revealing a new quiz question.  The quiz questions offer good feedback for wrong answers.  One had a link to a Khan Academy video, I would recommend linking more feedback to such relevant videos for reinforcement/remediation if they exist.The lecture portion could benefit from an audio reading of the text, as per UDL.Overall, well done.  After some tweaking, this will be an extremely solid and useful resource!",3
937,"Not only includes the addition, but also the subtraction, of vectors.  Worked very well.",4
938,"A good description of gravity, along with activities aimed at the elementary school level.  The example scenario of weightlessness (plane in a dive) was hard to visualize, and I am sure kids will have a tough time with it too.",4
939,The website for the personality test was very acurated. It could be a good source for faculty.Technical Remarks:Easy to follow. Technology was very easy.,4
939,"The information is high quality and has valuable potential to enhance learning. I plan to use this material in the future for an information resource. Thank you. Technical Remarks: The site is a bit difficult for a beginning computer user, but once you move around just a little, it is easier to understand how it all fits together. ",4
939,I reviewed the materials by looking at the subjects on the site and using the personality tests. I thought the quality was good but I think it's more geared towards teachers and graduates. I did however find it very easy to use.,4
939,"I found this site informative and easy to navigate. Many theories of personality are addressed, such as attatchment theory and behavior genetics.  I spent at least an hour browsing through the material.  The quality is accurate, and is applicable to the understanding of personality.  I found this site to be useful in my studies of abnormal psychology, I will most likely use it in adjunct to my studies.  ",4

945,There is interesting content on this site BUT it is mixed with horrific advertising and poor web page design.,1
945,"I really enjoyed reading through this website.  It is quite lenghty so it took me nearly an hour to read through it, but it was worth it.  It explains all aspects of stress including what it is,what causes it, how to detect it and how to decrease or control it.  The information was very informative and accurate.  I graded myself on the stress scale and guess what?  I am stressed!  That came as no surprise to me though.  Everyone deals with stress at some point.  That's why I think this article is beneficial to anyone.  This article helps people not only gain further knowledge about themselves, but gives an insight into how one can decrease their stress or prevent it.  I really like the way it focuses on self- realization.  It makes a reader really think about their life and how they can change.     I Think this would be a good resource for a techer to use.  It doesn't read like a textbook.  It fully explains all aspects of stress.Technical Remarks: I would reccomend this article to anyone, teacher or student.  It is easy enough to understand for a person just learning about stress and yet detailed enough for someone who knows just about everything about stress.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone who thinks they know everything about stress learned something new from this article, whether it be about stress in general or themselves.",5
945,"This is a website that makes learning about stress easy for anyone, including those of us who are not familiar with all the technical stuff . I spent half an hour or so looking around it various parts and found that each section offers the user simple explanations of complicated biological stress processes within the body. This site can help you recocgnize stress in your life and how you can reduce the amount you feel as wellas the amount you cause others. As the site explains, its important for everyone to learn how to handle stress properly to ensure better health and happiness.  ",4

The price is right (free for non-commercial use) and the program is comprhensive and well documented.2. The quality of the content is not really an appropriate category unless we are talking about the design of the program (which is excellent).3. This is a great tool for students in teacher education programs who want to build their own teaching and learning web sites.  If we think about this as a tool for the resolution of a problem, such as building a website that will help students learn, then it is terrific.4. My students were able to build fairly advanced site (considering their low incoming skills).  ",5

966,"Very good resource to identify some important questions that faculty and designers should keep in mind during course development. Important focus is given not to the tools, but to the outcomes of the course, the experience of online learning and participation, and structure of the course. The questions included in this resource may help faculty develop clearer ideas for their approach to hybrid course design. These questions would also be very appropriate to drive discussions in a faculty development workshop/training.",5
967,"I spent a good half an hour playing with the materials. The kali wallpaper patterns were very fun to play with. I made hperbolic triangles, looked at the lorenz simulation, and made different patterns and wallpapers. I read the mathamatical explinations and formulas that were used to make the simulations, but I didnt see one for the Kali patterns. Under the link it explains that the patterns are created illustrates the planar symmetry groups, however when I click the link there is not explination to WHAT planar symmetry groups are, only instructions on how to use the program. The simulations will help people understand the mathamatics covered, with explinations and interactive tools. Its great for someone who does better with visuals than with written down facts. It was extremely easy to use the materials you wouldnt have to read all the instructions, just click and you'll figure it out.",4
968,"This is a subset of the HyperPhysics web site. It is a reference on introductory physics concepts related to acoustics and human hearing.

970,"I spent 2-3 hours browsing through a variety of good material that I thought could be useful for several courses in an interior design program. The materials I found were all under civil engineering.  Finding the material could have been difficult and possibly discouraging to a regular student.  However, once you got a feeling for how the site works, navigating it was fine.  The site itself is treated as a building/engineering/architectural site but it is quite informative for faculty and students in an interior design program of study.  I never got to the earthquake demonstration; it would have taken another 2 hours.If used appropriately, the site has the potential of enhancing teaching and learning.  Teaching because of the resources available in a single site, learning because of the richness of the material.First time users will find the site friendly and useful; however, people doing research may find that it needs to be cataloged differently to prevent one from diverting and jumping among the different subject matters.",3

The website is full of graphic illustrations with textual explanation,to help learner to understand topics easily.  The depth and accuracy of the material is impressive. A practical teaching tool for web learning.Technical Remarks: The website is very user-friendly, its effective using of graphics successfully enhances learning experience.  The website is text-directed, without navigation bars, instead, it contains links full of graphic descriptions.  It would be nicer if it could also includes video files and more audio files to make it a real multimedia web learning source. ",3

981,"This is a good lesson plan for teaching high school students how to construct and deliver an informative speech. The outline for the plan is easy to read and contains real objectives and activities such as outlining, creating examples, and using statistics that can advance their knowledge of delivering a speech. The lesson plan references using a PowerPoint to teach the material to the students, although that PowerPoint is not given. Suggestions for evaluation both by the instructor and the student peers are given, including the ""sandwich"" method of giving feedback. 
This would be a very good learning tool to construct a lesson plan to teach informative speaking. The document is easy to read and very usable. The quality is also good with activities and outcomes matching up with the intended skills for the students to acquire. ",4
981,"A quality and detailed lesson plan that directly links to both real-world skills and state standards. This lesson is obviously well thought out from start to finish and encompasses many transitions. The prior knowledge activity with the PowerPoint presentation and an opportunity to practice the skill in an unthreatening format is wonderful. In addition, technology is integrated in the research stage for the speeches. Also, the feedback stipulation of ""sandwich - positive, critical, positive"" is a great way to ensure that students get valuable feedback from their peers without being too intimidated. In addition, the detailed requirements for the students of what needs to be in their speeches are great.This lesson could be improved by adding a more specific evaluation tool like a rubric. Because students are delivering speeches, grading may be subjective. An evaluation tool included in the lesson would take it to the next level. In addition, the section where the instructor shows a video of himself or herself as a college freshman is a great idea but may not be feasible for all teachers.",4
981,"This is a great lesson!  It is very appropriate for the age group and will help students become more comfortable with public speaking.  I like how students have to make an outline to organize what they will say.  This is a tool that will help them in the future with not only planned speeches, but day to day communicating with others.  The objectives are very clear.  The evaluation is also very clear and sets expectations up front for the students to meet.  The actual lesson itself is not as clear.  it would be better if you included step by step on how you would teach the lesson and when they would have time to research and plan their speech.  I think it is great that you will have students give feedback to other students.  The meaningfulness is also one of the positives of this lesson.  Letting students choose a topic they care about will help to engage the students.  I really like that you will show a speech you did yourself and I can see how students will really be engaged in this.  Overall, this is a fantastic lesson that I would use in my classroom with some adjustments to fit the age group and skill level.",4
982,I think the game aspect of your lesson made a lot of sense.  We somtimes forget how competitive students can get with things like this.  I think you did a good job including your ESOL students.  They should benefit greatly from your planning.  You also did a great job of integrating technology into your lesson plan.  I have seen the math applet before and it seemed great.Technical Remarks:Everything worked well for me.,5
982,"This lesson plan has a great technology component - the mathematic applet.  I think students will be very interested to use computers and the applet to help solve problems.  I also like the unintended consequences that some students will be motivated by the ""game"" atmosphere and forget that they are actually doing an assignment.  Great inclusion of the UDL principles to help accomodate all learners including your ESOL students. Technical Remarks:None",5
982,Your universally designed lesson plan for exponents gives students the option to solve a problem by writing down the steps or to manipulate tiles to show the reasoning. Graphic organizers can help many different types of learners as can the interactivity and self-pace/monitoring of the applet you use during the second lesson.

984,"First let me say that I think trying to address chemical reactions in this StAIR is a very admirable task due to the complicated nature of them and the difficulty addressing some of the questions students sometimes have.  With that said, I think you did a very good job in doing just that.  There is so much that goes into reactions and I believe you did a great job of trying to cover all of that information throughout the presentation.  I liked that you reviewed formula writing and balancing along with the information presented about reactions.  In addition, I think choosing only three types of chemical reactions for the StAIR was a good choice and one that made it something you could realistically do.  I know that once you get into single and double displacement reactions the amount of things that must be dealt with increases dramatically and in truth I don’t believe those could be covered in something like this without spending an unbelievable amount of time designing it.  So in short, I think this is just right.However, there are a few things I would have changed to make the presentation flow a bit better.  First, I thought there were too many animations throughout the presentation.  I realize that this might be my own personal opinion but sometimes I just want to see the text and move on.  I feel sometimes that people, myself included, feel the need to animate everything that shows up on a powerpoint slide when in truth sometimes that animation just slows the thing down.  Another suggestion I have is the same thing I said for Tammie’s, which is to perhaps include some sort of audio track explaining the written text.  I realize this adds an entirely new layer of work to the activity but I believe it might have helped for certain points with students who learn better audibly.Overall though, I think it is a really great presentation!Technical Remarks:I only have two small technical aspects that I might take issue with.  The first is that this PowerPoint ran really slowly on my computer throughout.  I think that was due to the animations and PowerPoint being what it is.  I know it was not my computer as it is quite powerful.  I say this because I know most school computers do not have anywhere near the processing power of this thing and they might run the presentation even slower.  They might have no problem though, it is just a thought.  In addition, perhaps having the presentation begin automatically as soon as you open it would be a good idea.  It would prevent the user from accidently clicking or doing something that messes it up before they begin the slideshow.",4
984,"First,  I think the topic is one students often struggle with.  Reactions, whether it's identifying the type of reaction or predicting products is one of the most difficult topics for students.I like the various examples for students practice, and I think the quiz is an excellent way for students to check their understanding.  Have you thought about expanding this to include all the reaction types that you teach?  This would be a great way to introduce the topic and then another way for students to review with later.All your fonts and colors are easy to read and very clear.  I didn't hear any sound.  Was this intentional?  I think some sounds, not too many, would help keep students engaged and interested in the tutorial.I think having the objectives present is great.  This really helps students recognize what they will be learning and expected to know and do once they are finished.Your visuals are colorful and are excellent ways for students to connect concepts to meaning.  I like how you used the dots to represent reactants and products.  Using colors that when combined create a new color is genius.  Students know when you mix blue and yellow, green is produced.  So that is an alternate way of helping them connect their prior knowledge to new concepts when building understanding.Technical Remarks:One remark, not sure if it would be technical or just a regular comment, but I think there maybe too many transiitions on the slides or the transitions may need to be sped up a bit.  I felt I was waiting a while for the information to come on the screen.  This many transitions may be a bit distracting.  But again that might be a personal preference.",4

`
I especially liked Amadou and Mariam's full album ""Dimanche a Bamako"" -- a concert they gave in the Malian capital.  There were other songs and interviews with the two of them, as well as other interviews and other Malian singers.  What we do not have is a pedagogical guide or overview.  When using this with my college students, I would either assign them to look for background information OR, for lower-level students, I would need to prepare pedagogical sheets of my own.  The songs Amadou and Mariam sing are primarily in French, but some are in Bambara.

1021,"This is a great web site I spent an hour and a half on this game. The wording is kind of confusing but this is how it works.    You click on the set button at the bottom of the calender. Then you drag the cursor inside the calender over a section of dates. It doesn't matter how small of large you make the square. Then you add the numbers diagnaly and you will get a sum. The sum will always be the same no matter what numbers the person picks. The magic part is that the numbers the person picks has to be in a diagnal form. For example, on the September 2002 calender the dates I selected were   3,4,5  I added the 3,11,and 19 and the sum     10,11,12 is 33. It's the same if you add the     17,18,19  17,11 and 5 = 33. This is when you get a friend to come over to the computer and ask them to select three numbers in each row. You already selected the square so you know what the sum is. That is the magic part the persons expression is priceless.   This is a fun game to play and there are many possibilities to choose from.

I spend a good 30mins looking over this site playing around with the different patterns. It is very well put together and a great 'hands-on' resource to build on an existing knowledge of geometric shapes. It could even be a good introduction to geometric theory as well. As I am a visual and tactile learner, I really enjoyed it and think it would be helpful to people who have a similar learning style.Technical Remarks:I would be a bit concerned for anyone who was trying to access the links if they did not have Java on their computers.

1025,"a) I basically just read the material and tried to do outside research on it because it was fascinating to read about.

b) The material was pretty accurate with the patterns and colors that can be selected. It shows  selection of line segments that can be drawn and the program replicates the chosen pattern. It be good to check out the website which relates to this subject: http://www.ScienceU.com/geometry/articles/tiling/wallpaper.html 

c) I believe that it is a effective enhancement tool for teaching because of the fact that it is fun and it gets students involve under the category of geometry.

d) Basically when first time users go on it and follow the directions then they could easily produce a wide variety of colorful and attractive patterns.",4
1025,I enjoyed this program. I spent thirty-minutes reviewing and experimenting with the various patterns and found it to be interesting and creative.  A lot of the information given was valuable.  I don't forsee anyone having any issues accessing this website.  ,5

When we begin our discussion of developing and writing lesson plans, I use this site as a reference for good ideas and solid examples.  It also contains links to professional organizations, and a number of other sections which my teachers in training have found beneficial.Technical Remarks: Several of the linked websites require the latest version of QuickTime in order to run.",5

1030,"I am a graduate student working on an assignment for a class.  I have spent several hours reviewing the MERLOT website.  This particular website I found most interesting.  I teach music in a multi-level classroom.  I am planning to use this website to enhance the understanding of general music studies.  The performances range in length from around 5 minutes to over an hour.  The performances can be used to enhance a music lesson as well as other content areas.  The range of performances is unbelievable, from a celebration of the USO to Flamenco dancers.  This site allows for the sharing of performing arts within a classroom without traveling to a performance.  The usefulness of these performances is unending.  This website is very easy to use.  It has a searchable database that allows one to search by artist, keyword, date or genre.  The archives date back to October 1998.  There is also a calendar for upcoming performances.  This feature allows for ease of use within the standards for teaching music.Technical Remarks: The best viewing for the performances is in the original size in which it opens.  The sound quality is very good.  The performances are best viewed with RealPlayer 8.",5
1031,Excellent resource. It is concise and the hyperlinks within the text all work. Nice job!,5

1033,This curriculum is a great way to teach children the importance of being kind to each other.,4
1034,"This applet is similar to the applet Impulsive Forces, by the same author.  However, the graphics pertaining to the plots are much better, making this applet more useful.  I like the overall approach, but I still think that omitting the masses of the objects is problematic.",4
1035,Very nice applet that demonstrates the Bolztmann distribution well.   Also provides references.,4
1036,"a) It took me about 30 minutes to fully review this site. I went in and out of each links, spending more or less time on a topic that interested me or less, or I spent more time on topics that I didn't know what they were. For example, the section titled ""The Planimeter"" was about a mathematical tool that I hadn't previously heard of, so I spent more time there than I had for ""Chinese Handcuffs"".

b)I think that the site does a good job at explaining concepts. In fact that is likely it's strongest point, which is that it accurately (at least to the best of my knowledge) conveys information in such a logical manner. Concerning how educationally significant they are, I think the writer of the site sort of takes away from that by explaining in the very first paragraph that he doesn't feel the need to relate these mathematical concepts to students every day lives. True, that not everything can be related. But it takes away from any possible building interest to read that as a student. So yes, the materials are educationally significant, in the way that all things can be significant, but the author is unable to show students why/how this is important to them. 

c)Certainly if a student were doing a report on any of these topics, or if a teacher would like to give students additional resources to review on their own, this would be a good site for that. It's very well written and concepts are explained very clearly, in my opinion. I especially think that the way concepts and topics are clearly organized, which always makes for better teaching/learning. Too often do educational website become too muddled and confusing with poor page design, which ultimately intimidates students. 

d) The material is easy to use, and the files or Geometer's Sketchpad aren't extremely large files, so the typical student's laptop should be able to download it with ease. Like said before, concepts are explained well and topics are organized, so it's impossible to get lost or confused amongst the materials.",3
1036,"I spent about two hours looking over the links on this site, going though them and trying out the interactive ones. Here are the ones I found to be interesting to me: The Sliding triangle, Linkages, The Planimeter, The Reuleaux and Inversion Geometry.I found this site to be fun and interesting at the same time, an interactive site that is educating and fun. I checked out about a dozen of the lessons and had fun trying out the interactive ones. I think this it a good site for young and old students and a good teaching site. The site explains the problems and shows you how to visualize the concept of it to, this is a good way to show what the out come is of the problem and how easy it is to grasp the concept of it. This is a very easy to use and is a very well designed site with descriptive, interesting visual effects, interactive perspective drawings and more. I find that using this types of visual effects not only help you  to learn, it helps to make it more fun for the person learning or teaching. ",3
1036,"I took a look at this website more than one time before deciding to add a comment. I spend approximately 2 1/2 hours total time on site- my first visit for about an hour and my second visit 1 1/2 hours.What initally attracted me was how Kunkel interacted with his dialog in a witty and informative style.He refers to this website as presenting ""mathematic investigation"" I thought it was exploritory in nature and invites curiousity. Some sections were very detailed and held my interst more so then others, I spent some time on: Chinese handcuffes; The Sliding triangle; The Brachstochrome; and Rungs and Vineyards. Rungs & Vineyards was my favorite it's about the visial illusion exxperienced while traveling in a car and passing a vineyards.Kunkel uses Sketchpad to enhance his examples- I don't have this program on the computer I using but was still able to appreciate the examples give.

Also, to accomodate more interests you may want to have students choose 3 different games under the addition tab or select 2 others to go along with the Diaper Derby.  This will provide students with addition practice in different contexts and some games may interest some students more than others. Overall, this is a helpful resource to use that easily assesses student progress!  Great job!Technical Remarks:On the PowerPoint, have the links on slide 2 instead of slide 3 and on slide 4 instead of slide 10 to make it more user friendly.",4
1073,I am enjoying going through this. You have very clear instructions and your voice addition is very helpful for UDL. Using fun4brain was a great idea for interactivity.

1076,"I have not dabbled much into the creating and planing of buildings, however; I did take a engineering class for fun in high school. We had to draw out a floor plan and calculate the square footage and the many dimensions. So reading this material brings me back to that, but the math in all the arts was what grabbed hold of my attention. Being a practitioner of the arts I love to see how mathematics can be used in all media. This brings me to one of my favorite moments in my schooling so far. For my final in senior year Studio Art I had to scale a picture on a piece of paper the size of a postage stamp to fit a 12 by 14 foot wall. Never really having a strong calculating background it was hard to put it simply.",4
1076,"After spending about twenty minutes reviewing the content of the article I came out with a favorable opinion of the content. Despite being a rubric for a college course I thought that there was a good quality to the material. 

I like the idea of being able to look around and view the world from a mathematical perspective. To be able to visualize common objects or buildings and know something interesting about them. Additionally the content is educationally viable and useful to disciplines such as architecture. 

I believe that somebody could use this page as an effective teaching or learning tool. Or even as a way to convince somebody who dosn't particularly like math that it is relevant to them in many different ways. 

Lastly, the site is fairly well organized with a table of contents with clickable links to the information listed below. The only troubling thing about the page has to be that it was designed as a class information sheet, other than that this article was good.",4
1077,"This is a fantastic lesson with real-world application. The steps provided in the lesson write-up are very easy to follow. The objectives are clearly stated and will be easy for students to understand. The lesson has a nice hook, using a funny video to get students interested and it also draws them in by helping them to clearly see the need for the real-world application of what they are learning. There is a lot of modeling done by the teacher to ensure that students can clearly understad the steps to correctly completing the tasks, and students are provided with assignment sheets that clearly outline the steps and expectations. It accomodates multiple learning styles and uses a variety of instruction techniques. Scaffolding is clearly provided for the students as the students are given lots of practice and the teacher has opportunity to check student work and provide feedback. The formative assessment ensures that all students in the class are understanding the information as it is taught and practiced.Technical Remarks:I like that students use something that they are familiar with every day (school lunches) and then are allowed to explore other menus on the internet. I like that they are given freedom to explore different restaurants, but I would also provide a list of menus/sites that the teacher is familiar with and that the teacher knows would be easier for the students to work with.",5
1077,"This lesson plan addresses a very common need that every informed individual should understand. This lesson hits home because I was a waitress for many years, and was not always tipped correctly even when I gave good/excellent table service. I worked at a low priced restaurant in Flint, Michigan, and a high attraction restaurant with expensive menu items in Frankenmuth, MI. It didn’t matter where I was a server; I found that not all people have this knowledge.   This lesson is well thought out and conveyed in a detailed manner. Each expectation is clearly written and easily reproducible. The lesson has clear objectives, several means of assessment of the students’ understanding. The familiarity of school lunches is a great final assessment that relates the need of this knowledge to the students.  This lesson is also clear and easy to understand for the students since they should already know how to use the technology, and have experienced the giving of tips and taxes in their personal lives.  Next, the lesson incorporates technology students are familiar with to accomplish the goals of this lesson.  Most students, by sixth grade, understand the basics of using a computer and the internet. This aligns with the majority of the NETs for students (numbers 2-6).  Adding in the skit as a preparatory element, intended to get the students’ attention, further incorporates technology that enhances the intended learning outcome. It also provides comic relief to a subject (math) that not all students are good at.  Pedagogical speaking, this lesson incorporates aspects of all three major learning styles: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.  Visual learners benefit from seeing what they are learning. This lesson fulfils that need by a teacher lead example. Auditory learners’ needs are met because there is group discussions about what is expected of them, as well as, group activates that require communication between group members. Kinesthetic learners learn best through illustrating their knowledge through movement. Having the students applying their knowledge with the lunch menu is a very natural way to have kinesthetic express their understanding. Other pedagogy noted are: whole class discussions on teacher lead example, peer directed learning through activity practices, and effective classroom management as teacher is circling the room while students work.Technical Remarks:As a user of online ordering, I would make sure that the teacher looks through as many online menus as possible before starting this lesson. Some sites may be confusing to students, and some might not have costs for the items.  I would also add in the discussion about online etiquette with regards to actually placing orders from the websites.",5

I think the idea of modeling to your students is a very good one. I am unclear on whether or not you tested out the actual math of it though? This may but more of a mute point, as your students should have already obtained all the skills prior. One way I might suggest looking at this would be to take out the take a tip to start with though. (e.g. if you have 70 dollars, that means your bill can be 55.03 prior to 6% sales tax and 20% tip.) I think that strategy might help kids who are a little slower with math, as it takes the “twist” out, or so to speak. I want to reiterate, that I think this is a great lesson; I also know this lesson to be a challenging one.",5
1083,I found that my students greatly benefitted from this lesson! They were incredibly engaged and asked that we do it again later in the year.  I was able to get menus easily by going to restaurants and exaplaining what I was using them for. Another plus of the lesson is that it is easily modified to fit other grade levels.,4
1084,"This is great material and can provide great insight during class.  My only concern is that is becoming a little outdated.  As long as students can get past this aspect, it can be a great tool.",4
1085,"Excellent tutorial Web based interactive site to teach the students the step in Mesh Analysis.Technical Remarks: it engages students learning the steps of mesh Analysis, KVL Eq., Supermesh and Ohm's Law.",5
1086,"This web site is an excellent resource for Spanish teachers as it contains a plethora of reliable information about Mexico.  Included in this site are maps, authentic recipes, Mexico?s history, its government, customs, traditions, holidays and current events. This site has many beautiful pictures of the country and its people. Definitely a place to visit if one needs to research anything concerning Mexico. I have included this site in several cultural lesson plans in order that students can access this web page as a way to connect to the information needed to complete activities  related to the different plans. Although the data is in English, the information given is useful not only to the students, but to the teacher as well.Technical Remarks:This site performs at optimal capacity with inlinks allowing for easy navigation and connecting in minimal time. There are also outlinks to connect one to other relevant sites.",5
1086,"This site designed to inform the general public on all aspects of Mexico, the country, its people, its culture and places to visit or live.  It provides very useful information for the individual conducting business within Mexico. The site includes a monthly electronic publication, photo images, and even sound bites. Be sure to connect to the yearly calendar which includes hot links related to the important national holidays and festivals. The sections under Culture include invaluable information on Mexico's history, traditions, foods, recipes, and even a forum to request traditional recipes. In English and Spanish.I have incorporated this site using the page that links to "" Art and Artesans.""  While the information is in English, the content information is so very helpful to the teacher.  There are wonderful images and further links to related readings.  I was also able to find other information on the history and architecture of haciendas in Mexico.  I often create cultural links like these to  my own webpage!",4
1087,great text book!! have refered to it a few times in my class.,5
1088,Would consider this free book as a resource for workshop and training sessions.,4
1089,"Excellent, an article that focuses upon pedagogy and not primarily on the technology!!!!  This article captures the dream I had for technology and teaching in the 1990's.  Since then we've waded through stages of adoption of technology that have taken us back to our rudimentary ways of teaching which place the learner in a passive position.  Now, with this work and others like it, we are seeing the true learner-centered pedagogical power of teaching using a CMS!  I applaud this work!Technical Remarks:The author bases her work upon solid pedagogical work.  The writing about deeper learning is well done.  By dividing the work into five categories, the author makes this work relevant to faculty developing learning content in the online environment really accessible.

This author does not include much reference to the online learning research of the last few years which is taking our practice to new levels in this technology rich environment. 

I recommend this article to faculty beginning their work in the online environment.  It sets a new vision of what's possible.",4
1090,"Applet demonstrates physics phenomena -- that of multiple mirrors -- that isn't covered much in introductory physics.  Fun to use, but the choice of colors for the rays makes it hard to see what is going on.",4

1092,Excellent visual resource for a basic cellular function.Technical Remarks:The links from image to image work flawlessly.,5
1093,"I recently selected this animation as part of a lesson on cell division.  My students will view the animation in order to gather information on each phase of mitosis.  The large graphics and clear labeling will help my students make sense of the mitosis process.  The animation's combination of graphics, text, and audio made the content easy to understand.  The content accurately depicts mitosis in language my students will easily comprehend.  The animation  enhances the lesson by illustrating the individual steps involved in the complex process of cell division. Although the animation is clear and easy to understand, the graphics of prophase could be more detailed.Technical Remarks: This animation was very user friendly.  I accessed the material several times while planning the lesson and did not experience any difficulties.  The graphics were clear and the audio portion was easy to understand.  The pause button will help my students take notes while watching the illustration. The link from the merlot site goes to a web page with a link to the animation.  This two step procedure provides easy access to the animation but may need explanation during the lesson. ",4
1094,I worked with this software for many hours already and used it for building models for different kind of Physics problems... And it is great! What is more... it is free to use for everybody. It is much better dan a lot of other modelling software you have to pay a lot of Money for. We should nominate the maker (Vitor Duarte Teodoro) for a price.It is specially a good education tool. The linking of a mathematical model to a simulation makes that studentsactually can view the connection between a certain physical concept and the mathematics behind that. Specially when paramaters can be changed easily and interactive (also during simulation). Also the setup of different cases is very easy.If your teaching or learning science you should use this tool.As with every tool you need to spend a bit of time in understanding the tool. But Modellus is very easy to use. If you download the manual as well (also on the site) you have a lot of examples and a tutorial for beginning users as well for more advanced users.Technical Remarks: I used it on several computers with Win95 and Win98 without any problems (although it is a Win3.x application).The only drawback is that file names (for your models) can't have more then 8 characters. But I understand that a version that support long file names is testes right now (March 2001) and will be available soon.,5
1095,This suite of information seeking models helps students understand different ways that people search for information. Models are current and research-based. This resource is one chapter in the the book on search user interface.,4
1096,Great website to learn about basic biology,5
1097,"A very detailed description of Mohr's circles, with an applet that appears to work well. For those that have had experience with Mohr's circles this applet would probably very useful. Otherwise, a user is going to have to spend a lot of time poring through the technical material and sort out what is going on. Definitely meant for those currently studying Mohr's circles in an upper-division course.Technical Remarks:Suffers from design problems. First, there is no need to carry out data to a dozen digits on the screen, which makes the graphics messy. Greek letters would clean up the appearance as well.",3
1098,"Like the rest of the sites in the author's collection, this site is very informative, clear, and uses nice graphics (some animated) to illustrate the points.  Very extensive discussion.  For a nontechnical discussion, this site should be very helpful.",5
1099,"This really is a good site, along with a bunch of Virtual Labs from McGraw-Hill and their Science Student Center (that link for Virtual Labs is also at this MERLOT Site and opens a buch of other labs).  Yay!",5
1100,I thought your website was very well written and easy to understand.  I found the information to be very well written.Technical Remarks:Print not quite as easy on the eyes as I would like for it to be. ,4
1100,"The fascinating topic of the golden ratio is introduced, and the explained further in several activities.  The activities discuss the appearance of the Golden Ratio in the Parthenon, the Mona Lisa, and in nature.  The cite also shows how to construct a golden rectangle and golden spiral through easy to follow steps.  
At the end of the cite there is a quiz to see what we have learned.  This cite does a good job of explaining a very interesting subject.",4
1101,"A clever idea, but with cumbersome mouse controls.  Takes quite awhile to figure out how to work, even though the author explains each step clearly. ",3
1102,"What a wonderful lesson.  I really like how multiplying and dividing fractions is connected with a real world concept.  It is important for students to see what they are learning being applied in the real world.  Also, it was nice that the powerpoint used to explain the concept was embedded in the online lesson plan.  That makes this lesson very accessible to other teachers.  The powerpoint gives a nice visual understanding of the concept that relates to their lives and activates their prior knowledge.  Great Lesson!",5
1102,"I think this is a great lesson plan because it uses math in a real world context. Too often students don't see the connection between what they are learning in class and how it can help them in the real world. By analyzing serving sizes while using fractions, students will be able to see the practicality of this task. It also sounds like it builds on students' prior knowledge of multiplying and dividing whole numbers, as well as their knowledge of fractions. This sounds like a fun activity to put that knowledge to use. Great job!",5
1103,"Great setup with obvious attention paid to instructional practices, standards, and purpose.  Pictoral representation of fractions is a great way to explain their multiplication, and the colors used were appropriate and pleasant to look at.  I liked that it moved back and forth between pictoral representations and mathematical processes.  Scaffolding is also obvious and appreciated.  The author has obviously spent a great deal of time thinking about instructional strategies.The activity could have used some more interactivity, although I did like that it linked to outside sources for review material.  I would have liked to see some real-world applications, some interactive activities besides quizzes, and some pictures or videos used (got a little repetitive in the examples section).Most of my disappointment with this activity is with the technical aspects of it.  I didn't get any of the sound when I played it (except the applause in the quiz).  The transitions within slides seemed very fast (not enough time to read the text before the next shot in).  On the quiz, some of the comments to incorrect answers were incorrect themselves.  When you go back into the examples to review, you are stuck going through the whole presentation again.  Finally, I couldn't figure out the slide creation activity at the end.  I got to the slide, but had no idea what to do.  Some instruction would be helpful in this instance.Technical Remarks:Needs some technical work before it is usable.",3
1103,"The Multiplying Fractions StAIR did a wonderful job approaching a difficult concept with ease.  The topic of multiplying fractions is meaningful to the stated audience of 6th grade, and can be used to teach, review, or enrich skills according to the defined objectives and grade level standards.  Prior knowledge is accessed through the use of identifying basic fractions, and scaffolding is present towards multiplication.  The vocabulary covered is essential to the topic while the use of colors and pictures establishes connections to support different learners.  The StAIR used multiple pedagogical strategies to break down learning barriers and enhance student success.  The PowerPoint slide show has these strategies listed in the notes below.  The quiz at the end of the presentation allows students to apply learned skills and reflect on new understandings.The Multiplying Fractions StAIR is well thought out, and I would not recommend any changes to the content with the exception of real world applications.  However, I would reformat the presentation so that the action buttons are usable.  The StAIR also has audio features that are inaccessible.  Finally, the reformatting would support the quiz and allow appropriate feedback. The current format leads the learner towards the wrong feedback after answering questions.Technical Remarks:Presentation reformatting is necessary to use this slide show the way it is intended in the classroom.",4

1105,"A very enthusiastic YES for the Music Animation Machine by Malinowski. Students are amazed at the visualization of music they have only heard, in this way. There are many selections from which to choose, from simple to complex. In addition, Malinowski continues to experiment with different ways to display measures, length of notes, musical lines, impingement of sounds through colors, shapes and duration and relationships between and among these things. I use this tool in music theory, introduction to music, with chamber music students and professional colleagues - all of whom are captivated.",5

Reactions range from simple, elementary mechanisms, to more difficult reactions. Each mechanistic entry can be checked for correctness and, if incorrect, the system will provide helpful hints to assist the user in deducing the correct mechaniam. Technical Remarks:The drawing system appears to be a touch finicky. The user must click in exactly the right places on the bonds and atoms to get a system response.",4
1106,Good introductory Material for organic Chemistry Beginners.,4
1107,Not sure of the application in the classroom. Is this just for reference? Pardon my ignorance.,3
1108,I experimented with the material for several days and many hours.  The quality of the content was very accurate and with man usefull links. The material is very significant for those being educated in the science area.  If used properly one can gain a alot of usefull information. I used the material to seach for caves throughout the United States.Technical Remarks: This website was very well created.  I had no problems navigating through this site.  The pages were centrally located and there werenavigational links on every page.  Any first time user of the internet will have an easy time using this site.  The font size was consistant throughout the site.  The background color and font color contrasted to it made reading easy.  ,5

1109,"I spent I a few minutes browsing the stie, and it has quite a bit of good information on English and literacy.  It offers lots of resources, like research on literacy and development of reading skills.  It also offers teachers help with reading instruction.  It also has a good list of publications, like the newsletter and a list of helpful books and articles.  It also contains a list of services offered by the CELA.  This website is very easy to navigate and could be a very useful resource.  ",4
1109,This information is easily understood in reading.   I spent some time reviewing the content and find it is useful information in enhancing teaching as well as learning.  First time users will find it fairly easy to use the software.,4

1116,"These resources are well designed and tested, and they work!  As a result, students become engaged in the dialogue and values judgements demands of modern science.  However, two problems remain: (1) So far, the units appear to have been tested in upper middle class schools.  Can NIH design units that will be particularly interesting to under-represented minorities?  (2) If curriculum materials at the high school level are introducing issues in modern research to high school students, what are we doing at the college level to ascertain that the teachers will be qualified to implement these units?  These materials are developed for high school students, but similar college-level materials that address recent trends in biomedical research should also be developed for current college students.Technical Remarks:The resources are provided on CDRom, but black-and-white handouts can be printed and used in the absence of computer resources.",5
1117,This is a wonderful resource to understand the basics of the nitrogen cycle.  Better and bigger graphics and animations would be helpful.,3

1118,"I put this link on every syllabus for every class I teach.  One of the issues I have with grading papers that are supposed to be APA format is that the students are blissfully unaware of the correct format.  They need only read the prompts and type in their material and a correct citation is generated.  This is a wonderful tool.  
Additionally for a minimal fee, you are able to create whole bibliographies which can be exported...much cheaper than a bibliographic program.",4
1119,"This resource is very well designed and presents multiple, appealing formats. The timeline option on the right side titled ""FACE OFF"" leads to an informative and cleanly displayed timeline highlighting political tensions between North Korea and the US. 
 
The various topics such as general background, government, military, and economy present basic information about the country in a way that is easy for the user to access. These blocks of information are presented in an apprealing way. Some small pictures are utilized to break the monotony of text and give the website an appealing flow. 
 
If the site were up to date in the year 2014, it would be an even more valubale resource. Stilll, the information provided is thorough and well organized. A student may still utilize this website when researching general facts about North Korea or North Korean relations with the US up until 2003.",4

First, how is language learned. Second, is it nature or nurture that allows someone to learn and develop? It can also be used to discuss ethics in research. It can also be used to discuss the importance of human warmth and touch in development. This would be a great take home assignment for students. Have them read it and then allow the to discus their thoughts. It would be good to have some leading questions ready to help lead students in an educational direction.Technical Remarks:Easy to use.

1130,"Lot's of information here. Maybe even a little too much. There was information that would be great for as low as second grade but then the formulas were too advanced for them. If you were in a grade that was advanced enough to be looking at formulas, then you probably already know the other information presented. I got a little lost with where the buttons were going to take me so ended up covering same information several times. A few suggestions in the technical remarks to help make this more useful. Nice job!Technical Remarks:Links seemed to be working however, I might add the following suggestions:~Slower delivery of the written material. Reading became distracted as a new line of text sails onto the screen.~Add directions on ""Ready to Learn About"" page letting students know to click on something~Question 7: the sentence runs off the page  so you don't know the question being asked.~I got laughed at on a wrong answer!",4

The document is very easy to navigate through. There are a variety of transitions which should increase the engagement level of the students.",5
1131,This lesson applies investigation to an easy to grasp concept. What a great application using the scientific method and incorporation of math to a real world situation and brining the investigation into the lab.  Incorporating web 2.0 tools to relate results is a nice way for students to collaborate and share information. I wonder if students could use a tutorial on how to add data tables to a blog and review positioning and captions.,4
1131,"Great hands-on science lesson.  Conducting experiments is a great way to hold student interest.  The idea of posting the results to a blog is a great way for the students to practice technical or scientific writing.  It should also be a motivation to do their best since their audience will theoretically be the whole world.I did wonder if the lab, perhaps, also focused on how salt solutions keep the roads from icing over.  It wasn't directly mentioned in the lesson plan, but it was alluded to in the section about motivation under the sub-heading ""meaningfullness."" Technical Remarks:No technical issues.",4
1131,"Great lab and wonderul use of the UDL principles.  You were able to create a hand-on lab experience while integrating technology!  I like the idea of giving the children a real world problem and allowing them to investigate it using another material (i.e. seeing the effects on plants by studying the onion).  I might suggest that you pair the stronger students with the struggling students as opposed to allowing them to choose their own groups, this is a lab that could benefit from teacher guided pairing.Technical Remarks:No technical difficulties encountered.",4

1136,"I think this site is definitely appropriate for college level students taking music theory classes.  I believe that some of it could be used by upper level high school students serious about a career in music.  It is easy to maneuver through the site. I think this is a very educational oriented website and would work well alongside a music theory class.  It allows you to look at musical works and analyze them.  It also has a question and answer part as well. It has interactive exercises that allow you to work with intervals and chords. The music theory reference is wonderful allowing you to learn about scales, chords, intervals, and harmony. Technical Remarks: I really like that the site can be viewed in English or Spanish.  You do need Quicktime to listen to the music examples.  On my computer it opens up another window to play the Quicktime music and you are not able to see the actual music then.  There are no other problems with the site.",4

1140,"I've used this as a supplemental text in a graduate course on the topic of distance education. While my primary text addressed history and theories associated with distance education, selected chapters from ""Opening Up Education"" provided a counterpoint to traditional distance education by introducing various concepts from the open educational resources movement.Technical Remarks:Chapters are available as individual pdfs or in one large pdf. These files may be linked to, or they may be downloaded and ""remixed"" under a Creative Commons license. While I provide a link to Adobe Acrobat reader, I've never had any students report difficulty in accessing these materials.",4
1141,"This was a well thought out lesson!  Topics were on target with both pre-algebra and algebra standards.  The structure of this lesson flowed very well, which would most certainly keep a young student's attention.  By keeping the slides very similar throughout, a consistency was provided to the students.  On examples, mathematical work was shown toward the left-hand side of the screen and mathematical reasons were shown on the right-hand side of the screen.  This consistent structure added to the flow of the lesson.Technical Remarks:I think it would be important to ensure that the fact that you must compute the multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction steps from left to right was highlighted.  This is a major misconception due to the fact that PEMDAS is often written horizontally rather than vertically.The video of the PEMDAS rap was cute, but unfortunately very poor in audio quality.  I could barely make out the words the singers were saying.",4
1141,"The sound effects are great. It gave me a real sense of accomplishment! Have you thought about adding a voice for the text portion? If you have a student that struggles with reading, but is pretty good with math, he/she may still have a lot of trouble getting through this. I like how you show everything step by step. All of the videos work well, which is great. I could not manage to make the videos functional on my own StAIR. Maybe I will have to publish them in YouTube and link them. The videos are a nice touch. I think the students will find them engaging and memmorable. In the first example, the students are asked who does the problem correctly. I know that I really wanted a chance to figure it out, but the answer was just given. Could the student have a chance to answer? It also might be worthwhile to point out why the other options were not correct. Giving the students options for extra examples is a great idea. I was ready to move on, but students may not be. On the first challenge, there are suddenly brackets. Have you already discussed brackets at this point? If not, have you thought about holding off for one or two problems until they get the hang of it and then throwing them a curve ball? If not that is fine. You explain it well. It might just freak some students out a bit. On the slide that says ""Evaluate 21-x+2(times) 5 for x+7, the texts adds really fast. I kind of felt like I didn't have time to think. Have you considered slowing it down at all or having the text prompted by clicking? That way students could move at their own pace. This whole thing is really great! I enjoyed doing math again! The website was really great, too! I missed the $100,00 question, though. Good thing I am not a math teacher!Great job!",5
1141,This is an excellent resource for teachers and students. Try it out.,5
1142,"Really cool, and by the way I really like the stick figure icons that you used. Where did you find them? Overall, this was informative, easy to understand and beneficial. The best part of this assignment in the graduated structure of the work, you enable the student to interact with the material and then continue on at the learner's own pace. this is great because it achieves self-directed growth through interactive learning opportunities. Well done!  Though I did have problems with the Stair when I got to  the 20/5+5x3= slide. Each answer that I selected was considered wrong and I could get no further. However, this was an interesting way to look at a math theory that I wish I had had when I was in school. It was also very nice the uniformity of the slide, it really made it seems as if it was a fluid presentation and clear about its outcomes.  Well done!",4
1142,I like this STAIR. It is a very straight forward resource for students to work through. The content is appropriate to the objectives and it works through a systematic approach to reach the goals. The quizzes offer opportunities for feedback. The animations are engaging and age appropriate. A good STAIR,4
1143,"Excellent StAIR!!  I really like the layout of the tutorial.  It's easy to navigate through the lesson and the options of things to do offer a good deal of variety for the student.  The steps for solving are provided so the student can refer to that if he or she gets stuck.  I like the vocabulary terms option as well.  A great list of websites is included too!  Nice work! I can't think of anything I'd change.  Technical Remarks:Easy navigation, links work, good layout that isn't overwhelming",5
1143,"This material would work with a variety of students as it uses analogies, acronymns, and varous instructional startegies to assist students in remember the order of operations.  The lesson is easy to follow and explanations are clear.  This would work well with students who need additional review of the order of operations. You could use this with students as a follow or practice assignment as well.Technical Remarks:The powerpoint is easy to use and follow.",5
1144,"Excellent tutorials! I have been using these tutorials in my organic chemistry labs for a few years now as part of the prelab preparation process. They provide students with a detailed explanation of the theory as a well as one or more videos showing experimental setup and the technique actually being performed. Safety issues and troubleshooting advice are also addressed.
I have had students comment on how useful these tutorials are, and the only criticism I have heard is that more techniques should be covered.",5
1145,"This is so neat! Students can use this Colby College resource to identify unknown organic compounds by imputting physical data like melting points, UV absorption wavelengths, mass spec peaks or any knowledge they have about functional groups or molecular formulas. It's a rather reliable system as it has built in error bars for the measurments. This would make identifying organics a far simpler process. This could potentially be used in an undergraduate organic chemistry lab in which students must identify an unknown.",4
1146,Excellent explanation of the OSI model and tutorial.Technical Remarks: The links to other related information are helpful and easy to use. ,5
1146,I found it easier to understand the differnt layers of the OSI model. Some of the students pages were hard to read due to the use of colors. I was unable to open the student tutorials.Technical Remarks: The different pages could have more uniformity.,3
1146,Good site to learn about the OSI model layers and what each layer does. Good use of illustrations. Would be helpful to read before a test.Technical Remarks: Interesting use of fonts and background colors makes the site stand out.,3
1146,The homepage to the site was very bland.  There didn't appear to be much information there at first glance.  After using a few of the links it gave me a little more to look at.  ,3
1146,A grouping of links to a variety of web sites concerning the OSI model. The links would be of more use if they were organized in some manner along with comments.,3
1146,Link to Internet Technical Resources has very useful material and it is ease to use.  Although overall site is unorganized and some of the links does not work either.  No consistency for appearance of the site. ,4
1146,Easy to use website.  Site provides links and information about the OSI model and the function of each layer.,4
1147,"These online lectures provide good graphics and theoretical discussions, plus the use of applets to teach basic concepts in E&M.  Should be a very useful resource for those teaching the subject.  ",5
1148,"There are many applets that demonstrate similar principles, and this one is nothing specail.  The availability of the source code is a plus, however.",3
1149,"Excellent resource for pathology case studies tied to a collection of education from the University of Pittsburgh.  Recommend consideration of adding objectives, enhancing learner engagement through video or questions, and measurement or scoring of knowledge for learner/instructor use.

1150,"This is a fun site for everyone but is designed for beginner level French students or children. An excellent resource those who like to draw, and who tend to learn visually/aurally. I have used this site before for my class and everyone liked it and I believe that my students go back to it for fun.",5
1150,"A wide array of activities that beginning French students could use at home as an enjoyable review of artistic vocabulary and concepts! I would especially recommend the color palette activity and the reading of Le Corbeau et le Renard, both of which are accompanied by audio clips recorded by native French speakers.Technical Remarks:Overall, the site is very user friendly. A few of the activities in the ""jeux"" section (matching the holidays and matching the expressions) contained French words whose accents did not display themselves correctly on my computer. Also, the activity following the reading of Le Corbeau et le Renard would not allow me to fill in the missing pieces of the fable.",4
1150,"I reviewed this site for about 30 minutes on two separate occasions.  It was so fun I actually caught myself wanting to try more of the activities.  This is a great site for use in a French class at any age.  There was such a wide variety of activities that any group of students could find something valuable to try.  I do wonder, however, how often the material is either changed or added too.Technical Remarks: A small basic knowledge of the French Language is needed in order to sift your way through the site.  The activities are pretty simply to operate and there is room for error.  I especially enjoyed the fact that there was a short lesson before a small quiz on each area of material.  There is also opportunity to see the correct answer to any incorrect responses given.",5
1151,On Netscape (Solaris) this applet ran so fast as to be useless.,1
1152,"This site has several ""BrainGames"" including the Stroop Task and the Monty Hall Problem as well as the memory test.  These are nice interactive examples of heuristics although they could use more explanation as to how they relate to intro psych class material.",4
1153,"This site reinforced my previous exposure to e-portfolio creation for students and professionals. I think it was very helpful, especially for those who may not have an existing template.Technical Remarks: I spent less than an hour and found it to be reasonably user-friendly.",4
1154,"This is a great reference, simple and easy to understand I like this applet because I always have trouble with periodic table. But after I reviewed this applet, I got a better understanding of how to refer to periodic table and get the informatiojn I need effectively. I think this applet should be helpful to those who are currently taking any level of chemistry in school.",4
1155,The best and most interactive periodic table I've seen on the web.,5
1156,"This periodic table has a distinct advantage over others, namely the ability to compare properites f different elements.",5
1158,"Cheap trick to send us to iTunes for so-called professional material. Also, i agree with one of the comments made . . . that the images used to describe phobias are demeaning. Bad job here!",1
1159,"This famed course has an amazing effect on students.I have not used the material for my calsses, but have on occassion gifted the book to students who performed so well in my general physics course, and they found the materials extremely attractive.",5
1159,"I wrote a detailed review of this excellent, OER, on-line video course at http://blog.cjfearnley.com/2011/02/24/the-most-important-video-course-on-line-physics-c10ls-c70v-at-berkeley/",5
1160,"This activity is a great way to get middle school students interested in Physics.  It shows them the relevance of Physics to their lives by giving brief explanations of how everyday objects work using key Physics vocabulary.  This activity would be useful as an introduction into Physics that further lesson could be built off of.Technical Remarks:The program functioned with no diffulties and was easy to navigate.  The graphics aren't great, but they are good enough to peak student interest.",4
1161,"Very thoughtful presentation of many topics inmodern physics. Aimed at the nonscientist, theexplanations and applets complement each otherperfectly. The artwork, design, and writing areall professional. Definitely recommended for introductory physics students and educators.Technical Remarks:The applets are just sophisticated enough to get the point across, and no more. Nothingis overdone. The site is easy to navigate.",5
1162,Fantastic site.  Material is covered thoroughly.  Animations and lecture make it easy to incorporate into on-line courses or to enhance power point presentations.,5
1163,"These are extremely effective simulations.  The notes provided below each simulation are very accurate! There are lots of controls provided to change the input values.In fact, I had purchased similar software from a vendor around 2004 and had I known about the existence of these simulations at that time, I could have definitely saved some monies from my grant project. ",5
1164,"I spent something over an hour exploring this material, and highly recommend it.  This collection of problems, though useful in themselves, are perhaps even more useful as examples and/or templates for instructor-customized physlet problems. Most are of excellent quality.  Both qualitative and quantitative problems are included within the set.  Some are rather difficult, and will provide a challenge for very good students.  Others should be accessible to all students in an introductory course who take the time to think about them.  Most probe student understanding in ways not accessible to typical end-of-chapter problems.  Some work will need to be done by instructors to modify these (e.g., remove the answers, put randomness in the problems) if they are to be useful for graded homework, although they can be used as is for study self-study beyond the basic in-class presentation.",4
1165,"This collection of simulation pages is very useful in large part because of its breadth. Each is very focused, but as a whole the collection can be used to cover a year-long introductory physics class, plus some more advanced materials.Technical Remarks:The applets run well, and the update software is a bonus. There are one or two minor errors on some pages.",4
1166,This site was easy to use and very detailed about the topic.Technical Remarks:The use of color provided a guide to the site. ,4
1166,"This is a very detailed site with many diagrams/equtions. It shows geometry and fibonacci numbers in everyday use which makes it more exciting. It also gives info on the mathematician who came up with this concept/problem. A problem with the site is that if you are new to math, geometry, or finonacci numbers the language could be over your head.",4
1167,"This animation is a quick and dirty listing of the brain components through a song performed by Pinky and The Brain cartoon characters.  While the video is a bit humorous, it does not present a lot of material besides listing and identifying brain parts, although it is accurate in providing that content.Technical Remarks:It could be a fun way to start talking about brain structures and would definitely get students' attention.",4
1168,"An outstanding Paint Shop Pro Tutorial.  This is a site where the current ""bells and whistles"" of web graphics how to are displayed.  A MUST for any web graphic student.Technical Remarks: Cutting edge graphics in easy to understand terms.  One of the places I have bookmarked for times I need a new graphic trick.",5
1168,"Fabulous site with easy tutorials to the latest and greatest in interface graphics.  Very well explained. Technical Remarks: Fast to load, good for all levels. ",5
1169,"This WebQuest provides a framework for quartets to develop a cyberethic lesson, with each person assuming a role -- and associated resources. It would be useful to have more of a structure for the lesson design beyond the rubric.",3
1170,Great site to add videos to lectures,5
1171,"The Plants Database provides an excellent source for information on thousands of plants.  For example, there are more than 12,000 plants listed for the state of Oklahoma.  The site provides scientific and common names and classification from kingdom through species.  Many of the plants also have images of the stem, leaves, flowers, whole plant, etc. for identification purposes.  Almost all images have a high-resolution option which is great for showing the plant images on a large screen in the classroom.  As a faculty member, I've used this site many times in my Introduciton to Plant Science class/lab for plant identification.  I highly recommend this site!",5
1172,"This is a fun, hands-on resource for teachers to teach the concept of plate techtonics and pangea. The plan includes check for understanding and even student self-assessment! I would absolutely use this lesson with my students!",5
1173,Very easy to use.,4
1175,The electronegativity diagram (in the periodic table format) is very useful for chemists and very helpful in the class. ,4
1176,Great site for intro to biology class. I can see asking the students to bring a water sample from home aquariums and ponds and having them identify the algae in the water using basic microscopy techniques.,5
1176,this is a very helpful tool for a laboratory exercise since it allows the students to compare what they see under the microscope to what is in the chart. this allows for a more accurate identification of the specimen.,4
1177,"Looks pretty, but not much other information.  Links are not that bad to have and it sure is prettier than some I seen.",3
1178,Quite an interesting applet. Playing with the $k$ values to get a population of 250 million took some effort.,4
1179,"I found the website quite effective and useful in planning a lesson to be used in a classroom. I spent about a half- hour looking through the material, especially the posters. I found the quality very clear and easy to show in a PowerPoint presentation if I so desired. Visual and primary sources are a very important part of my teaching, so the website and clarity would be of great use. I think that first time users would find easy and enjoyable to navigate through this site.",4
1180,"A good all-around applet, with nice graphics and explanatory text.",4
1181,"As someone who supports faculty in the Quality Matters process, I am always looking for materials that help me help them.  What I like about this journal article is that it includes faculty comments from the experience, and not just those comments that ""support"" the QM process.  What I found disappointing about this article is the main recommendation ""that faculty open a discussion in their departments or schools about how to improve the instructional design of their online courses.""  I appreciate the provided prompts that followed this recommendation, but I was hoping for more concrete strategies to be implemented by faculty support, Deans, etc. as well. As this stands, the journal's main recommendation relies solely on faculty being interested in even having these conversations and taking on the workload to implement QM.  I would expect that surrounding this should be factors that support their time, efforts, and initiative in pursuing QM standards.",4
1182,Site directs to URL selling computer software and parts.  The URL is no longer valid.,1
1182,Very nice educational tutorial.  Appropriate for students at any level.  An overview of how to prepare and maximize .gif's and .jpg's.Technical Remarks: Tutorial only; no graphics or interaction.,4
1182,"I explored Preparing Graphics for the Web for approximately 45 minutes. The site provided a tutorial on JPEG and GIF file formats. I thought the tutorial might be appropriate for one of my classes where we learn basic skills in HTML and creating Web sites. The author?s goal was to balance theory with examples. The tutorial is for artists and graphic designers. It might work well with an advanced Web design course.The tutorial delivered what it promised - theory with examples. For the most part the theory was not too technical especially for the intended audience. Given the examples used and conversational writing style, I believe the tutorial would be very effective in conveying the differences between the two file formats. The tutorial also included some ?tips and tricks? that may be very helpful to the learner. The tutorial does an excellent job in illustrating the differences between the two file types and how each type of file is rendered in the browser. Technical Remarks: Navigating through the tutorial was easy. First time users should have not trouble navigating through the tutorial. Links to each section of the tutorial made it easy to view a topic in any order. Links within each section provided additional information or help. Anyone familiar with navigating Web pages will have no problems using the tutorial. The biggest problem with the tutorial is that it has not been updated since 1997. References to specific browser technologies are no longer appropriate. Compression techniques and capabilities have also changed since 1997. ",4
1182,"The quality of the content was great but more graphic examples would nice for the studnets.The information examples well the difference between the two formats. JPEG and GIFThe students, I believe, will able to find some of the information they need.  Navigation was easy.",4
1182," This resource is very informative about GIF and JPEG image formats.  The presentation of pros and cons as well as similarities and differences was well done.  Howerver, some of the information (especially concerning browsers and interlacing) is dated by the May 1997 date the information was developed.  I would use this site for students familiar with using images in HTML.  The author's early remark is important: ""It is assumed, or is at least quite helpful, that you have prior working knowledge of graphics design and image manipulation software applications and some familiarity with the GIF and JPEG image file formats.""",4
1183,"Exellent review of dermatology, very well done, love the quiz at the end!!",5
1184,"This is a hefty, well-organized text covering topics in micro & macroeconomics. It is current with up-to-date information. The chapters include Key Terms & Key Concepts, brief summaries of chapter sections. There are several types of questions: Self-Check: formative assessments & the only questions for which the answers are included (clickable in the web version of the text, & at the very end of the .pdf text version, by chapter), Review: open-ended recall, Critical Thinking: applications of the material in different contexts, Problems: analysis & computation. The text chapters have interesting features interspersed, promoting reader engagement. Bring It Home, brief case studies relating the chapter’s main topic to the real world; Link It Up, links to websites providing examples of what is being discussed, with a good mix of sites from the government, short news stories or articles & some very unusual ones. I have researched & used many sites in my classes but was pleased to see some new ones. Some of the links go to You Tube videos - a great idea - I wish more were included. Work It Out, a computation problem with a clear step-by-step solution; Clear It Up, a more complete explanation of a concept introduced in the text. These start with a question, a good strategy to entice students to read the section. There are colorful photos, charts & tables throughout the text so that the students are not bombarded with text. These improve the overall look & differentiate the text from others. The graphs in this text were a pleasant surprise, presented in a unique way with an interesting use of words intermingled with the lines & numbers. The senior contributing author & senior content expert have extensive experience teaching economics which is crucial to writing a practical text; otherwise, it is very difficult to know what students easily grasp & what they have more trouble with. The authors have taken that to heart in their writing & vary the coverage so that the typically ‘difficult’ areas have more in-depth treatment. I did have concerns about some of the material & coverage. For example, I thought the treatment of antitrust was a little sparse. I would like to see this expanded since this is an area that provides a nice connection between economics & history, sparking interest in students. I was disappointed that MPC & MPS were only covered in an appendix. I have found that this concept is very understandable to students & having it included in the regular text gives them a better grasp of Keynes & Fiscal Policy. I also felt that the treatment of the different types of firms could have been stronger with better examples.  I did not like the way perfect completion was handled in the questions as some would cause confusion for the students; for example, a Critical Thinking question that says “Assuming that the market for cigarettes is in perfect competition…” but the cigarette market is not perfect competition. I would rather not have any questions that mention cigarettes, unless it is talking about the negative externalities of second-hand smoke. Chapters start with a list of topics students will learn about, but I would rather see actual learning objectives. The questions in the .pdf text are more comprehensive than those in the web version. There were a few instances where data sources in tables were not cited & a few typos, but postings to the errata list for the text & suggested corrections are invited. Impressively, the text, originally published in 2014, has been updated as recently as 9/29/15. Overall, the text is very well done. ",5
1185,I probably spent about half an hour on here at least just looking at the videos and playing the games. The videos went through all sorts of problems which was definitely helpful for me. Videos are always a helpful thing for a right brained person like me. Some of the games put math into it so I wasn't just playing a game but I was using math also. I think this website would definitely help people learn math just by how it's all presented. You have to have the fun and the confidence boosters to help get through something that you may not like all that much. Everything is easy enough to find on this site.,4

Faculty and students can use this data bank for viewing current protein information or submitting new information to the site.,3
1193,"I developed an experiment on PsychExps with the considerable help of Ken McGraw and his team. Technical support was superb and the experiment works properly.  I have since included PsychExps as an extra credit assignment in a class and student feedback was favorable.  Although the site doesn't work with all computers (see below), it is easy to use with the right equipment.  I think PsychExps has a great deal of potential for enhancing teaching and learning and I recommend it highly.Technical Remarks: PsychExps seems to work best with PCs rather than iMacs, and Internet Explorer rather than Netscape. Occasionally, students using IE on a PC will report problems.  Although I don't understand why it sometimes doesn't work, Ken McGraw has developed a system for identifying and correcting these problems.",5

Your whole class can participate, and then download their own data and analyze it.  They can also download the data from students at other schools and compare.  Data are organized, using very nice macros written by the PsychExps team into Excel spreadsheets.  You can analyze from there, or import into SPSS.  Most demos have Teacher Guides associated with them.  They even have the Implicit Attitudes Test (IAT) that is becoming so popular.  I use this site regularly for my Research Methods class.Finally, there are also a number of ""real"" experiments in which researchers can collect their own data using the services of PsychExperiments.   Don't overlook these -- some are pretty darn interesting, even if they're not yet ""classics.""Technical Remarks: You must download Macromedia's Authorware Player (like Shockwave, but a little different).

A variety of sites are linked to provide thorough insight and varying perspectives on what is necessary for the interested undergraduate.,4
1198,I really enjoyed this page. It had very useful information presented in an intelligent way that was easy to understand and also easy to explore. The demonstrations were simple yet effective. I was able to search the site in a matter of minutes but spent some time reading the background information on the Pythagorean Theorem.

1208,"Applet works well, but would be more useful from a pedagogical standpoint if it was more quantitative.",4
1209,"Although I have not used this, I plan to add it to my classroom activities related to the Origin of Life.  The content is accurate and presented in a clear way that my students could follow.  It will be very helpful for visual learners - being able to see the step by step process of the Miller-Urey Experiment and explanations.  The site is well organized and easy to follow.  It could be used in class or as a supplemental study aid, or a combination of both.Because this is a self contained activity, students in my online class could easily access it.  It might be valuable to add a worksheet or study guide to draw attention to the important concepts.Technical Remarks:I did not encounter any technical problems or difficulties.",5
1211,"Jessica - This is much better than the first draft.  Your intro is really engaging and should make readers want to find out the specific you provide.  You've also done a great job integrating your observations of students ""turning sketches into reality"" and ""translating knowledge into a practical application.""  I also like the learn from errors affordance of video you added.  The ""Wooden Models of Simple Machines"" section is really helpful detail for prospective users of this plan, too.  

Nice job!",4
1212,"Ribistar is an excellent tool for teachers. It guides them in the process of creating and editing rubrics. Teachers follow the given steps to produce a rubric for their subject areas.

1222,Good resource for embryology lab.Technical Remarks:No technical requirements.,4
1223,I use this video in Introduction to Psychology to help students understand the somatosenory cortex.  I have also used it in Health Psychology to discuss phantom limb pain.,5
1224,When teaching cross-sectional anatomy I find the most difficult part is to get the student to understand the different planes and how they relate to eachother.  This is a great tutorial that shows multiple planes of the thorax to help students correlate the different planes together so they can better understand the anatomy as a 3-dimensional object and not a flat 2-dimensional picture.,4
1225,I plan to use this in my next Introduction to the Internet class. This is a great tool to help students learn about browsers and how to select a browser to use on their computer. I generally spend time showing each browser but this will save me a lot of time. Lots of additional resources that explain Internet technology and terminology.Technical Remarks:Very professional. Everything in the presentation works well; the links work correctly and navigation user friendly.,5

I also like the narration audio, as I think the narration grabs the learners attention.  It fits many UDL principles by incorporating interesting visuals, audio and learning resources.   I found it instructional, as I have often wondered what the major differences were between the various web browsers.   At no point did I feel confused about what to do.  The links all worked well and I found the format to be clean and professional.Technical Remarks:Worked as intended.",4
1225,"I thought the structure of this resource was very well designed.  Brian did a great job of teaching users how to actually navigate his resource.  The learning goals and objectives were clearly spelled out right from the start, and learners knew not only what they would learn, but in what sequence they would learn the material.  I also felt like the summaries at the bottoms of the pages were helpful in making sure I understood the goal of each individual page.  The links and videos were also helpful in giving another avenue to access the information.  These added links fell within the UDL principles and allowed the user to access the information in a different way and get clarification on terms or concepts that may be difficult to understand.  As was the case with the clearly laid out objectives at the start of the lesson, I felt that it was extremely helpful to have those same goals re-stated at the end as a wrap up.  Overall the design of this instructional resource was great and would be a meaningful learning tool.Technical Remarks:The resource worked really well and the icon guide at the start was very helpful for navigation.  The only problem was that it would not play in safari. When I clicked the link from my email on my mac it only opened the file in preview.  I may have my download preferences set  incorrectly, but it worked just fine on my pc.",4

Each page has its own strengths.",4
1226,This item has been triaged and will not be peer reviewed by the Teacher Education Editorial Board.,4
1226,"This is one of the sites I often refer students to who are just beginning to take coursework for their special education credentials.  At first glance, it seems to just be a listing of links to different subject areas.  Because it is continually updated and linked to some outstanding sites, it becomes a very valuable tool.  Sites are categorized by disability area and by different types of available resources.Technical Remarks: Each site that is linked to this site has its own technical requirements.",4
1227,The materials are very engaging specially for young audience. It also provide the legal definition of the three types of sexual harassment with  a situationer of each type which used to measure the knowledge gain by the expected audience.,5
1228,"Overall, the presentation is a good resource for drill and practice.  Though for students who may have difficulty reading or hearing, one might want to add sound to the slides.  Also, some directions could be displayed or read aloud to the learner to lessen confusion regarding what is to be done when the presentation begins.  Special effects embedded in the wording might distract the learner.  Addtionally, the slide for question 7 within the quiz had wording that went off the screen, which results in the  learner not being able to read the question completely. Finally, the presentation was very colorful and had very good information for the learner.Technical Remarks:Each of the slides connected to the correct slide. All links worked. However, some of the special effects made it a little distracting and time consuming.",4
1229,These series of videos clearly explains the different types of shock in a very simplified manner. The use of the board for drawing while explaining the types of shock provides very valid and accurate depictions of what is being explained. Providing the visual representation enhances the learning process and always users to have a pictorial view of how shock manifest in the human body. This method of teaching is very captivating and makes the user interested in learning more about shock.

1232,"A large host of applets, each of which worked well.  There are also links to more applets, with source code available.  ",4
1233,"I spent 20 minutes reading the site on Newton.  I spent time on each of the 3 parts of his life that the site listed.  I thought this site was perfect for the life of Newton, it was complete enough and at the same time wasn't dragged on with worthless material.  It described his life as a child all the way up to when he was knighted and a learder of the University.  It talked a lot on his contributions to the math world and what he has published and how he has changed math and science.  I thought this was a good site to learn about Sir Isaac Newton.  I used this to assist on my midterm, which was about Newton.  The facts were true and backed up.  I think a student can learn a lot from this site if they are looking to learn of Newtons life and the significance ithas to the world of math.  I think first time users will get this site easily.  I found it very simple to understand, the author turned a difficult subject into one that is quite easy to understand.  I feel this was a good biography of one of the most sifnificant mathematicians in history.",5
1233,It took me a few tries to get the hang of this web sight but once I figured it out I think this will be a very useful tool for me to get references in the future,4
1233,"This biography is brief, but the website provides other sites and reference materials.  Since Sir Isaac Newton is considered the greatest English mathematician of his time, I found his biography to be quite interesting.  I reviewed this site for about thirty minutes to learn more about Newton, and also to determine if I could use the information for my current math class.  Since there are 271 books/articles in the list of references, I believe the information is accurate.Technical Remarks:If a student wants to learn more about Sir Isaac Newton, I would recommend this website.  Eventhough the biography is short, you can use all of the referenced sites.  If used appropriately sudents' learning and faculty's teaching will be enhanced.  All of the data is available on this site to accomplish this.",4
1233,"The page was very informative. It is a brief biography on Newton, nice feature is that there are links @ the bottom if you would like additional information on his work.Technical Remarks:Nice search engine @ the top of page",4
1233,Found everthing I needed about math. The history of math is pretty intense. It help me understand the subject a bit more.,5
1233,"After spending around 15 minutes fully looking through the site and the links, I can say that this site is pretty disappointing, especially for a topic that I would surmise to be pretty popular. The landing page is essentially only links, which lead to other sites with no real way to navigate back to the landing page. Once you click on a link, you are taken to a different page which seems to cause browser issues. The only real way to approach this site is to open each link in different tabs (or browser windows, if you prefer) to avoid the hassle of navigating through multiple pages and losing your place. Overall, this page is really not very user-friendly, which is a hindrance on judging its content. The content is good, not amazing; the lack of original content is a real downgrade. There is not a lot of information related to Newton's achievements or mathematical studies. Most of the content is in the form of external links, which is mostly just a hassle for any average user, and any student trying to find information about Newton would probably be better off going to a different site.Technical Remarks:Very poor layout, links lead to external sites or pages within the site, with no easy way to navigate back to the landing page. Navigation is very poor and content of the page is disappointingly minimal, with very little unique content.",2
1233,I took about 20 minutes going through the material on Sir Isaac Newton.  I have done a presentation on him in my current math class and I wiiiiissssshhh i had seen this before so I would have had more info!! Very informative and helpful! Clear and easily read,4
1233,"This is great! My sister was looking for a good reference for Sir Isaac Newton.
I spent about fifteen minutes skimming through the page. I notice that there are a lot of links to different sites containing specific information on Newton. This site will definitely help those who are researching him because there's no need to read through a whole entire page to find what information is needed. This definitely simplifies the research by a lot!
Students will definitely make good use of this site because it effective because there are a total of 271 articles/books for references on the site :)",5
1233,"This topic is more then likely my most favorite of the forums. Sir Isaac Newton is arguably one of the most ingenious people to have roamed the earth in the last 500 years. This site is a great homage to the great man and his achievements in the sciences and mathematics. I have actually, throughout my education, done several biographies of him and have a great appreciation of him before hand. I think that this topic was very well researched and was very effective when communicating information about Sir Isaac Newton.",5
1233,i look over this information for a few minutes. there is good info about newton. it would help students and teachers because it has references to books and articles. it is very easy to find what u want.,4
1233,I spent about 15-20 min on this site. This site has a lot of information non Isaac in depth. This would have been a great research site for my classes Math G project. This site is easy to learn from you just need to read and take in the info about Newton. This will definently give you the info you need.,5
1233,"This is a very interesting article that I could spend a good amount of time learning more about.  This section on Newton has a lot of solid material that highlights not only major mathematical advance that Newton contributed, but also some of his beliefs.  Before browsing this I had some knowledge on Newton and his advances in the Calculus field, but didn't know anything about his religious beliefs and statements.  The information doesn't seem too crammed together, making it much easier to absorb.  If you showed someone this that had no backround on the history of Newton, I am sure that it wouldn't be too hard for them to pick up the focal points and information.  The links are very basic and easy to find.  Theres no time wasted looking for what you want to know or find out about.",4
1233,"This is a website I would definitely use to do any kind of research on Sir Issac Newton. The first page you are at is a clear easily read introduction on who Issac Newton was. This page is easily accessible and gives you options of what you want to look at. There are links for other sites with more information, quotes, and even a link to a page with more famous mathematicians that you can do any kind of research on. The bulk of the site is the depth biography of Issac Newton. After reading the biography that is on the site I feel I know ALOT more than I did before, and I did not have to read a whole book or surf many websites. This summery gives a chuck of information but it is also not overwhelming. This is a good place to start to do any kind of research paper on Sir Issac Newton. This is a kind of website that a student can look at on their own time, and a teacher would not need to use any of the resources to teach a class.Technical Remarks:Very easy to read and navigate through.",4
1233,When reviewing this material i spent about 30 min reading the history of Sir Isaac Newton. i feel that he is a great english mathematician of his time and he contributed alot to his foundation by educating the rest of the world his beliefs and theories.the content in this article is very informative about how he came of interst in mathmatics and Isaac's background. The information provided has some really great concepts and models of optics and light also his scientific discoveries. i think that students and faculty will get a lot of knowlege of Isaac Newton and what he practiced. I think its a great learning tool and many students can gain a new outlook toward Isasac Newton and what he accomplished over the years and how it still affects us today. The ease of using this material is really great. It can be easily accessed and the individual can explore many aspects of Sir Isaac Newton,5
1233,This is an exceptional biography page.,4
1233,"I read a lot about Isaac Newtons achievement when I was in high school, but I havent read his bio yet. So, after I spend more than an hour reading I realize that I love to read the famous peoples bio. Its interesting to find out that Isaac, a talented person, has a normal life like us. He has a tragedy childhood, moderate college score. He was an inactive student.  After reading an astrology book, he found that he could not understand the mathematics in it; therefore, he read and learn math a lot, which is an important element for him to get many achievements later and become a famous scientist. Moreover, This article includes many  theories and discoveries of Newton such as: theory of light and color(Newton's ring, diffraction of light), theory of universal gravitation,and three laws of motion. beside it, he can explain a lot of unrelated phenomena like ecentric orbits of comets, tides and their variations, motion of the Moon as perturbed by the gravity of the Sun.
  Also,this site includes many links relate to Issac and other mathematicians, math history,so it is a good resource for you to do research paper.",5
1233,"As part of my math class assignment, I was browing through learning materials, then the topic ""Sir Isaac Newton"" caught my eyes. I have strong interest in learning great, famous people's bio, but never read Newton's bio before because I thought it would be boaring reading. I was wrong. I spent 40 minutes reading, and each minute I was viewing his life on a big screen tv. It is so live, so interesting, so real. Newton had a life just like normal people, his childhood tragedies, his mid life in college, his carrier, his politics, everything shows his life was just like us. I think this is great reading material because it's not about the (boring) theories or formula's. It's about behind the sceen story of those. Newton's life is told very simple and interesting way, so I was not bored and I think most people won't. Readers will have a chance to learn about Newton and his work in a pleasant way.Technical Remarks:Navigation was pretty easy. No confusion. So I don't think first time users will have any issue.",5
1233,"I found this site very interesting because I have read a lot about Newtons Laws in my high school Physics class but I never knew his biography. It took me about an hour to read and explore Newtons biography and his achievements and awards. This site gave a very clear picture of Sir Isaac Newtons life and his famous achievements and Honor Awards. He was really a great guy who loved Mathematics, optics, physics, and astronomy. This site is very effective for enhancing teaching because anyone can use it for a research on Newtons life and learn something from it. This site is very easy to use for those who have very good computer knowledge and it could be hard for the first time users because they would have to do some hunting before getting to know how to use it. For me it took a little time to explore and then I got a good hang of it.",5
1233,"I skimmed the first part of the website and read the second half.  The first part of the article seemed rather unhelpful to me because it was more on his personal life, rather than his contributions to the mathematical world.  There seemed to be an abundent amount of redundant information- although the picture of the manor was interesting, it had little importance.  However, at the end of the article there is a list of areas in which he had managed to contribute to.  Clicking on these sites were much more influential in my understanding of  the  actual mathematics he touched than the article. Technical Remarks: This site is as easy to use as the internet gets.",3
1233,"As I was researching topics for my Final Paper for my Math G class and I came across Sir Isaac Newton. I spent about one hour reading about him and looking up other related sites. I learned a lot about Sir Isaac Newton reading this site, I learned about his life and about this family. There was also a lot of information about his interest for mathematics and ideas. This acticle would be a good source of information for any kind of paper or project. The material I thought was very easy to understand. Overall Sir Isaac Newton is a very fascinating man. ",4
1233,"I spent about 10min browsing. The content amount is perfect for assistance in writing a paper. Everything that I would need to know about Newton is there in an easy to read format. You can also hit the links if you need to go into more detail on a certain aspect of his life, or if you need to research a particular accomplishment. ",5
1233,I am doing my final paper on Astronomy so this page also caught my attention. I printed this page out and skimmed it for about 20 minutes. I high lighted whatever info I though might be useful to final paper. I was really surprised to find out some stuff that I didn't know about Sir Isaac Newton. Most text books have a lot of information on his laws and discoveries but not much about his life as this page did. This software was really to use even for the first time.,4
1233,"Sir Isaac Newton is obviously a fascinating man. He has been apart of many scientific and mathematical achievements that make him a respected figure in his areas of study. This site is basically an overview and a history of Newton?s life. It breaks his life down in to three periods: His childhood (1643-1669), his days as Lucasian professor at Cambridge (1669-1687), and lastly 1687 until the day he died. This website presents a lot of information, which makes it difficult to take in all in at one time. It does however offer a great overview of Newton?s life and clearly explains the main achievements in it. I found that it was necessary for me to read this article about three times, but that is only because it is a lot of information to take in at one time. This site is useful for not only math but for history as well. This site is an excellent source of material and seems very creditable. ",4
1233,The information that I understood about the Great Sir Issac Newton was kind of remarkable to me because of the simple fact that everyone told him one thing and he proved another and he beileved and later proved his facts. I think that people who challange the status quo are the ones who change the world. He did just that and the information was very interesting. I read and read for about 30 minutes and it was very easy to navigate through and intersting to me. I recommend everyone read this one.Issac Newton was a very interesting genuis.Technical Remarks: It was pretty easy to navigate through the site.,5
1233,"after reading the material about Sir Isaac Newton i found the quality of the information was very good, short simple and very to the point.  it decribed enough of his life and achievments to make for a decent report and great history.  this site as a education tool would be good and useful cause it is so easy to use and understand the contents of the material.",5
1233,"This program will be a great help for me in the future. I will be doing a report Sir Isaac Newtoon for my math class.  This program had alot of text, which is good if you want information for a report.  But, if someone just wanted to mess around and have fun with math; I would suggest working with a different program.  The program was very easy to use, and had links for other people that effected Isaac's life.  I found the text to be interesting and educational.  The profile of Issac was well written and simple to understand.       ",4
1233,I find this Biograpoh of Sir Isaac Newton very intresting and informative. I printed the story our and read it my own pace. I then when back and checked out the links to other that had influanced him. I then past on the printed one to my son who then went on to explore the Merlot site himself.,5
1233,"I've always been impressed by the Sir Isaac Newton and what he contributed to the world itself. I spend almost an hour reading his article and the others that had also influenced him. I find all the materials that were provided/given very significant to the subject. It is indeed effective to everyone learning the life of Sir Isaac Newton...and all other mathematicians and philosophers that had made impact in his life as well. As for first time users, there's nothing to be confused about because this is a very friendly software; it seemed made to enjoy exploring and learning.",5
1233,i spent about 30 min on this trying to understan him.  he seemed like a smart man that gave a lot to are society.  he was a very bite person.  for me i had to read over it 2-3 times tor get a better understanding of the reading.Technical Remarks: i think that this was hard because i do not know how to understand this reading.,2
1233,"The first time I heard of Newton is when I was told an interesting story about him. An idea about gravitation was poped up in his mind when he looked at an apple falling off the tree. This story really hooked me up. Later on, I learnt many of his theories in physic and math at school. They are all formulas and numbers, and they are not attracting. Thus, when I read this article, I know more interesting things about his life and his contributions to sciences, which I haven't learnt at school.This article is written in a coherent order, so it doesn't take me much time to read and understand. The content is well imformed and educational. It describes Newton as an inactive student at school. However, he becomes the great scientist later, and he is the first one who was knighted by the Queen for his tremendous work. That's amazing! The article also tells us how he achieves his accomplisments, step by step, and this is exciting part to students who want to know more about the great scientist's work. This article includes many well known theories and discoveries of Newton such as: theory of light and color(Newton's ring, diffraction of light), theory of universal gravitation,three laws of motion. And through these discoveries, he can explain a lot of unrelated phenomena like ecentric orbits of comets, tides and their variations, motion of the Moon as perturbed by the gravity of the Sun. Finally, this article is suitable for those who want to do a research or to learn about life and accomplishments of Isaac Newton. Besides the article, this site also supports lots of links to other mathematicians,
 math history, cross-references to history topics, famouse curves, which are convinient for your further reference. This site is easy to acess, and control. It loads fast and looks nice.",4
1233,"I spent about 45 min. on this site.The content was nery interesting who he made a great deal on contribution to many different subjects of math such as physics(the apple and the tree).  I found it easy to read and it told a good timeline of his life from his youth to his older years. Technical Remarks:I think this site would be great to use in the class room weather it's giving an over view of his life or used in project by a student. As far as using the software i think it might be a little confusing for first time users but i think they figure it out, but i didn't really have a problem using the software so it",5
1233,I was on this site for about 40 min.  I've heard of Sir Issac Newton before in an astronomy class.  This site gave a good over of his life and accomplishments.  It was intresting to hear he was an outcast and people thought he didn't want learn but really he turned out to be a smart man who made many contributions.Technical Remarks: The site was real easy to use and that was good for me because I not real good with computers.,4
1233,"I spent about 45 min. reviewing the site. I found it very interesting because I think what he did was great. The site did a great job going over his background, and a good description of him.I think that this would be good info for students to learn from.The material was easy to use. I don't use computers very much and I seem to be doing just fine.",4
1233,"I spent about 90 minutes comparing Dr. Connor's extremely well written essay to other historical texts about the life of Isaac Newton.  Dr. Connor and Professor Robertson quite correctly set the scene for Newton's career by emphasizing his very early passion for learning.  Newton did, however, show little brilliance until he attended Cambridge University and came under the influence of the great mathematician Isaac Barrow.  He very soon began his investigations into the composition of light and inaugurated his work on the law of universal gravitation.  This was really a culmination of the theories of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo, and Newton was able to piece together a coherent set of rules for the universe.  Newton set forth the basic concepts of mechanics by elaborating the three laws of motion and he also provided the real fundamental meaning of life by introducing his four rules of Reasoning in Philosophy.     This was an interesting read and Dr. Connor and Professor Robertson were right on in their approach to showing the three distinct periods of Newton's amazing life.  I would recommend that this be presented to any math class as a character standard for those future mathematicians willing to dedicate themselves to Newton's philosophy.Technical Remarks:      It is very easy to click onto Newton.  It is equally easy to enjoy many other related web sites and I would recommend ""Orbits and Gravitation"" and ""Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge.""",5
1233,"1)I spent about 20 min reviewing this site.I found it very knowledgeable and interesting.2)The quality of the content was very understandable and there was a lot of it. If any one I knew needed more info on Sir Isaac Newton. I would definetely tell them about this site.3) I feel that using this information posted here will surely enhance effectiveness for teaching, and students learning because there is alot of information about Newton's life and his acheivements.4) It was very easy for me to use this site for valuable information, so there for I feel it would be easy for first time users such as myself.

1233,I spent around 25 minutes viewing the material on Isaac Newton.  The information about his youth days were interesting and also the various things that he studied.  The information was also easy to understand and would be good for a student.  I didn't have much trouble getting into the program even though I'm not good with computers.,4
1233,"I gave this site the highest rating because it was interesting, and fun. It was mostly history of Sir Isaac Newton, and well I love history.  The information was clear and easy to fallow.  One thing that I really liked was that the math didn't really go into depth and therefore it wasn't boring.  It took me about an hour to read the whole site, but I didn't mind.  I recommend this site to all those who like history.  The site talked about Geometry, Optics, Physics, which students all over the world are using, and Sir Isaacsa?? accomplishments.  I do think that first time users will find the site easy to use and follow.",5
1233,"This was quite a long and worded article.  Even though Newton?s life deserves much recognition for his accomplishments in the field of physics and gravity, I feel this article could have expanded on those accomplishments a little more.  Too much was included on his early childhood and his development in school.  Even though he began to get interested in mathematics after reading Euclid?s Elements, the article spends too much time on events leading to this point.  It was interesting to read about his controversial writings and how it affected other scientists and mathematicians at the time. After reading the article, I found Newton to be quite a colorful and a fascinating person. ",4
1233,The Information about Sir Isaac Newton was kind of remarkable about how he was kind of an outcast of his society which most great leaders are. He was quiet a remarkable individual. I thought the software was easy to navigate through and made it easy on the user. I also browsed for about 45 minutes and was just in awe of his accomplishments and the way he challanged everything. Very inpressive site.,4
1233,"This was an easy to read article. I loved all of the information on his interaction with other famous people in the math field of his time. Knowing what influenced his skills and passions was informative too. Even his lack of interest in school when he was younger was helpful in understanding him, along with his bouts with depression.",5
1233,"The overall information regarding Newton's background was enlightening.  One always wonders what goes on before a historical figure enters college.  Also the information on where Sir Isaac Newton retained his knowledge, how he was accepted and unaccepted in society is very interesting.  I did not skim this material, I took my time reading about his childhood, education, and life thereafter.  Technical Remarks: The way that the information was provided was a little bland.  If there was a colorful background, or the information was arranged more interestingly.  Otherwise, it was highly effective in getting Sir Isaac Newton's life events across to the reader.",4
1233,1. i had spent about an hour looking over the materials at hand. 2. The content was excellent it had so many facts on Sir Issac Newton it was just incrediable. telling the reader more facts then what they probably thought about what Issac Newton done.3. it is so easy for someone to read this and if i ever needed some information on Sir Issacc Newton this would be a good place to start.4. for first time users it would be so easy to understand the information that is given.,5
1233,"The software is extremely easy to follow. The content is around 80% of what a freshman student needs to know about the subject.The content is also very well conected to other related subjects. I spend around 2 minutes to learn how the site is organize, and about thirty minutes scanning the material.It is absolubtly awesome that as student I can have acces to so much information, is like having five well rounded tutors ritgh on my desk at the same time.Isaac Newton was a remarkable man just his studies about the theory of gravitation, is enough to make us grateful to God for him. He did'nt stop there, his developments in calculus and his personal carreer making a very good leader.",5
1233,"I spent about 15 minutes reviwing this article on Sir Issac Newton. This was a very informative Biography detailing his life from childhood to death. I had a little trouble following some of the terminolgy. A good thing was the author gives many outlets with information on these things. The information in this site is great if your doing a report on Sir Issac Newton or if your teaching a class about him. For first time users it may be a little hard to read, you have to have some prior knoledge about math to understand some of the information discussed. ",4
1233,"After actually trying to link to this website, the time it took me was about 30 minutes to review this material.  The information given was interesting and full.  His quotes ""my best friend is truth"" showing that he was a free thinker from an early stage.  It was interesting to learn how he discovered that white light is really a mixture of different types of rays at different angles.  If I had a paper on this man I would not need any other material, its all on this website and it is very easy to understand.Technical Remarks: I had a little bit of difficulties getting into the link, because I am not very good in computers, but after doing it the first time, it was easier.",5
1233,"For the last hour I enjoyed reading and exploring the biography of Sir Isaac Newton. It is fascinating to know that such great scientist did not do really well in school at first, and that his interest in Mathematics did not arrive until later on in his life.The article contains much valuable information about Newton, his personal life, and his scientific journey, as well as hyperlinks to those who played a roll in his life.I think the article is well written, and very educational for an average reader like me.I also applaud the author for his smooth writing skills and the exciting style that leads the reader from one step in Newton?s life to another. This article rocks!Sam",5
1233,I spent about 15 minutes looking at the material.  It had a lot of good information that I did not know.  If a student were to sit down and use this program it would help them.  I was confused getting into the program at first but then I got it.  But I'm terrible with computers.,4
1234,"Sketchbook Express for the iPad is a very solid art app for free. You have access to a variety of brushes, three layers for working, color selection, and more. There is the Sketchbook Pro version which costs $4.99 and gives you access to far more tools, but if you are just starting out or are working on iPads in classroom setting this is a very reasonable app for starting and teaching basic art concepts with digitial media.Technical Remarks:Compatible with the iPad. Requires iOS 5.0 or later.",4
1235,"The Smarthistory site is a very impressive collection of resources covering over 2000 years of art. Comprising high quality videos and clearly written and informative text-based resources, the site is organised around four main areas: Time, Style, Artist and Themes.The video and text resources available range from beginners level guidance on intrepreting and describing artworks, through to chronologically ordered overviews of specific time periods and much more narrowly focused case studies of individual works. The works chosen often differ from those commonly found in art history texts and offer a stimulating and engaging access point to the context in which each work was produced and the themes and issues addressed in the work.Educators should find Smarthistory offers great potential as a source of resources for use in classroom teaching. Smarthistory could also be useful for educators wishing to set learners a guided research task using the site. Independent learners should also find Smarthistory easy and rewarding to use.  The content is academically credible and of a high standard.Technical Remarks:The site navigation takes a little getting used to due to the quantity of information available.",5
1236,The Smithsonian American Art Museum provides interactive exhibits of many of their exhibits.  Beautiful photography. ,5
1237,"Not all of the information here is accessible to non-members (specifically journal articles). The most valuable teaching materials are actually available through BrainFacts.org, and these vary significantly in the target age group. 
The teaching resources are a little clunky, with many links to follow to other websites.
The best use I have for these materials is using them as supplemental/additional resources. They touch on core topics, though not to the degree I expect my college students to learn. With that said, these materials (through BrainFacts.org) are most appropriate for introductory students.",3
1237,"This is the website for The Society for Neuroscience.  It contains many articles, teaching resources and links.  There is a lot of information here.",5
1238,A veritable testing bible.  Excellent source for software testing information.  The index format makes it easy to jump to a specific topic or just read through the many aspects of testing presented.  This site is a must have reference for any test creator.,5
1238,"I used this material for 1 hour after one of my graduate students reviewed and recommended it during the Fall 2001 semester. The material is a tutorial on software testing, which is organized as a hypertext document. It also contains several diagrams. The document includes two sections: software testing techniques and software testing strategies. Testing techniques cover White Box Testing, Basis Path Testing, Control Structure Testing, Black Box Testing, and Static Program Analysis. Testing strategies include unit, integration, validation and system testing.The material is concise, accurate and easy to understand. It can be used to supplement the textbook in undergraduate and graduate software engineering courses.Technical Remarks:The material was very easy to use and no problems were encountered in its use.",4
1239,It is great to know that a text that can be expensive is provided online. It is a great informational text about soil. I did not read all of it but skimmed through the chapters. THis is something I will want to use as a useful material in my classroom when teaching students about soil. Students will be able to have this resource available to them at home and at the same time I can have students learn about soil on the computer. It is interactive and beneficial for students. It is perfect because the chapters online point out key points that should be known. The website also provides the information of the text if interested in purchasing.Technical Remarks:Very effective and easy to get around.  The sup topics are available. The left side provides a tab for the chapters/concepts as well as the top.,4
1240,The 7th chord drills are useful practice. Having the correct answer show when an answer is entered wrong would be of learning value. It would be nice to see an update so more than half of the drills can be used. Technical Remarks:The software used is outdated for half of the site. It would be nice to see an upgrade. ,3
1240,"Content is good, but it would be great to allow me some time to see where I went wrong, instead of proceeding to the next question after 15secs. Concerns about emailing the results..to anyone.Technical Remarks:Obvously built sometime ago. The interface could use some modern touches, and I would remove any of the hypercard materials that are now obsolete.",3
1241,"Jeff Powers, Solve a 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle lesson plan effectively delivers required math curriculum to early elementary students in a fun and engaging format.  The instructional strategy scaffolding is used to deliver the lesson by first showing students an empty Sudoku chart, then explaining key vocabulary and basic rules. This is followed by teacher modeling and guided practice. Some of the UDL principles represented in this lesson plan include 1) defining vocabulary and symbols 2) varying levels of challenge and support and 3)provide varied ways to interact with materials. One area that I think the lesson plan could be improved in is in the method to deliver the lesson.  Students are given options to practice solving puzzles with paper and pencil or on a computer website (three hyperlinks are provided by the author.) I think a third option of using manipulatives would improve the plan. My idea would be to use refrigerator magnet numbers set up on a metal cookie sheet in Sudoku puzzle fashion.  This would help some students learn the process. I also think the lesson plan added to MERLOT would be more eye-catching if an image were included on the description page. Solve a 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle is a very meaningful and worthwhile lesson for students.  In addition to satisfying Math G.L.C.E.’s, solving puzzles like these are simply good brain exercise!",4
1241,"Great lesson Plan, I feel that it can also be used at the secondary level as well.  Many students still do not understand the process of reading rows and columns.",4
1242,"I enjoyed completing your StAIR project. The project was nicely laid out, all the links worked as intended, and there was a clear path that the project was taking the learner. I feel that the scaffolding and support in your project was very helpful. The pace was quick, but those resources will help if the student needs more time with the material. The quizzes were beneficial, and I like that you used Quizlet for them. I had no problem getting back to the presentation after completing the quizzes. The pictures were great, and the sounds were entertaining and intriguing. What I liked most in your project was the use of animation to guide the learner along. I liked that you added step by step animation on how to complete each objective, and then asked the learner do the same on a piece of paper. Technical Remarks:Technicallly, everything worked as well. No links were broken and no problems occured during the completion of the StAIR. Nice job!",5
1242,Excellent addition to MERLOT,5
1242,"Mariah,Overall, I think this is a great review tool, easy to use and very clear, very methodical, a solid review of the material. I can see this being very useful, and can be used outside of class. I spent about an hour going through and taking notes.For future reference when working with Powerpoint, you can copy a screen that has the basic stuff you need on it – such as titles and navigation keys – so that everything is in the exact same place. It looks better when the user goes from screen to screen.In the maths practice, I wonder whether it would be worthwhile to have the students write the answers down on a piece of paper before revealing them on screen.  Similarly, when doing problems, do you want students to have to do them before moving on, or is it okay not to? If so, you can build that in, i.e. when they get the right answer, they go to a screen that moves them forward, but otherwise they stay on that problem.  That is partly an issue of your navigation. It seems that the entire screen is clickable, and not just the navigation keys, i.e. clicking anywhere moves me forward.It might be good to give specific feedback when a student gets an answer wrong, to help her in the right direction. For example, you give an equation and then ask whether we should Add 4 or Subtract 4. If the student chooses the wrong one, perhaps you could say something like “If 4 is being added in the equation, how would we remove it?”I think you assume a certain reading speed when you have the next step automatically appear. Believe it or not, it was quick for me the first time as I was reading word for word, and I wonder if it might be too quick for students who don’t read or process as quickly. At the same time, for the quick readers or students who understand already, it will be too slow. Here again, you could have them move forward by clicking when they are ready.I love that you have included yourself reading explanations. I would add a note at the beginning when you talk about navigation that students can click on the speaker to hear you read the explanation. I wold even add more of that.THat could be very helpful for certain students.I’m curious as to why you did the quizzes in Quizlet instead of in the STAIR itself; in the STAIR you could provide feedback and explanations.Last, when a user goes to a website, at least on my machine, a Macbook Pro, it doesn't automatically take me back to the Powerpoint presentation; I have to look for Powerpoint. You might include that explanation in the navigation as well.Technical Remarks:Technically it works without flaw, though screens move forward clicking anywhere, rather than only on the forward arrow. Also, when leaving the presentation to go to a website, on my machine - a Macbook Pro - I am not brought back to the presentation; I have to find the Powerpoint icon. This is not a fault of this presentation, but of Powerpoint.",4
1243,"Like the rest of the sites in the author's collection, this site is very   informative, clear, and uses nice graphics (some animated) to illustrate the  points.   Very extensive discussion.  For a nontechnical discussion, this site should be very helpful.",5
1244,"A simple animation, yet still informative.  Good explanation.",3
1245,"I liked this website a lot because I can download any digital audio lecture file that I want to listen to free of charge. Also, I am studying podcasting and this site is a good example of how to create my future podcast.",5
1245,"This is a fantastic idea. It was always known that in education we had to come up with something engaging, trendy and interesting enough to keep the students¿ attention. Technology is changing rapidly, so the students¿ attitude toward school and what school can offer in terms of quality education and prosperity is changing accordingly. By having the opportunity to download, listen, see and podcast lectures, any type of learner can benefit from and enhance the learning process. 
Branka SaracTechnical Remarks:It is very easy to navigate through.",5
1246,This learning object seems good for a general overview but is not sufficient as the only source for learning about general psychology concepts.  It does have some great material and is very to the point (which is the purpose of the site) but because of that it omits lots of important information as well.  Not a bad presentation of learning material overall thought.Technical Remarks:A general web browser.,4
1247,"URL should be http://ir.chem.cmu.edu/irproject/applets/spectro/default.asp.  This is a very impressive applet, which demonstrates P, Q, and R branches of diatomic molecule spectra in a way that would be helpful to anyone teaching the subject.",5
1248,"How you reviewed the materials:The material is pretty straight forward, so I didn't feel it required a great deal of trying to realize its capabilities and possible uses.The quality of content:The computations are accurate, and much more easily attained than through calculation by hand, plus you don't have to worry about making stupid mistakes.The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning:This is a very effective simulation, because of its quick use and its simplistic design.The ease of using the materials:It was extremely easy to use. Because of its design and purpose, it didn't require any instructions, and the values it required most likely wouldn't require any calculation. Critical values are just pulled from a table, and the pressure and temperature are most likely given.",5
1249,"The app is user friendly, featuring simple language, colorful visuals, and the ability to tailor the settings from easy to medium based on the child’s progress. All of the previous factors are the pros, but there are a few drawbacks. There are two versions, a free one and the other that costs $4.99. The free one, while still great, does not feature the superb visuals seen in the $4.99 one. Also, the free version is not free from third party advertisement. All in all, the app is worth either the download or the money.",4
1250,"I love the concept of this activity. Students are drawn into learning about DNA by having something fun that they can relate to, such as ""Spongebob Squarepants"".Technical Remarks:It would have been helpful if there was a teacher's guide, answer key, or even a set of key definitions for DNA terms.",4
1251,"A good demonstration, with beautiful graphics.  There just isn't much to do here.",3
1252,"This module has a significant advantage over the typical textbook, where the instructions about what to do are separated from the relevant SPSS screen shots, if there are any. It does require that the student actually read and follow the instructions given in Pp slides that hover above the SPSS window that the student has opened. A useful, but more complex addition, might be to embed in the Pp slides some video playback consisting of screen captures with narration. This would greatly increase the size of the Pp slides, but my students, if not most students today, like to be shown how to do things, rather than reading about it.Technical Remarks:I did not load the special software to see if it would keep the Pp slide show hovering above the SPSS screen while working in that screen. The Pp slides showing the different survey responses that were used in the date entry process had circles drawn around different responses, as in a real survey. However, these circles were not properly aligned over the possible responses on survey show in the Pp slide.",4
1253,"This tutorial covers commonly-used SQL commands in three sections: 1. SQL commands; 2. Table Manipulation; and 3. SQL Syntax.  Each basic SQL command is well explained with an example.  Most of the examples use the same table named Store_Information, which makes the learning process easier.  It is an excellent learning tool and reference material for beginners.Technical Remarks: The material is easy to use.  Students can choose one of the three sections by a click, and can easily find a topic under a section.",5
1253,The structure and text associated with this tutorial is easy to read and follow.  The basic concepts of SQL syntax are well covered with several examples that are easy to follow and contain the source code.  Used as a supplement to a larger course teaching SQL this tutorial will enhance the experience and provide a resource to the user.  Links to specific topics are provided to the left and remain visible as the user switches from one topic to another.,4
1254,"Well done Jenny, coming from someone who is dyslexic with numbers. I like the way you structured the content in very clear and concise manner. The flow in  which numeracy was presented was not overwhelming.Technical Remarks:easy to navigate and visually appealing. This  presentation was well layed out and the flow was consistent. The slides had all their functional requirements.",4
1254,Very nice Jenny! I think this would be perfect in a middle school classroom as a way of practice.  I liked the way you set up your slides as it was very easy to navigate.  Technical Remarks:I did not find any technical issues with your presentation. All your buttons worked and I thought the navigation was easy to use and perfect for middle school,4
1255,This is a great introduction to students who are just starting to use computers. It really shows all the pieces that are important as well as what is safe to share on a computer. I like how there is an otpion for the words to be read to the students as many of the students may be too young to read the words on the screen.Technical Remarks:It would be useful to provide a follow up lesson for students on how to turn the computer on and access specific programs.,4
1255,"This is a wonderful Stand Alone Instruction Resourse for students grades 2 and higher. It has clear directions and is easy to navigate. It also provides audio for each slide as well as appropriate images. This StAIR has great direction and encouragement if a user chooses a wrong answer. Students must deduce answers from rules as well as apply rules to examples. Overall it teaches students about technology, computers, and online safety in a fun and simple way. Technical Remarks:None.",5
1256,"This presentation was very well done with great graphics and an easy flow which will engage students.  The review redirect for missed answers is a good reinforcement of concepts. The graphics were especially effective in providing a visual of the definitions and well thought out. For example, the community slides show affection among different species reinforcing the definition for visual leaners.  The audience was clearly targeted with content that matched the intent of the tutorial. My sixth grade son completed the activity and he liked the blend of zoology and ecology and special effects.Technical Remarks:The last slide when clicked goes back to the beginning of the quiz. I wonder if adding a badge or reward slide to end might help signal the end of the activity.",4
1256,"This was a great quiz about ecosystems.  The pictures were phenomenal and they made the show a joy to watch.  Each question provided immediate feedback, so students would know whether or not they had understood the information presented.  Students who are not strong readers may need additional guidance from the teacher.  Another option may be to embed additional resources such as audio files or videos from YouTube or TeacherTube.Technical Remarks:When I clicked after finishing the quiz, I was popped back to a slide as though I had incorrectly answered a question.  At first I thought the show continued, but then I realized I was somewhere in the middle.  Perhaps it was a glitch with my computer?",4
1256,"I thought this was a great quiz!  (I could be biased because I'm a science teacher!)  It was very interactive, and could be used in a group setting or individually to review and/or vocab terms.  It could also be posted on a website for students to access when they're not in school.  You might be able to add some little videos into the presentation if they got a term wrong to help clarify, or maybe add a voiceover to read the different definitions for students whose reading skills aren't as strong or who are auditory learners.  I definitely thought it did a great job with including UDL because it showed how new information could be presented to students, how students could interact with the information, and could hopefully motivate students to learn more about the different habitats and ecosystems around them.Technical Remarks:During the presentation, I had a few problems with the slides advancing too quickly and jumping around, but that could be a problem with Keynote, which was the application where I opened it.",4
1257,"I like how this StAIR incorporates the UDL princple of text to speech allowing students to listen to the slide when they click on the speaker (although I was having a hard time with this).  This is important for lower elementary students since they are at varying reading levels.  The flow of the learning and strategies are great.  Students first get a review of coins, then practice identifying coins, then use their knowledge to add coins together.  The helpful hints were great when students answered incorrectly.  It was just enough of a hint to keep frustration down, but still allowed students to add the values together. This StAIR was very easy to use. I would use it in my own classroom.",5
1257,"I would use this lesson in my classroom.  I like the way the slides are organized, colorful, and easy to follow.  The use of lots of visuals is very helpful for students who learn best this way.   One thing that was a little tricky for me was the way the pictures of the nickels, dimes, and quarters were basically the same size on my screen.  Other than that, this is a great resource for teaching about money.  The opportunities for practice that are included in this lesson will definitely help to reinforce these concepts for students.",4
1257,Excellent job!!! This is a great resource for teachers on $.,5
1258,"This resource is engaging and useful. It is well-scaffolded, building on the learners knowledge and taking them through the different types of resumes in an understandable way. There are quizzes at the end of the resource which get progressively harder so learners can continue though their understanding of how to use resumes through the quizzes.In short, I would strongly recommend this resource to introduce the different structures and uses of resumes.  It could easily be used by high school, college, or intermediate and above level ESL students.Technical Remarks:It is very colorful (which I love!) and includes audio for those who love sounds. For example, there’s a bell that rings for right answers ☺ but no sound for wrong answers ☹. The only thing to be careful of is that the first button is a little hard to click, but after that, it’s very easy to use with simple “back” and “next” buttons. You even get a chance to review before the quizzes if, like me, you forget details easily. My only complaint is that I would have liked to see examples of the resumes or links to sample resumes. Otherwise, it’s great!",5
1259,"Found the value of this site focused on entrepreneurial topics from truly successful entrepreneurs.  The video feed was excellent, the Bill Gross, this is the type of supplemental materials that help the learner to grasp knowledge from additional sources.  Having the e-corner will prove to be invaluable to my university.

In retail, sales associates work very hard in achieving store goals, and when the goals are met, and the store is ranked number one in sales or customer experience, sales associatese aren't the ones being recognized from corporate with bonuses or extra time off.Another thing that was interesting was the initial high motovation of employees at the beginning, excited to do their work, but over time, employees lose their motivation due to the lack of recognition. Which means employees need to be reminded of how important their work is for the company, and how much they are valued at the company. Verbal affirmation, providing lunch, setting personal goals are some ways to keep employees motivated.Technical Remarks:Everything was crystal clear!!",3
1278,I found the point about the students that were “cold callers” very intriguing. Trying to raise money for a school is a difficult task especially when in a recession. They are calling alumni and other who had received help or attend the school in the past. These callers are not always welcomed by the individual on the other end of the phone. As a caller they may feel that they are making little to zero progress in acquiring money for the school due to the high failure rate. They need to see how well they are doing as a total to show that they actually are making a difference in the task at hand. This job is high in task significance and the caller should have the opportunity to see what effect they are making. Another similar story was the job of a Lifeguard. Many will never have to jump into a pool and have to save a life. Adams had a great idea to use stories from the media about how a lifeguard had saved a drowning victim to motivate other lifeguards.,4
1278,"I definitely agree and support Adam's three recommendations to boost up employees' motivation, commitment and satisfaction to their jobs and the missions of the companies they work for. The mission of my organization, an organ transplant organization (OPO) and the work I do everyday, although not directly related to saving people's lives, motivate me to give 120% of myself for the cause.   Once in awhile, I heard stories of people we helped saved or prolonged their lives.   The feeling of satisfaction and appreciation of being  a part of the organization is indescrible.  ",4
1278,Adam Grant makes an interesting point that reminding people of the meaning and significance of their work can double their productivity. And he did this by simply sharing stories from people who benefited from their jobs,3
1278,"I think Adam made a great point in his research. It would help companies lower the turnaround rate of employees in companies if employees heard or saw their job really does make a difference. I have worked in retail for almost 7 years, which is very tedious. If someone showed me appreciation it would definitely keep me motivated to work harder. I wish the question was brought up why companies do not use this technique in trainings more often. I also wanted to know more about similar motivating techniques employers could use if they could not use Adam's way of motivating.",4
1278,"Understanding the significace of the invisible workers really do help make a difference. Those workers who want to make a difference in a customers point of view increases profit. When the Volvo workers were introduced to the stories of people in volvo recks, it was interesting to hear how that increased task sifnificance of employee motivation. Good interview.",4
1278,"After hearing Task Signigicance by Mark Adam made me realize that I didn't notice some of the invisible jobs that are task significance. I think it is really important for invisible jobs (task significance) to be notice. Not only because people would notice what they do can impact and benefit of what they do, but people would be more happy and it would motivate them to work better and this is how the world would be better if there are more people encourage to benefit and help other people.",4
1278,"I really thoght it was cool that Adam Grant found jobs that really made a difference, but thes people never saw the outcome of their work. He did this so they could see the outcome their work did and the difference they we're making!Technical Remarks:This allowed employees to be more motivated and to do their job more efficiently.",4
1279,"I really like the concept of the IRS tutorials but I found a couple of problems with this tutorial:

1. Tax Deduction vs. Tax Credit 	 
The second box comparing credits and deductions with credits seems to have an erroneous label.

It says: ""Without Deduction Without Credit""

Amount of tax $1,470 	 


Comment: It seems the right-hand column should be labeled With Deduction, Without Credit.

2. Also, here is some language from the tutorial:

The following expenses are not allowed: 
 services of a gardener or chauffeur 
 schooling for a child in the first grade or above 
 schooling for a child below first grade unless the cost is incidental to the schooling, and cannot be separate from total cost 
 overnight camp

Here is language from Publication 503:

Education.   Expenses for a child in nursery school, pre-school, or similar programs for children below the level of kindergarten are expenses for care.

Comment: It appears that the second from last bullet in the tutorial is more restrictive than the publication.
Perhaps the last bullet is meant to describe meals and other services that are incidental to schooling.
Furthermore, the sentence itself seems circular: Schooling below the first grade is not allowed unless it is incidental to the schooling?",2

1289,"I spent 25 minutes reading the biography on Thales.  I made sure to read and understand what all he has done.  Since I didn't know of him I took the time to read up on him and his work on mathematics.  This site was about a man who is said to have some influence on mathematics, mainly in geometry.  Because of the time he was living in, there isn't much work or writings he did on display.  This time period many men have claimed to do have idea's but no real proof.  I did find it interesting that some famous mathematicians did acknowledge his idea's so he was a starting factor to mathematics.  I think the site used the information that it had and did show that Thales was a well respected mathematician.  He did bring Geometry to the Greeks and is said to be one of the first Philosophers before Socrates.  With the lack of information on Thales, the site did bring good examples of his work.  I think this could only be used to a biography of Thales life and not necessarly for teaching of him and his work.  Because there isn't a lot of documentation it is hard to follow his work.  But they did talk about his geometry and his way of measuring pyraminds and shadows.  They also talked of his ideas of the world, how Earth was flat and was on water.  Although his ideas are well dated, he did have the knowledge to explain things and give reasons why things happen.  I think this site was very easy to use,  although like I said before, it is good for a history update on Thales, but to learn exactly what he did is a little tougher.  Although there wasn't a lot from him written down, he was praised as a fine mathematician.",3
1289,its really great that theres plenty of biography about mathematician and their works.  it is very informative and interesting to read for those who like math and history.,3
1289,"a) I spent about 25-35 minutes using this website. It's not particularly large, but it is chock full of information about Thales, who is a mathmetician I'm interested in doing a report about for my own class, which is why I chose those link to look at. I mainly just read through all the different information, and I bookmarked to it so I could keep track of her sources and use the other links on the page.

b) Certainly it does present the information well. One can read her paper, see the links to other sites and basically learn all there is to know about Thales, who is educationally significant himself both mathematically and historically.

c) I don't think that this website is particularly better than any others I've seen about mathemeticians. It's good information, but for the most part, as a learning or teaching tool, is only average. 

d) The material itself is easy to use, but could be better organized. Say a student just wanted some basic facts about Thales - this site would be a poor place to look for them because you have to sift through long pieces of text to get to them. However, it's still a good site, just a bit unorganized.",3
1289,"I spent about 40 minutes reading about Thales of Miletus. This site describes about the biography of a famous Mathematician and Scientist, Thales. Even though he did so many interesting things during his time  like calculating a ship out at sea and measuring the pyramids by their shadow but still he is believed to be not as smart as some people thought. He was always questioned with his discoveries and his explanations on the eclipse were viewed by some as a lucky guess. There was not a lot of evidence supporting certain findings that he supposedly discovered. I think this is a very interesting and unusual to know. The material in this site is very significant for educational purposes. And I also believe that knowing about these Mathematicians who had some part in the Mathematical world should be credited by knowing their biographies and their inventions.

1308,A great open text for teaching information literacy and reseach skills. Some of the authors are librarians. ,5
1308,Thanks for sharing this information on Merlot. ,5
1309,"Overview 
This is a high-quality text useful in teaching information literacy to undergraduates. The Seven Pillars Model generally matches the competency standards for information literacy developed by the ACRL.
After outlining what students should be able to understand and do, the text provides a scenario for each pillar. Each chapter also contains useful exercises that engage students in actually doing elements of the information literacy pillars. 
There are a number of good models that can be discussed and used in class, including models of Boolean Logic (p. 21-23), information source depth (p. 17), and citation formats (p. 56-58). There are also links to online quizzes for select chapters, and printable exercises.
This text is one of the more up-to-date of the information literacy texts available, and stresses the importance of a general awareness of new information coming out continuously. The text is full of links to important websites, although one could see the need for these links to be updated as they change. The text also explains the use of social media as an information format (p. 50), as well as the unique concerns of evaluating this type of information (p. 66). The text also includes up-to-date information on software for citation management (p. 84).
Select Chapter-Specific Observations
The chapter on gathering information includes an important element missing from most information literacy texts—sharing information. Although only one paragraph was devoted to this issue (p. 59), it can serve as a good discussion starter for what information sharing looks like in an educational environment that promotes individuality and isolation in the creation of information.
The chapter on evaluation of materials includes an important section on knowing when to stop, which identifies and helps instructors engage in conversations with students about the emotional stresses that accompany information literacy and tips for not becoming overwhelmed (p. 71-72).
The chapter on presentation is refreshing in how it treats students as co-creators of information--even in writing scholarly articles (p. 95)--which takes students from viewing information literacy as merely a means of accomplishing homework to a means of creating information that can be useful to others. This should engage students more in the issues of information literacies, as they see a larger and lasting benefit. 
Considerations
1. Some of the sub-sections could be placed within other chapters, and different pillars are sometimes hard to differentiate. For instance, in visual literacy, the plan pillar mentions the need to know “where to look for various types of visual materials” (p. 106). However, it is not entirely clear how this is different from the scope pillar—“being aware of what information is available” (p. 105). They cover similar topics.
2. The scenarios are generally helpful; however, at times the scenario’s link to the pillar is confusing. For example, the gather scenario seems like it would be equally applicable to a plan scenario. It would be easier to understand if each scenario was more purposeful and direct in highlighting the specific elements that each pillar calls for.
Conclusion
Although there are some issues to be aware of, they are not significant enough to diminish my high recommendation for this text as the primary text for undergraduate instruction in information literacy. As an instructor of undergraduate information literacy, the comprehensiveness of the information literacy topics, the practical exercises and scenarios, the helpful models and worksheets, and the up-to-date nature of the text make it easy to recommend.",5

It also has a special section called ""Ask Dr. Math."" It shows hundreds of pages of math questions by other people, and you are even given the chance to ask questions yourself. They well verify, give you examples, and help you understand whatever topic in math you need. There is another section for problems and puzzles, where students or teachers can sign up to do them. They also provide problems and puzzles of the week, which I thought was cool. There is a blog formatted page where teachers can communicate with other teachers, as well as a discussion group.  They offer many math resources and books too. This website is especially good for students looking to better their math skills, or have questions answered. It's a good idea that teachers are involved with the program as well. I am definitely going to return and use this site for future resources and projects.

Technical Remarks: this was a very understandable website and it was very easy for every one to understand even for the computer illiterate.,4
1324,A very informative and well-written resource addressing a very timely subject. Technical Remarks: Easy to use. This online hypertext book can be downloaded.,5
1325,Very interesting applet that runs well.  Accompanying references should make for a neat student project.,5
1326,appears to require a login that is not provided,2
1327,Excellent 'marketplace' for links to relevant cases; good regulatory framework by month comparing the Roe and Casey decisions; good photos of actual persons involved in cases; Justice by justice breakdown on some cases; good expansion of privacy interests in the relevant amendments.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate.,5
1328,"The Russian Abacus is diffently a useful tool.  I spent time working on the applet and teaching myself how it is used and its purpose.  I tried to figure out how the counting method was developed and that became obvious once I started moving the beads from side to side.  At the bottom of the Applet their is a digital gauge that computes the counting for you which helps  to determine that each row of beads represent a distinct counting system.  It starts out at the top at ten million and goes down to the bottom row which represents fractions starting from 1/4 on up to 1.  I spent about 45 minutes surfing through the site as well as counting with the applet.You just need to be careful not to end up on a different subject.  This happened often. I felt that the site could have given a bit more history on the Abacus and also given some instuction and examples on the usage and capabilities for those who may not have the time to figure it our for themselves.  I also believe this could be a great teaching tool for young children learning to count; it is not only visual it's hands on as well and that may work better for those students who are visual and learn better with hands-on type projects.Overall its easy to use, but the site needs more information on the subject.  ",2
1328,"I was here for a little while. This material looked really detailed but there was just so much that I got lost. The pictures were nice and surved as a balance to all of the info. It was easy to use but just a little to much after awhile. However, looking past that, there is more then enough material to help anyone find anything that they could need on this topic. ",3
1329,"This is a quick, fun way to learn some of the most distinctive (and some of the most common) ECG/EKG rhythms. I've used it in multiple courses, especially in my paramedic program, and it's a good starter set of rhythm strips for practice.",5
1329,"This free online ECG simulator offers visual learning with 6 second ECG strips for numerous heart rhythms, both normal and abnormal. The simulator offers information regarding each rhythm as well as an ECG strip to visually depict the rhythm. The user may also choose a learning or game mode to expand or test their knowledge. This site is useful for any nursing students who want to become more familiar with heart rhythms and reading ECGs.",4

1330,I like the applet where ykou can create your own shape of sound wave.,4
1330,Beautifully executed aesthetically and includes a number of very nice interactive java applets.Technical Remarks: I couldn't seem to make the sound work properly on my Mac G4 under IE 5.0.,4
1331,"This applet has proved very useful in my Remote Sensing of the Environment course, where student understanding of the reflectance spectra of different objects is basic to the course.",4
1331,"A neat approach to a common applet.  Works well, and I think students will appreciate itssimplcity.   However, many graphics tools containa similar utility.  Also, users should be aware that color is a biological phenomenon, and relating it too closely to frequency can lead to misconceptions.",3
1332,i browsed through this web site for about 10 minutes.  it is very helpful on giving good guidlines on interviews.  it is very helpful and it is very easy to follow.Technical Remarks: This is a great web site!  It is very informative and really gives you step-by-step information.  ,3
1333,"I have linked to this page for two semesters and had my English Lit II Survey students use it in their reading of (and writing on) Tennyson.While the audio files are nice, the recording of Tennyson reading is also available on the cd which comes with my students' textbook.The poems are also all available at other sites (specifically the Victorian Web--another Merlot site), as are the photos of Tennyson and his wife.The remarks under Style are interesting, but some more remarks focussing specifically on Tennyson's poetry and style would be more apropos.Students have found the hyperlinks in ""Lucretius"" useful and have wondered why there aren't similar links in other poems.  Technical Remarks: Students find it easy to access all materials on the page (though again, most are available elsewhere), but the link to one poem (""The Progress of Spring"") is, alas, dead, as is that to the text version of ""The Passing of Arthur"".The page was created in 1995; has the author updated it since?",2
1333,"A good site for general overview of Tennyson and his works. Fun to have the different media selections as well.Technical Remarks: A bit dark, which makes it hard to read at times. But all the links worked, so hey...",4
1334,"Interesting information.  However, there was heavy emphasis on the social problems of the era, but minimal information on the actual fire, and the steps taken to improve fire safety in multi-story buildings after the fire occurred.",3
1335,"This is a well written and compiled article dealing with computers.  It covers articles that deal with psychological, physical and educational issues regarding computers.  Most of the related material is dated in the mid 90's with a few pieces written in 2000, 2001 and 2002.",4
1336,"This applet can be used to demonstrate some of the properties of vector cross product. Given two vectors  a, b in the same plane, the cross product vector c = a x b is produced.  One can drag the vectors by their tip to change them. This Applet would be an excellent classroom demo tool (for example in a Calculus course) for introducing the cross product of vectors. ",4
1336,"Works smooth, with good graphics.  Limited by the fact that the two vectors are always shown lying in the same plane.",4
1337,"This is a great tool that allows students to validate their web documents for conformance to W3C standards.

Documents can be tested by uploaded them, providing a URL to the document, or through direct markup input.

I use this tool in all of my Web Development courses.",4
1339,An especially useful resource- profiles of business owners who pursued entrepreneurship while a student- in exposing students to the challenges (and rewards) of balancing the demands of launching a start-up alongside other academic objectives. I intend to draw on these materials in discussions with my hospitality entrepreneurship and innovation (ENTI) students on why they should pursue winning business ideas beyond the ENTI course.,4
1340,"Would be a good study tool to reinforce student learning in the basics of S/D and AS/AD shifts. The interactive graphs must be shifted by the student, and then feedback is immediately given indicating whether the chosen shift was correct.",4
1340,"I spent 20 minutes browsing the materials.  I found the text to be easy to read and clear and the Flash animations to be excellent.  With minimal fuss, I was able to manipulate the diagrams by pulling the curves and clicking on 'items' like prices and quantities in response to the problems posed.  I agree with the author that the interactivity adds to the learners interest and understanding.  Because it is all done over the web, any Internet user with an up-to-date Macromedia Flash add-in should have no difficulty using this site.Technical Remarks:Perhaps in the Introduction, the author should give users the opportunity to download/update Macromedia Flash and list the technical requirements.  ",5
1341,"I found this site very interesting. I intended to spend a few minutes browsing through the site, and instead, ended up staying for over an hour. I ultimately visited every link on the site. The quality of the content is very high. I found the tiling patterns to be very interesting and appreciated the historical references. Also, I have never been exposed to the crystallographic notations before and was very interested in understanding them further. (I will be interested to learn more about the Alhambra in Grenada, and how the Moorish tilings represent 13 of the the 17 planes.) I believe this site would be a valuable tool for learning, in that it is historically representative, mathematically accurate, and visually interesting. I found the site very easy to navigate, but would appreciate a larger menu bar a the top.<",5
1342,"Toondoo.com is great website that allows students to create and share their own comic strips. Students will find this fun and enjoyable no matter the subject. Sixth graders will love this because it will allow them to put the content they learn from punctuation into their own perspective. This website allows students to explore the creativity and it’s simple. If the students are provided with the topic, they can utilize this website to its full potential. Teachers will find this beneficial because it is fun for the students, and the teacher can see what the students have retrieved from their mindset.",4
1343,"I have really enjoyed working through this vast resource and even learned some things today!  The links are easy to use, the graphics are colorful and crips, the explanations clear.   The activities are varied and address several methods of learning.  Feedback is provided during multiple choice answers to facilitate learning if a correct or wrong choice is made (RSI).  Fabulous!  I will spend more time on this site.Technical Remarks:Not all links provide information. Most disappointing was the interpretation link when working in some of the app features, for example calculating body mass index.  This seemed to be consistent on several pages.  There are a few other links that when clicked on did not add content.  ",5
1344,"As I was scrolling through sites, Traffic Jam caught my attention. First I just dove into moving the pieces, trying to figure out what I was exactly suppose to do. Then I finally found,  and read the directions, which were under 3 different names, (that was annoying), reset the game and stared again. On the first level,(easy), it took me only three tries to complete the fewest amount of steps. The second level, (medium), I did eleven attempts to try and complete the game. I was not successful in doing so because, I was not able to compose a stronger strategy, and I was starting to became quite frustrated. [My best score out of the 11 was on the 10th try, with 17 steps.] By  the third level (hard), I was already too frustrated and only gave it two shots, then I stopped.  

I think it's a pretty fun and titillating game for students to warm up with before diving into a big lesson for a class.  It get's the wheels in your head rolling before hand. This shows you have to stretch your mind, as well as, open  your eyes to come up with different strategies to figure out a correct pattern in the fewest amount of steps; which there is more than one way to do so.Technical Remarks:Should not have to search for the directions. Would have like to see them directly on the first page. 

Liked that you had a choice of different colors for the game. 

Software, was very easy to use.
(The user just has to click on one of the inner images they want to move.)",3
1344,"I gave it a try for about 15 minutes, and wasn't able to cut my score on any of the various levels. I may have missed the point intended by the creator, and enjoyed myself in what reminded me of a checkers game jumping the other pedestrians. But after not being able to come up with a better strategy, I began to become a little frustrated. I wasn't sure if I had mastered the game, or was unable to see the error in my ways, and there was room for improvement. Good fun for a brief time. May be best suited for pre teen children, and then used as an intro to another lesson plan.",3
1344,"The Traffic Jam I found to be fun and challenging.  I spent about 20 minutes playing with this one and clicked around to try the different levels.  The easy level I could not do less than ten counts.  The other levels took me much more time to complete.	Even though this area was fun I did not find it very educational.  However, it did make my brain work trying to find the easy was to do the traffic jam.	I think the student and faculty would just find this as a game it would maybe be a good game to get a brain going before the educational area needs to start.	For this area the software was very easy to use and understand. ",4
1344,"1. I spent the first 10-15 min. on the first page just trying to figuer the thing out. When I knew it was a puzzle and it looked like you needed to arrange the pieces, I did so, in no particular order.Then I went to find the explaination for the game, or the mathematical principals behind it (which I never found).2. I think the game was trying to teach students about how to see patterns, but I felt like if you don't explain the math behind the game, I myself can't see the pattern.Its like when I draw, I know there's some deep mathmatics behind my ability to see a form and be able to re-create it again on paper by remembering its angles and its symetry, but if the math in my art was never explained to me, I probably would have never noticed it.3. I think it can enhance skills of seeing patterns, if there was better explaination in the system of how to arrange the people. but i think the site didn't do a good job in explaining, only a good job in asking questions.4. It was very easy to use the game, the directions were very effective and straight forward.",3
1344,"I spent thirty- minutes playing this game and it was very stimulating.  The material is intersting and fresh.  This could definitely enhance one's learning.  First time users may experience slight diffulty in regards to conncting to the game, other than that users should have no problems.",4
1344,"Playing this game was fun, I spent time trying to use the different levels of the game. The content of this site is good providing that you have gone to a different site that explains the math behind it. Then you come to this site to test your skills at sloving the problem. Getting to the site and useing it was no problem.",3
1345,Simple illustration of the process of transcription. Removes all complicating factors and helps students understand the basic concept.,4
1346,"This site was very good. However, it could have been a little bit more detailed.Technical Remarks:There are no technical requirements for this site.",5
1347,"I think that this material is improperly place in the business section of Merlot, rather it might be more useful in the occupational health and saftey discipline or the industrial hygene discipline.",3
1348,"This textbook is very much usable for any beginning Trigonmetry course. http://mecmath.net/trig/index.html I had to supplement the exercise set a bit in a number of sections. Also, I was able to supplement with topics found in the Stitz and Zeager Trigonometry textbook: http://www.stitz-zeager.com/  Also, students found the videos found here to be useful: http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/trigonometry.php",4
1349,"Loved the graphics.  Very instructional.  I would suggest adding a comment such as ""visit your favorite databases HELP page to determine which truncation symbol is used"".",4
1350,"It shows very clearly the relation between an earthquake occuring in the seafloor and the consequent tsunami-wave.
It doesn't show anything about how the tsunami evolve afterward in relation with the depth and how it bounce when it strikes the coasts",3
1350,I like the view of this animation.  At first you see the crossection of the fault and then see the bird's eye view of how the wave moves out from the epicenter.,5
1351,This was a nice exercise to determine if students have comprehended the basics of business organizational types. It was easy to use.  I gave it a three because it was so limited in the information that was presented. It would be nice to see this developed more so there is more depth to it.,3
1351,This was a good exercise but it wasn't as exciting as it might be.,3
1351,"Good flash exercise, but as other reviewers have mentioned requires prior knowledge without a link to source materisal",2
1351,"I liked the graphics and interactivity, but it does not teach the student the differences between the three types of business organizations; it just asked them to name them and shows some percentages about the three types. The ads on the site also were distracting for a learning environment.",3
1351,Seems to require prior introduction or experience with the material.  Does not describe the different types of business organizations.  Possibly too basic for collegiate level courses.,2
1351,"Quiz gives a good start, but not enough questions to adopt for a class; assumes a base of knowledge that might be better served with a brief mini-lecture (2-3 minutes) before

1351,"This is a nice exercise for students to get an introduction to the forms of business ownership.  It is interactive, and through statistics provides them with insights on why most successful firms move to the corporate form of ownership over time.  It is accurate and significant, and yet relatively simple.Technical Remarks: I found it easy to use, but I have the flash plug-in loaded on my computer.  One of the things that impressed me was the fact that if you didn't, a link was provided where you could download it easily prior to use.",4
1352,Some very good questions to ask people/clients looking to start their own business! The report includes links to recommended free online courses to gain more knowledge on the person's development areas.,4
1353,"Doctors Winter, Richardson, and Matsen do a terrific job presenting Shoulder Ultrasound.  I think this is a wonderful resource for ultrasound students and practicing sonographers to learn about shoulder ultrasound.  Being that this is not a skill that is usually covered in a general ultrasound curriculum, this topic is usually acquired in the field.  This presentation is excellent in that it discusses the reasons for shoulder ultrasound as well as portraying the pertinent anatomy not only with schematic drawings, but corresponding human models that are labelled, and corresponding ultrasound images.  It then discusses the views and techniques used to acquire the necessary images for diagnosis.  It also discusses pathologies that can be seen.  I would definitely guide my students here if they were interested in learning about some musculoskeletal ultrasound, specifically the shoulder site.",4

1354,"1. 45 minutes reviewing material.2. Content quality is quite good, extensive and in-depth.3. This is useful information and adds greatly to both learning and teaching.4. The difficulty of the material ranges from simple to technical.Technical Remarks: The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is now the standard notation for software architecture. It was developed jointly by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and Jim Rumbaugh at Rational Software Corporation (with help from others). Based on the use of the Rambough, Booch and Jacobson's methods (all processes and languages for designing complex software systems), the UML is the evolution of these and other approaches to business process, object, and component modeling. The UML provides the application modeling language for: (1) Business process modeling with use cases. (2) Class and object modeling. (3) Component modeling. (4) Distribution and deployment modeling.",5
1355,"Amazing! I love that the students can interact and get feedback from this PowerPoint. They can work at their own pace and review concepts even through online resources or supplemental questions/explanations. This is a great resource for your students. Thanks so much for sharing! The only thing that I would change would be the timing of the animations; the letters don't seem to be appearing quickly enough. Though, I am not an elementary teacher and am not sure if this is a strategy to ensure that the students read each sentence completely before moving on; if it is, then it works! ",5
1355,"I really liked your presentation.  I especially enjoyed the fact that if a student is still confused, they are linked straight to a video to explain it a different way.  Fantastic!  Technical Remarks:Great.  The only thing that I would suggest is to speed up the animations a little.  Big deal though. . . it gets the point across just fine .  ",5
1355,"The StAIR is very easy to follow and the flow is great.  Working with the different scenarios gives students an opportunity to check their skills. Each of the steps were well broken down and provided a good depth of information. I believe the instructional strategies for the reviews and practices will allow the students to better understand this project. Sometimes the flow of the document was interrupted by the I accidentally clicked on the page away from the button which forward the page. I don’t know how to fix this, but it would be an improvement to only let the links move the pages. Your use of color, fonts, and animation helped to meet UDL guidelines.  I can only suggest one more improvement because this project is amazing, but that would be to add an option to use text to speck for the student that needs help reading.  Otherwise awesome job. I spent about 15 minutes viewing this project and have to say it was very informative.Technical Remarks:Nice use of technology.  Animation, buttons, excellent",5

1360,"Great site for identifying consumers in your target area.  Students enjoyed looking up their own zip codes and reading about the different groups identified with each.  Modified the assignment slightly for higher education, but overall, very worthwhile exercise.Technical Remarks:Some of the site is not accessible without payment but students can still do market research from the limited site.",4
1361,"The purpose and subject of this project was well formed and clear throughout the presentation. I found it very appealing as the screen captures added visuals to accompany the walk through steps. I would add some more navigation buttons to be able to return to the beginning of the presentation, or some back buttons to go back a section. By including audio and visual elements, the lesson could be used for a variety of students with different learning styles. With the feedback provided in the review questions, the learners are able to assess their knowledge of the content.Technical Remarks:The lesson could use some additional navigation buttons.",4

1368,This is a great site. It shows a great deal of information regarding the causes and effects of global warming. It is great for high school or mddle school students.Technical Remarks:The animations give a lot of insight into the topic. A first time user may have some problems using this sight but with a little guidance it should be very easy to understand.,4
1369,I like the videos for the experiments.  Often times chemistry books will show you pictures of what happens but this lets you see the action as it takes place.  This is crucial for reactions that have more than one phase to them and you can see how they progress.,4

1387,"Kyle, your interactive powerpoint is very straight forward.  Learning the Mole is a hard concept for students to learn and I believe that you did a wonderful job walking them through the process.  Your presentation was neat, organized and contained a lot of information.  One thing that I think would be helpful would be sound and a visual aid.  I think that a video or demonstration on ""Moles"" would give students a different media to learn from.  I think that this powerpoint is effective for ""some"" learners.  In order to creat the maximum amount of optimal learning experiences, I think that you would want to include differnt forums of presentation.I think from a technical stand point....it flowed well and was organized.  I think students now like creativity and engagement.  I think that might be a great focus for the next time you revisit this assignment.Thanks for sharing.",4
1387,"Your presentation included a lot of great information about moles. I did not know what one was before seeing this. The quizzes offer a great way for the students to check their learning. Seeing examples of the problems is a great way for the students to learn how to do the conversion.  I am assuming there is some prior knowledge involved with the terms. Overall, the presentation does a great job of teaching the concept, reviewing the information with quizzes, and building to the end. Very good use of scaffolding.Technical Remarks:Adding some more sound to the presentation would liven it up for the students. Also, a video of someone doing the calcuation by hand would prove to be useful as well. Following the UDL guidelines, some type of audio support would be useful for students with vision impairments. For the last two questions, make all the multiple choice answers the same format, it will force the students to find the correct answer.",4
1387,"This presentation offers good examples of calculating moles in chemistry. I found the examples very helpful when attempting to calculate the mole quiz myself. The links to the periodic table was very useful. I also like how if you did not calculate the answer properly it took you back the example to show you how to properly calculate the correct answer. A suggestion to improve the StAIR is offer audio. I know for myself, especially in math, it helps me understand formulas if I hear it as I’m looking at the formula.",4
1388,"This is a good paper about the use of institutional repositories and OA peer-reviewed journals, and importance of faculty publishing its research to improve the visibility of the university.  It goes along with what MERLOT is trying to do.  Libraries have always been the keepers of research and librarians should promote OA.",4
1389,"This certainly is a new approach to drawing isomers. I do, however, believe it will only really be effective and comprehensive when used to draw alkanes, and alkanes only. Any form of substitution or the presence of multiple bonds will likely lead to confustion. The scope of organic chemistry is quie large and unsubstituted alkane chains are not usually a huge focus in most classes. It is, however, a fool-proof method to know how many carbons one has drawn. That being said, the student could always just count them as well.",3
1390,One of my favorite websites and it is bookmarked on every computer I use!,5
1391,"I attended a three-day seminar at the YIVO Institute, one of the focuses of which was the application of this Web site to the classroom. Although this site specifically deals with East European Jewish history and Yiddish culture, it could be used effectively in Western Civilization, advanced European, and other college courses, especially for courses that touch on the Holocaust or Eastern Europe. Among the site's many features are careful timelines, interactive maps(especially useful for tracking changes in East European political geography and the emigration of Jews to North America), as well as numerous photographs culled from YIVO's massive archives. One point our seminar addressed is that the Institute grants permission for fair-use photographic reproduction from the site, provided that credit is given to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. One of the site's most remarkable features, located in Places/Lublin, is a walk down Lubartovka Steet, which is not only interactive but provides translations of Yiddish and Polish signage. Audio files of Yiddish music and poetry are also included, as well as many translated documents.Technical Remarks:The site is user friendly, but some features are counterintuitive (be sure and click on the tiny icons in the upper lefthand corner for browsing). Teachers should immediately click on the ""For Teachers"" link, which provides an extensive, seven-part curriculum guide downloadable for free in PDF.",5
1392,"The video ""Out of Africa: African Missionaries to the Mississippi Delta"" is a compact and highly original telling of key themes in the history of contemporary Christianity, the growing importance of African Christianity and the growing interconnectedness of evangelicals.  I have recommended this video to my colleagues teaching modern Christian history in a distance format, as the film provides both a self-contained look at the subject and ample material for discussion.  It would also be useful in the classroom.",5
1392,"This resource could be a valuable tool for exploring a ""specific"" aspect of Mississippi history.  The site claims to include a 23 minute video which I never could find on the site.  One of the problems with this resource includes a limited bibliography that doesn't include some of the most well know and accepted works in this area.",4
1393,This lesson applies practical application of finance and clearly explains a complex topic. Great use of links to help explain and use interactive to gain understanding of topic. Requiring a short essay and research problem checks for understanding and provides a way to rubric lesson. Requiring skills necessary to complete task provides a way to determine students that need extra time to obtain calulator and web research skills. Perhaps providing a hand-out of steps for calucator use would help support students who struggle with multi-step directions.,4

1394,"This is a very important subject, and many people do not know about it. Those of us who do are concerned that there are few solutions. One way we can fight GMOs is through educating the population about what they are, and how they effect the environment and our health. Spread the word and the research! We can also try to grow more of our own foods, and buy organic... we have a long road ahead of us!",4

1394,"This website is great for understanding purposes about GMO foods. Personally, I find it difficult to stay away from GMO foods. I feel alot of food growers are converting to GMO. The only truely way to stay away from GMO foods is to grow the food yourself. A topic that was very highly discussed in my class.",4
1395,"I learned about this resource during a AAAS symposium on Science Education.  Jim Bower, a Caltech neurobiologist, has worked on improving science education through supporting teachers who use hands-on inquiry in the Pasadena schools for over seventeen years.  This web site is built upon the conviction that ALL children can learn good science if presented with engaging and developmentally appropriate challenges.Technical Remarks: Registration can be complicated.  Kids must secure parental permission.  I recommend that you first enter as a guest.  You can also follow the links to Numedeon, Inc to contact the authors to register as a teacher.",5
1396,This site is a great resource for bird photographs and audio clips for classroom use.,4
1397,This is a great lesson that incorporates the use of primary documents and anaylzing photographs.  The lesson is useful because it allows students to analyze photographs and then create a product from their understanding.  I also like that the lesson is structured for lower-level learners where the teacher can provide a fill-in letter form to help them develop their final product.  Great inclusion of UDL principles including visual and expressive learning. Technical Remarks:None,5
1397,This lesson was moving and gives students a personal look into history. Your UDL principles are clearly listed in your lesson plan by offering alternatives and/or additional support to students with those needs. Giving the students the ability to share their letters and reflect on the horrible past that the postcards depict will give students a sense of understanding of what actually occurred in terms of race relations and what that means for them today. I agree that the age level for this lesson should be no younger than 15. The accompanying Google Docs lesson plan offers many different activities that can help students understand the objectives you set for them.,5
1397,"This seems like a lesson that will elicit powerful emotional responses from students.  Although the site is rather disturbing, it gives history and talks about conditions that cannot be forgotten.  I can see how the lesson would draw students in and make them eager to give their opinions in the letters.  From a Universal Design for Learning perspective, it is good that you included graphic organizers and sample writing to help guide students in their thinking and what is expected of them.  Having the visual pictures available to support student learning also is important.  It will make their learning more memorable for this particular assignment.Technical Remarks:Thank you for including the link to the website.  I did not find any technical problems.",5
1398,"Like the rest of the sites in the author's collection, this site is very informative, clear, and uses nice graphics (some animated) to illustrate the points.  Very extensive discussion.  For a nontechnical discussion, this site should be very helpful.",5

Tutorial loaded extemely well using Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome browsers.   Quizzes and pop-ups add a nice level of interactivity, however the tutorial itself I found to be very lengthy in nature to be viewed in web browser.Suggestions:Create separate (mini-tutorials) for easier comprehension for students.Align (center) the content on the page and increase the font size for greater visibility.",3
1400,This site has an excellent collection of exercises and a workout generator. I have already contacted my partner to view the site and examine how we can use it.,5
1401,Very good information on viruses.,5
1402,thank you for good exercises Leaning.,5
1402,"I found this site really useful.  I looked up coin tossing under probibility and learned how tossing a coin is like tossing a two sided die,and the Bernolli Distribution, how the patterns of the toss can be somewhat predicted. For example, it is more likely that you would toss TTH (tails, tails, heads) before you toss THT. Under the ""history and terminolgy"" page, I learned about the following terms, end of proof(QED),a latin abbreviation that means ""that which has been demonstrated"". Another term I had never heard of was pairwise, it means taking all unordered 2 subsets of a given set. Another is star that is a term used in geometry. Porism, which means proportion and called theorm in mathmatical terms.There were others I knew but needed to review, like unknown and complex variables.  The examples of each term were pretty straightforward, and something an instructor could easily expand upon.Technical Remarks:By using the ""history and terminology page""  I could find the definition to many terms I didn't know or thought were interesting.  Sometimes after reading about foreign term/concept, I recognized other terms with in that concept that I was familiar with and saw how it was connected.  Then it was more applicable for me.  It was also a great page for expanding my mathematical vocabulary.  The more I learn about math the more confidence I will have, and the more I will want to learn. I think this page was a great tool for students and instuctors to use.  For students, it allows them to explore on their own, learn about concepts, write down some questions they may have and bring those to class.  For the instructor, it is a great way to see examples of how the concepts are being explained and the way the material is being presented. It could also be used as a great refresher course for instuctors.  There was alot of terminology and it is a great resource for both students and instructors.",4
1402,i liked this site because iam really into the probabilites of things because of statistics. i play baseball so probabilities are very interesting when it comes to statistics. unfortunatly this is a part of math that not too many people are interested in. i think one of the main reasons i like probabilites so much is because everything else is so confusing to me.,4
1403,"I was looking for a site that deals with English grammar.However, I suggest that this site have a spell check.  ""curriculum"" is a good word and should be spelled correctly.",2
1404,"At first the site looks very muddy and jumbled, as there are so many activities jammed onto the page.  However, the collection is organized well, and easy to navigate.  Teachers will find a wealth of classroom-ready and creative teaching materials built around common writing tasks and literary response.  There is also a nod to Common Core requirements with a robust section on writing about non-fiction materials.
The activities themselves are well thought-out, with a a draft->work->polish->publish theme.  The most important thing I found was the emphasis upon publication and sharing--enforcing the idea of audience and getting beyond writer-centered composition.  For example, in the poetry section, there is a safe way to share and publish kid-made poetry.  In the ""Amelia Earhart"" section, students produce a ""published"" news story based on their research of the topic.  Emphasis is in practical writing skills, but the audience is beyond the teacher and the classroom.  
I was impressed with the ease of use and the creative way in which the writing activities are put together. 
The reviewer highly recommends the ""Flashlight Readers"" section which provides writing and critical thinking activities built around nine popularly taught fictional works.  ",5

1406,"1) I spent 10 minutes reviewing the site. I plan on testing its use out in an on-line class format.2) The quality of the content was excellent. The author has engaged the issue from a diverse perspective. It might be helpful to provide some parameters from which to comment on each user perspective (ie. What specific issues (cost, utilization trends) would the insurance company have?3) Students' learning will be enhanced. Ethical arguments need to be address through a multifaceted lens.

This class has no regular class schedule or weekly readings. Almost everything is oriented around your team and your project, with only a few deadlines. Each team is responsible for analyzing a recent, ongoing, or anticipated initiative at a real company. Examples might be a strategic reorientation, organizational restructuring, introduction of a new technology, or worker participation program.

1415,"I enjoyed this StAIR and found it very appealing and useful in an elementary classroom. The quality of content is useful and very applicable for teaching a second or third grade student. Two digit subtraction is a mathematics concept that can be challenging for kids. This StAIR presented valid concepts, models, and skills. This StAIR is effective as a potential teaching-learning tool. The video that shows the students how to regroup with 2 digit subtraction was very enjoyable to watch. I plan on showing it to my own second grader. After the process of two digit subtraction is explained to the learner, then he or she gets to try some problems. If the student clicks on the wrong answer, they get feedback and a prompt such as “Did you accidently add instead of subtract?” The learner gets to retry the problem. If they get the answer correct they get applause and feedback on why it is correct. The presentation was effective for ease of use. The use of graphics and images were appropriate for the age of the intended audience and enjoyable to view. However, there were a couple of trouble spots. The video would not play, I had to view Erin’s copy of her StAIR, and on the initial previewing of this a few of the slides were incorrectly linked. However, this problem is fixable. I would strongly recommend this StAIR to others.",5
1415,The lesson is a 2 column subtraction review. The feedback is great; both visual and auditory.I couldn’t review the video presented through the Powerpoint. Adding a text field w/ the URL would make it so a user could go visit the video directly. There was a infinite loop in slide 9 and one of the incorrect answers addressed an answer which was different than the answer selected.The lesson offered several types of subtraction problems and described the methods for solving each time. This was good for reinforcing the concepts being learned.,4

1419,I really like the 3-D animations for transcription and translation. I think it will be very useful in the classroom to help students visualize the process of protein synthesis.,4
1420,I really enjoyed this site. I read through each of the sections and enjoyed what I had learned. the content was relevant by showing how 3-D drawings are used in architecture. An art student would use this type of material. It was simple to see the connection of math and art.,4
1420,This site was not a very educational or descriptive site. The site will show you the basics of drawing three dimensional objects. Basic marital with brief descriptions are easy to navigate and easy to use. Overall it is a informative site.,3
1420,This website is uncluttered and straightforward. I like that it breaks down the standard geometry needed to execute 3-D drawings.  Creating a drawing that looks convincing can be difficult and this site provides the most basic tools for teaching beginners how to visualize a structure in the simplest forms. I would like if the website visually applied the geometry to structure other then buildings.,3
1420,"The site was was fairly basic so it only took about half an hour to explore it as a whole. In my opinion, even though I found the material to be pretty basic it is still a very good educational resource for those who haven't dealt with geometry or drawing concepts. As far as enhancing the effectiveness of faculty teaching or student learning, it really depends on the level of education. I believe that it is a very good resource for elementary, junior high, and maybe high school students. However, I feel it is too basic to make a strong impact on college level learning.Technical Remarks:This website is very user friendly. As long as one knows how to follow links and read, they should be fine.",3
1420,I spent only half an hour on this site because the concept is very basic and its exploration was very sterile. The description I read was unfortunately very misleading. I suppose if you are not extremely well educated in the material shown on this page you may find it useful as a basic first step toward the process of drawing a three dimensional object. I think the potential educational value would be useful up to elementary level geometry. I found this site to be very easy to use and understand.,3

1432,"Reviewed: November 6, 2004Overall Rating: 	2.5Category Ratings: 	Content Quality : 2.5	Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching Tool : 2.0  	Ease of Use for Students and Faculty : 4.0  	Description  	Overview: 	For the intermediate and advanced student of French, this program allows students to hear and watch extracts of interviews with various Francophone personalities. No exercises are provided but students have the opportunity to watch clips of various people around the world from the political and artistic world.  	Learning Goal(s): 	The user of TV5: La francophonie en images will develop listening comprehension skills and a greater knowledge of different Francophone cultural and political figures. This will help students increase vocabulary in the target language and become more familiar with French culture and current events.  	Target Student Population(s): 	Students with intermediate and advanced proficiency in French.  	Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills: 	Students must have the appropriate level of French for listening comprehension of authentic video interviews.  	Type of Material: 	Audio and video material clips.  	Technical Requirements: 	A media player for audio and video; a new version may need to be downloaded.  	Evaluation and Observation 	  	Rating: 2.5 	Category: Content Quality   	 Strength(s):  	  	 The content is accurate and culturally relevant. Each video clip is identified so students know what to expect. 	Weaknesses: 	There are, however, no activities, either before,
 during or after associated with the video modules. The site would be improved if there were comprehension questions included or at pre-viewing activities.   	Rating: 2.0 	Category: Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching Tool   	  	Strength(s):  	  	  This site could be used as a supplement to study on Francophone culture.Weaknesses:	No activities associated with it; instructors would have to develop their own activities to accompany viewing.  	Rating: 4.0 	Category: Ease of Use for Both Students and Faculty   	Strength(s):  	  	  	It is easy to navigate through the site. Viewers can choose personalities by region or specialty. Once the cursor is on a particular photo, a short summary of the clip is shown. Technical Remarks: Moving around the site is fairly straightforward; however, I was asked to download additional software (Real Player 10.5). When I clicked on a photo of a personality, the video started right up but was in another window, and I was not directed there but rather had to find the new window. This can be confusing and lead to the notion that the site is not working properly.",3
1433,A good collection of materials concerning the death penalty. The last section dealing with steps you can take to end the death penalty fosters a personal opinion which I would not use in a political science class.Technical Remarks:Some of the links are broken.,4
1433,Nice presentation but many internal links are broken. Site needs to be updated (Mar 2011) or it will lead to more frustration than it might be worth.Other than that irritant the site is a nice compilation of data and arguments about the death penalty and should serve as a valuable resource for people interested in the topic.,3
1433,"I have used this site in both criminology and introductory sociology courses.  Students generally respond quite well to it.  It provides a clear but not overwhelming overview of a range of basic arguments against the death penalty and includes questions for further thought and links for further information.  Students regularly come away from reviewing this site remembering its key points and having changed views about the issue.  I usually only ask students to read the main site, but the wealth of information lends itself to a larger assignment involving deeper exploration as well.",5
1434,This is a good site that provide quick and easy information about the water potential equation and what it means.,4
1437,Good introduction to the FASB throught the use of the webpage.

1438,"1.  I examined Lesson Pro and ""tried it on for size"".  I found Lesson Pro to be quite comprehensive and user friendly.2.  Lesson Pro does accurately present concepts and models which are educationally significant.  Interestingly, this model is quite similar to a course management system which we use for our community college online students.  The idea that secondary school students have access to a similar learning environment is great!  By offering such a program for individual teacher development, helps teachers to ""go outside"" of the face to face classroom and enter the world of the internet.  The teacher would be able to reach a larger population and if used in an individual course, the teacher could reach his/her students---outside of the classroom.  In addition, exposing younger students to the internet will only promote earlier development of computer skills for future usage.3.  Student learning and faculty teaching will definitely be enhanced (as stated in number 2).  To expand on #2's answer, Lesson Pro can save ""classroom"" time for other things-group discussins/projects/presentations/etc.  Finally, once the teacher has ""set up"" the course material within Lesson Pro, it doesn't need to be continuously updated--unless there is new mandatory material to be used.4.  Personally, I found Lesson Pro very user friendly and extremely comprehensive for a novice computer user.  It is not necessary to have extensive program knowledge nor extreme knowledge of technical language to use Lesson Pro.Technical Remarks: As stated before, the Lesson Pro is extremely user friendly.  If the teacher already has a lesson plan created, basically, it's just cut and past from there.....",5

I found it to be an extremely informative site documenting several historical events and eras from the Zhou Dynasty to to Tienanmen Square.  Not only does it cover historical events of Asia, but also most major religions such as Taoism and Buddhism that have existed there.  Not only was the site a huge source of Asian information, but it also contained links to other great resources.  The site did not have many pictures on the main page and it was not great to look at, but it did have links to many images and maps to reference visial aids.  Overall, this site was an excellent catalog of information that can be used by teachers and students alike.",5

1448,"NRU is a tutorial, simulation & lecture/presentation of a school setting where you, the student, are taught and tested on negative reinforcement using a ""lab"", a ""classroom lecture"" and a ""test"" which are all interactive.  These styles of teaching the concept of negative reinforcement do a fair job, and the homepage provides an ok description of the material and other concepts that relate to the material (Punishment, Positive Reinforcement, Extinction).  However, it takes much longer to ""experience"" or walk through this simulation than it would to simply learn the material in a more classic presentation.  I feel after thoroughly completing this tutorial that there would be some benefit to assigning it to students of an introductory level college course or in high school psychology, but overall students would find it frusterating in that it is excessively time consuming for the amount of material it attempts to teach.Technical Remarks:Walking through the tutorial takes way too long and becomes frusterating quckly.  The Quality of content is good. The Effectiveness as a teaching tool is okay and the easy of use is frusterating and time consuming therefore poor Overall the simulation is okay, and I realize that when it was made in 1996 that it would be considered a great accomplishment, however 12 years later I feel that it does not hold that same strength.  p.s. if you do not want to spend the time finding out the code to get out of the dungeon or into the other rooms the sequence is triangle, circle, triangle, circle, circle,",3

However, one instructor commented early on about ""we don't know if you are logging on just because you logged on; you must post something for us to know that you are there."" Almost every LMS and discussion board tool has a logging feature, so seeing that someone logged on and read a post is not only possible, it is usually built right in.

1. It is updated on a regular basis to provide a good variety of new resources.
2. The resources include many of Google's tools for teachers. Each of these is excellent and user-friendly. Each is more intuitive than complex and can be explored and mastered by any individual who spends time on the site.
3. The tools included would be useful in the learning process as opposed to being teacher tools only. They are great examples of ""technology for learning"" as well as ""technology for teaching"".

Google has other tools available and a teacher would do well to try each of them. They are all available through links through Google's home page. They provide a range of excellent tools, technologies, and disciplines for communication, critical thinking, and specific skill-building.Technical Remarks:Mr. Wicks has provided the sites without instructions for using them, leaving that to the user. The sites are relatively self-explanatory and user-friendly. Most of the tools could be used by teachers with lower skill level in technology. Some of the Google tools would take some time to master, like Picasa and Sketch-Up.

If it is used in these fashions correctly, both the teacher's and the students' use will be able to utilize the computer for its most proficient use...more information for more individuals.Technical Remarks:The technical issues for this are quite simple. The entire idea is how to resolve technical difficulties with how many may use the computer in a given amount of time.

One of the fundamental flaws with faculty choosing and using Web 2.0 technologies is that there is no administrative oversight by the institution. This may sound like a blessing, but from a legal standpoint, it puts the institution at extreme risk and often unnecessarily exposes student information to public scrutiny. Also (again, within the US), everything a student submits as part of a course immediately becomes a part of that student's academic record and must be available to institutional administration for purposes of disputes and must be protected. Having someone on staff to advise on these issues is a must.",3

1508,This is a pretty cool concept. It definitely would be meant for students that were geared towards computer technology and applications.  I could see some students that were less familiar with technology may struggle.  I assume the students that would be in your class doing this lesson would have the skills background to do this.  I might provide students with a list of safe programs or applications or even recommend them based on ease of use. Good Job!,5

1522,"I'm not fan of puzzles and I'm not very good when it comes to math so I thought it would be interesting to try a few puzzles from this website. The puzzles cover the topics of geometry, probability, number theory, algebra, calculus, and logic. I didn't know where to begin but fortunately, as the website states, ""each puzzle is assigned a level of difficulty of between one and four stars."" I tried solving a few of the puzzles that were rated a one star level of difficulty but I'm a little rusty on my math skills and I wasn't able to solve them. Even though I wasn't able to solve any of the puzzles I tried while visiting the site I get the impression that using this site is probably one of the more fun learning tools to practice math, and that it is a good way to stretch your brain in a mathematical sense (which means that it has the potential to be academically stimulating). I imagine that the website is also a good recreational activity for people who simply enjoy puzzles or mathematics in general. What I liked most about this site is that hints, answers, complete solutions are offered which allows a student to help get started or still learn something even if they are clueless on how to approach a problem. There are also links to related mathematical topics available which can be accessed by clicking on the ""home"" link.Technical Remarks:Easy to naviagte and easy to find a puzzle that suitable for your own level of dificulty.",4

1526,"Many corporations should learns from Adam  Grants' analysis ""that people in high task significant jobs are usually more motivated and are happier at work.""  With this information managers should incorporate ways to bring this to all their employees, especially the employees whose jobs do not have immediate impact on others. Managers should introduce the high task significance through Organization development, forming teams and giving incentives to their employees through raises or highlighting how the employees work has helped others.  This would be very motivating to workers whose jobs are more behind the scenes and do not feel directly how they have benefited many customers. Marina (student)",4
1526,"It's a good interview about task significance and motivation. Task significance is basically working to make a positive impact on other people's lives. When the workers learn how their task is significant, they become more motivated. A motivated employee is a happy employee and happy employees are more willing to put in more effort and time in their work. This also makes a more positive environment so workers are able to work with each other more easily",4
1526,"It is really good interview. I learn what task significance from Adam. I know that how job work bring the motivation to the employee. It is ture that high task significance makes people more power to work. Employee can has the high performance. Also, The point that Adam said that organization should share the stories to impact others is very good because the employees have more knowledge about what they difference from others and get more successful.",4

1526,"Enjoyed this Podcast very much. I would have never actualy thought about this until I listened to this interview. Now that I think about it, when I used to work at a Doctor's office, I used to process precsription authorizations with health insurance companies for our patiens. It made a big differency to me when the patients would come in and thank me personaly, and sometimes even bring me gifts if I got their medication approved. This made me feel that I was really doing something important as well as made me want to work harder to help these patients are in pain. Definitely good topic to think about.",5
1526,"I feel that task significance is very important from an organizational and customer stand point. I worked as a Patient Coordinator which had me calling patients all over the country to inform them of the treatment they had inquired about. We were required to use a script and like Adam Grant said, we were mistaken as telemarketers and were often hung up on. After we reevaluated our approach, more had more and more patients respond to our calls. In the end we were able to help out more people because we changed the way we introduced ourselves to them as people who are there to help them and not to sell them something.",5
1526,"I really enjoyed watching this Podcast. A high task significance job is depending on what you do to help the others and benefit the others. As a customer service agent, i understand how important to make the coustomer feel happy and satisfied. I really enjoy doing this type of job since i like to help the others. On the other hands, i can get somethiing i want from the customers, such as happiness and respect.",4
1526,"Adam Grant described that Task Significant is the positive impact for employees.  Especially when employees have direct connection to the people they help.  I found that his research is interesting.  Like most of us, we think that the good way to motivate an employee is to provide competetive pay, opportunity to be promoted.  But let the employees knew that their contribution to job can actually helping other is another good way.  The example of the University call center and the lifeguard proof his point.",5
1526,"I really like this podcast interview! Task significance is something that is around us but sometimes not seen when it is even in front of us. I felt really connected to this interview because until now I can see that what I want to do once I graduate is a task significance job. I want to be a dietitian to help the unfortunate and improve their health with a pay they are able to do: it’s for their improvement not for my wallet. I didn’t even realize that it could be tough even when you do have a task significant job. Noticing that your job is task significant is important and seeing the results of your job. I couldn’t have imagined that life guards would be between two walls because they need to prevent anyone from being in danger yet they want to dive in and save lives. I do believe the connection with the people and hearing stories really does make a difference especially because it’s easy to forget why we are doing that particular job. Lastly, I want to say that I loved how Adam Grant brought a little bit of laughter within the interview. I’ll be recommending this podcast to people I know.",5
1526,"I really like what Adam Grant said because task significance is very important to whatever you do especially at work. If everyone know what their tasks are and their goal, they will do better with their job and that's what makes everyone successful. I work in a place where task significance is very important. I'm a supervisor and for to keep my position, I need to keep up my task and my goal. For me to successful I need to know what I need to work on and also all the task I need to do. Since we also have a sale plan to make, I always try to think a of a way to make plan or what are we doing wrong why we are not making plan. Ofcourse I can't do it my school, to make sales plan. its all about team work. I have to look at associates and thank them for what their doing good and also tell them what their opportunities to succeed. I definetly agree with Adam.",5
1526,"I really enjoyed listening to this podcast.  I agree with what Adam said, because people are losing a lot of motivation in their lines of work.  They begin with huge ambitions, but without seeing the full result of what they are doing, they feel discouraged and bored in their work.  This type of thinking can be used in learning as well.  As long as we find the significance and find the relative connection of how learning in a boring class can help our lives or futures, we would feel motivated to learn and give ourselves the feeling of task significance.",5
1526,"I liked the interview with Adam Grant and found it very inspiring to bring task significance to jobs. He makes you want to be consistently happy at work and make everything a happier place. I agree with him with his research about workers being more motivated, happier, and more satisfied with their job because of task significance. Working with people who contribute to task significance make it easier and less stressful to work in an environment as opposed to a negative worker. It's a nice concept to bring constant social contributions to work.",4
1526,"It was very interesting to listen and to learn about the concept ""Task Significance"" that Adam Grant talks about in his interview. ""Task Significance"" is giving an opportunity to an employee to do work that has a positive impact on the well being of other people. The person allows high social contribution of helping co-workers or other people.  It is a benefit that helps other people in their work places.I think that the whole idea about ""Task Significance"" is to increase employee motivation for the employee that was not enthusiastic about his/her job. It increased the employees desire to work longer hours, and to do a job well-done. I really enjoyed listening to that interview.",4
1526,"Adam makes many valid points, specifically listing certain jobs where employees can ""lose sight"" of their responsibilities.  Task Significance revolves around motivating employees, motivation through opening the eyes of employees to allow them to see that their job does indeed make a difference.  Adam's goal is to see whether or not Task Significance makes a difference in real world jobs.",3
1526,"The interview on task significance was very interesting to listen to. I believe task signifiance is very important because it allows employees to feel statisfaction about their work. A person always feels happy and statisfied with they see their work helping others in life. The Farmers Insurance company enforces task significance in their new commericals as they emphasis that their employees know their clients on a personal level. For example I get statisfaction when I get comments on my work. So in a workforce heavily dedicated to make products for people, i can see how interaction with the cleints on a personal can improve motivation and self satisfication.",4
1526,"I think this interview video about task significance is very interesting and useful. The video talks about the importance of task significance and targets different jobs that might benefit with high task significance. As I’ve learned, having high task significance is not only crucial to job performances but also to the employees own job satisfactions. Most people tend to enjoy their job more when they know that they are helping the people they want to help. The video talks about different jobs that don’t really require the workers to actually see their customers. But having different ideas to raise job significance, like the caller job or the life guard job he talked about, can really make them more satisfied with their job.",4
1526,"This podcast was truly interesting. Adam Grant brough up some interesting concepts business should implement.  I worked for a company writing custome applications for internal use.  Initially I would write them and send them out and never really talked with he employees about it.  I got to the point of frustation about the tedious process.  I was able to relate this to my job.  After some talking with my boss, I was able to work with the employees and the job enusthiastic improved almost 10 fold.",4
1526,"I really enjoyed this interview regarding Adam Grant's study regarding Task Significance on job performance.  For years, management teams have been told that salary is not the way to motivate employees long term.  But for many organizations, that is still the primary tool used. Here, Mr. Grant demonstrates a relatively simple concept that seemingly has the ability to create a measurable impact on employee job satisfaction thereby improving motivation and performance.I thought the invisible task significance was a really interesting concept.  The example of Auto engineers working on safety features intellectually know that their work saves lives and prevent accidents but actually lose sight of that significance.  Management could easily assume that this high task significance stays with the engineers, or that it doesn't really matter to their overall performance and motivation.  Clearly, Mr. Grant's interventions show it has a high effect.In many large, global organizations employees increasingly feel disconnected and ""just a number"" putting in their hours.  I believe if organizations take the time to remind employees of the affect their work has on others and connect them to those benefiting from their work the effects would also include increased employee engagement, self esteem, and lower stress levels.",4
1526,I found the point about the students that were “cold callers” very intriguing. Trying to raise money for a school is a difficult task especially when in a recession. They are calling alumni and other who had received help or attend the school in the past. These callers are not always welcomed by the individual on the other end of the phone. As a caller they may feel that they are making little to zero progress in acquiring money for the school due to the high failure rate. They need to see how well they are doing as a total to show that they actually are making a difference in the task at hand. This job is high in task significance and the caller should have the opportunity to see what effect they are making. Another similar story was the job of a Lifeguard. Many will never have to jump into a pool and have to save a life. Adams had a great idea to use stories from the media about how a lifeguard had saved a drowning victim to motivate other lifeguards.,4
1526,I totally agree that people who have more money at work are more motivated at work and are happier people- they have less worries then someone who doesnt make the money- Sometimes with gas prices theses days its expensive to even to drive to work to where its not even worth it sometimes.People with jobs they like and are motivated to work for develop a relationship with their job to where they actually care about their customersOrganizations also need to make a effort to always want to improve and re invent themselves to make themselves better and keep their employees motivatedTechnical Remarks:It took a long time to load on my computer- I tried a PC and a MAC- the MAC worked better :),5
1526,"I totally agree with this opinion. High task significance jobs are usually more motivated employees and make them feel happier at work. In the interview, Adam Grant has talk about Microsoft as an example for this issue. First of all, when they introduce the new software, it is only few people know how to use it. Hoever, latter on, they have changed and improve. All they have to do is deal with their employees. The people with high task jobs are listening to their customers, then are aware how to help the customers.In the articles, author has dicaded that high task significance is possible through Organizational Development; organizations cope with the changing environment through improved internal relationships with behavioral science techniques. Also, Adam Grant mentions that ""managers should form teams, give raises, or highlight how their work will help others."" It is absolutely true, doing so, the managers do not only know where are they but also where they want to be.",4
1526,"Adam Grant really makes a great point: one of the biggest problem with jobs with high task significance is that employees are disconnected from seeing the real impact it has on others. I liked his example of medical research scientists; they produce vaccines and cures for patients, but they never get a chance to meet the benefitors. Managers should create methods in which employees get to see how their work actually benefits and makes a difference on others. Adam Grant listed ways to actually achieve this: directly introduce employees to the people that benefits from their work and create forums where people can share their stories. As a manager, it's important to motivate employees and achieving high task significance is a powerful way to accomplish it.",5
1526,"I thought Adam Grants ideas on task significance made a lot of sense. It can help companies improve certain products that aren't working out for the general public, for example, the Microsoft product he mentioned in the interview. Six users didn't know how to use the new product and later was successful when the creators met the users and talked about the product. I agree with what he said about the positive impact on employers as well as the people that benefits from their work. He talked about automotive engineers and their job to keep drivers safe; medical researchers and their findings to help patients; authors and writers who benefits the readers by writing interesting books. If companies and their employers take the time to meet the people who benefit from their product or services, it can help both sides. Employers will be successful as well as consumers benefiting from their products and services.",4
1526,"I like the idea that to utilize task significance you could introduce workers to the customers who benefit from the job they are doing.  He did mention that people who have jobs with high task significance are happier and more motivated with their work.  It makes sense because if you know how what you do makes others happy, then you are more likely to be happy providing that to them.Technical Remarks: ",3
1526,"Hello,I think this podcast was very interesting. Grant expains his findings on the importance of task significance on job performance. Task significance means that the work employees do have a positive impact in others. His theory proposes that the more employes know about the positive impact on others, the more motivated, and satisfied the employees are, which in turn creates a  more meaningful job. The jobs of managers is to highlight task sigificance to workers so they perform better at work. I find this research interesting but in a way its intuitive that peole like to help others.  In my opinion Grant in proposing a paradigm shift from the Theory of management X worker, to theory of management Y. In theory X workers are self interested, prefer to be directed, and wish to avoid responsability, whereas in Theory Y workers enjoy work, are self- directed, and comitted.  I think Grant's findings support Theory Y because its proves that workers are not selfish, wiil  help others, and will perform better for others. It is as asset as a manager to have this information because one could devise programs to increase motivation by showing employees that their work matters.Thanks!",5
1526,"I think those people who loses site of their task significance should take a day off or two and see what kind of benefits they are doing for their customers. And I believe that if they see the benefits they are doing, then it will boost their motivation or give them back the passion they once had for doing what they do.",4
1526,"As Adam Grant says, a high task significance job is a type of job that makes a difference and helps others, such as educate people, help coworkers, benefit customers. This type of jobs are usually more motivating and making people happier at work. I agree with this totally. People will always get more motivated and happier when they realize that they are benefiting others or the society. Thats why there are so many non-profit organizations.",3
1526,"I was never aware of the theory of ""task significance"" and after listening to the podcast I believe that if  this theory is applied to companies many employees will be motivated and productive in their jobs and produce  better outcomes for the companies they work for. I believe that it is important to be happy at work and many employees are not aware of their job significance and impact to others. To make these employees aware of their job significance would most likely reflect a better attitude and better communication among each other in the workplace. In addition, it would also bring more cooperation beetween employees to finish their tasks in which would probably bring alliance.",4
1526,"I don't think most people put enough thought into their ""task significance."" lol. The more efficient workers are can greatly affect the impact of an organization.  Prioritizing objectives from least to most important can ensure that the more meaningful jobs get done creating a stable environment for all who enter.",4
1526,"I fully agree that employees who work in high significance jobs will be more motivated, satisfied, and excited with their job. For employees who do work in these highly significant jobs, I would find it hard for them to meet all these people who's lives they are influencing or saving. Volvo's idea with the ""Volvo Saved My Life Club"" is a very good idea for keeping their engineers motivated to keep pushing the envelope in new innovations. Most companies might not be able to afford such programs to keep their employees motivated so it is easy to see why so many people are not motivated with their current occupation. Managers are continuing to to find ways to reward and show employees how their work actually does affect lives hoping that these ""success"" stories will keep employees wanting to do more and more. Mostly this interview was telling us what we already know, you hear about stories on the television when someone almost died in a fire, and a few months later they get to meet their savior. These are great stories, but not all of the time are these saviors rewarded with getting to meet these people who's life they saved.",3
1526,"Task significance is something I never really considered until I listened to this podcast.  I work as a cashier at a restaurant and though it may not seem like there's a likely chance of task significance in this field, there actually is in my opinion.  I love making customers happy and building relationships with them.  I greet customers with a friendly hello and how are you doing today? Also, I recognize a customer's voice through the phone simply because they are a regular customer that orders take out maybe like 2-3 times a week and know them by face.  As a result, the benefit i get from some customers is getting tip, which is extra cash aside from my hourly wage.  The benefit the customer gets is having a relationship and building loyalty to the restaurant.  We let the customer know that we are reliable and the restaurant they can count on when it comes to quality service and food.",5
1526,"This is a great podcast demonstrating the importance of ""task significance,"" and how when employees are aware of how their work benefits others it motivates them and has a positive impact on their work.  I think that more companies need to create a better connection between the workers and the people that they positively impact.  I work retail and I know that I have a better day at work when I am able to really help someone and they acknowledge how much I was able to assist them.",4
1526,"This is Adam Grant shares dramatic effect of task significance on job performance which is very interesting. I liked he described jobs where people are working and benefiting others but not having to meet these consumers. I think everyone has their own motivation and high task significance jobs does not necessarily mean that that employee is satisfied with their work. If your job does not have any significance that does not mean that your job is not beneficial for others, its just that your job may be significant in another way. Overall very interesting interview.",4
1526,"I found this topic quite interesting. Task Significance seems like such a simple concept, but a lot of organizations overlook it's ability to affect the performance of their employees.",4
1526,"Very interesting topic, great how Adam shares his view on task significance. I liked how he described jobs where people are working and benefiting others but not having to meet these consumers.

If your job does not have any significance that does not mean that your job is not beneficial for others, its just that your job may be significant in another way. Overall very interesting interview.",4
1526,"I find that creating task significance goes both ways: from the employer and from the employee.  The disconnect between the tasks and their ""positive"" and ""meaningful"" impacts stem from how employer treat their employees and how employees perceive their tasks.  But as Grant explained, impediments to task significance include unappreciative employers and employees who perceive their work as monotonous (e.g. lifeguards).  I agree that employers can create a work environment to help motivate employees.  However, I find that some tasks just do not perform social benefits to society.  Unlike the examples cited (alumni fundraising and lifeguarding), how can tasks in scamming agencies be task significant? Additionally, there's a basic assumption by Grant that people want to do work that makes a positive difference and want to have their employees become more ""conscious"" about their significance of their tasks.  I don't think everyone is socialized to want to make a difference in the world in a positive way.  Furthermore, what does Grant mean by ""positive""?  Would mountain-top mining be considered as positive?  for some, I am sure, would consider that as positive, in that it provides the necessary resources to run our economy.  But for others, I believe they would argue otherwise.  So I think this podcast (and Grant's research) is a window dressing for making people feel good about their insignificant tasks.",3
1526,"this is a great idea. but sometimes it's very hard to motivated imployee, and it's even harder to keep them motivated. Like to share the story, the lifeguard for example, watch some vedio about how other lifeguard save people's life, even make me want become a lifeguard, but the encourage moment can't last long. also, for other business, especially for small business, very difficult to find a way to make empolyee think they are high needed in the business. howerver, this is a good idea for people to think about it.",4
1526,"This is great stuff. It's common sense that thankful jobs would be more fulfilling for the employee, but there's a huge number of jobs that are widely assumed to be impactful or important, and yet the people involved never see the results of their work. I'm glad that somebody came up with the idea of showing people the significance of their work.",4
1526,"I really like how he developed this important topic by giving his own experiences and some outside examples such as Microsoft Co, very detailed. In addition, he makes great focus on Social contribution in this case the work that benefit others. It is also important to be aware of Invisible Task Significance which Mannagers need to know so they can perfom better du to motivation.",4
1526,"Interesting idea for motivation for employees. I believe this can be extremely effective in organizations if it can work in the industries with the highest turnover rate. The only issue I see is consistency. Motivation can only last so long and people need to be reminded of their ""task significance."" I would like to see better forms of measurement for lifeguards than just more hours per week.I am curious as to see the different people that are affected by different industries and a list ranking the highest task significance jobs.Something to think about for current and future managers of businesses.",4
1526,"Good talks about task significance in a work place. The material was easy to comprehend and follow. It's true what Adam mentioned, business that is task-oriented is more productive.",4
1526,"I find it interesting that the importance of task significance is actually discussed; to me it is just obvious.  However, it is good to know that research on the matter had a positive turnout. At Microsoft developers that had contact with users, by observing them through a mirror, started to indentify with the users and worked harder to fix the bugs.  Metronics brings in some cured patients to their annual party, and it inspired biochemists and other lab help; who do not normally get to see the positive effects of the medicine they helped created.  In both cases recognition of the employees task significance improved their attitude and motivation towards their work. This is a relief because if that was not the case I might once and for all fall victim to deep depression.",4
1526,Its interesting that just these little suggestions can have such a large effect on the lifeguards and the fundraisers.  Its amazing that by just introducing a student under scholarship or showing lifeguards examples of how their jobs had made a difference elsewhere can have such a significant impact on their jobs.  All organizations should use these types of techniques to motivate and improve their employees productivity.  It is good to be reminded how much of a difference employees can make.,4
1526,"Very interesting! I like how he relates his thoughts to what is being explained. for instance, the use of ""journalist who write but never meet those who benefit from his writings"". the way he relates his explanations to real life really helps listeners to understand and connect to what's said.Also, i think he's right! to know how your affecting someone you truly have to understand their feelings. if a doctor wants to cure someone they first must find the problem. it applies to everything we do, to significantly finish a task, we must effectively understand what's the needs of those being affected.Task significance is all about understanding those whom you help so i think its important you understand your task and audience.",4
1526,Adam Grant's research on task significance is interesting.  The two samples he used perfectly demonstrated the frustration employees feel when they don't realize the importance or impact of the work they do.  Managers should use the results of this study to motivate their employees.  I like the three suggested ways that managers can increase awareness of employee’s task significance.Every holiday season the company I work for collects donations for the St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  Every week we get a letter from a child that is being treated at St. Jude's.  It is so emotional and reminds us of the great cause we are working towards.  It motivates us to not just ask for the donation but to sincerely ask with a sense of purpose and passion.,4
1526,"I agree with Adam Grant and have seen a difference at my own jobs when Task Significance is brought to employees attention. Even just in retail, I have done training programs to make a more personal experience between clients and employees and I believe that creates a different environment which encourages employee effort and satisfaction. I know that making people feel good by selling them clothing isn't exactly doing a great deed for the world but it does show that Task Significance makes a difference in any workplace. When people feel a more personal attachment and see a difference due to their work, they are automatically more satisfied with what they accomplished.",3
1526,"I agree with Adam Grant on his study, and I do experience it at my work place. I work at a hotel where I meet and deal with hundreds of people, each with different needs and preferences. We have a program at work that's called GSS (Guest Satisfactory Survey), which is a survey that is sent to guests after checking out of our hotel asking them about their stay which they can rate us with, and leave comments or recommendations. We print the GSS every week to see our progress and comments. The point that Adam Grant did not talk about was the negative side. I do look forward to read the GSS to know how we are doing towards our guests and how we can make their stay a better experience. When I get a positive comment from a guest, I get very happy and excited to see that I'm doing a good job and I keep doing it in the future. But, I also look for guests who didn't like the way I treated them, or the way I dealt with a situation that concerned them, and I take that negative comment and think of a way to get better at what I do and how I work around the hotel. To me, this is also a motivation as I care about my job and I like taking a good care of our guests. I like my guest to have the best experience ever, and over the years I have built a decent portfolio and background in my career. And I don't stop there, but everytime I go somewhere and I stay at different hotels, I do observe how other people in guest services work around hotels and deal with different situations, and I learn also from them. If I experience something that I like, I do add it to my experience and try to apply it on guest at our hotels. But, if I don't like a behavior from another person in guest services, I try to stay away from it. At the end, an important point that Adam Grant missed is the passion that each individual has towards what he/she does.",4
1526,"After I listened ""Task Significance"". I agree that good companies always understand to the customer's need. Good managenment is possible to do right innovation, such is providing new products and services.",4
1526,"Motivation is a very important role in life, once someone loses it, it could be a problem in their life. I could think of several examples, but the dominant in my mind right now is an example of a researcher in a lab. Considering a lab researcher who is working on a new experiment for a new hypothesis. In a research, experiments and observations have to be done over and over with different variables to see what exactly works and gives a result. If the researcher keeps hitting walls in the experiments, which means not finding a decent result that could answer its hypothesis, he/she, after several attempt, could lose motivation. For he/she is working hard for a long time without getting any results, it gets to be depressing and the researcher gets to a point where he/she gives up working towards the original hypothesis. On the other hand, if he/she gets decent results, the motivation would be a great push towards completing the research and maybe turning the hypothesis into a theory.",4
1526,"I'm impressed by Adam Grant's study and the way he highlights on his point. I was not aware of the term Task Significance, yet I knew of its existence in the real world. After listening to the podcast, I thought of few of my fellow schoolmates who had some kind of learning disorder. They would study hard on their own, but when they go to the exam or test, their result would be disappointing as they failed or barely made it through. After several failings and the fact that they didn't see any good result of their hard work at school, they got to a point where they gave up and quit school, which is horrible for their future. But, if they had a help to realize their disorder and work on it, I'm sure that they would have seen good results, as I have seen it happen with other people later on; therefore, they would have been more motivated to continue their learning as they felt and realized they can do a difference in their life.",4
1526,"After I listened ""Task Significance"". I think It is very good idea to help the employees. I like the example of ""Microsoft"". It is easy to use the softwave after ameliorate. Employees help each other because the task significance. It will be very useful if more company take the ""Task Significance"".",4
1526,"I believe the idea of task significance is a great idea. It is important for people to feel as though they are making a difference, or that they are doing something for the better. I believe that employee's need some sort of motivation. Some may just need to know that the job they are doing has helped change someones life, or some people might need something else in addition to that. I beleive that people need  goals and motivation, that would be the perfect combonation. To not only know you are working for the better, but to also know you have something better to work for.",4
1526,"i think this interview about ""task significance"" is very helpful and interesting. Lot people work everyday to benefit others but they never have a chance to meet each other. By helping people to understand their task significance, people can be more motivated and satisfied in what they're doing. This leads to a more productive way for the work.",4
1526,"I thought this was a pretty interesting interview.  I certainly agree with the fact that people are more motivated to work when they know people out there rely and depend on the results of their work.  Motivation would of course then lead to satisfaction and workers would be more productive.  It is good to know that don't just work for their self-interests, but for other people's interests as well.",4
1526,"The information that Adam Grant gives in his interview is stellar. His talk on task significance is extremely interesting and informative for students and managers alike. Essentially Task Significance is basically a benchmark to show how much social impact an individual’s job has on others. For example a job with high task significance would be a Fire Fighter. Fire Fighters save people’s homes, their lives, and treat them in car accidents; this is obviously a job with high task significance. Adam’s goals in his examples are to show others what their Task Significance is at their job. 
Adam spoke on the importance of other job modifiers such as pay, run for advancement, and acknowledgement, but he found through his research that people were more motivated when they knew the end result of their job had an effect on others. For example, Adam used a test group of Pool Lifeguards to conduct a test regarding task significance. Normally they don’t rescue people from the pool, so there was a lot of Lifeguards with little to no attention spent on the job; so Adam decided to show the Lifeguards stories on other Lifeguards saving people’s lives. The result was that more Lifeguards wanted to work more hours and that their managers found that the visitors to these pools were more satisfied with their visit than from before. This clearly shows that Task Significance is an important tool that can be used to motivate employees to new heights; employees want to see that their job is rewarding and fulfilling professionally.
Adam’s research and examples given in the interview were clear and concise. He never made anything confusing or boring. He made Task significance extremely interesting and his approaches to showing employees how much their jobs really meant were excellent.  I plan to use some of his approaches in my job someday.Technical Remarks:Audio played without issue. The interviewer was clear and concise with his questions.",4
1526,"Task significance is extremely important for every role and every job out there. This is what will make employees care about what they do and will motivate them to improve their work performance. 

I find it hard to realize what the task significance is in being a bank teller because the company that I work for don't quite define it. We're expected to meet our daily referral goals, but there is no motivation for us to do so. The job has become tedious and it's come to the point where tellers don't even seem like they're needed. They expect us to meet our numbers, but many associates feel like there is no point. I'm sure if we had an idea of the task significance in it, we would be more motivated to work harder and complete our goals.",4
1526,"This video is about adam grant, who talks about task significance; which is doing work that will help others and make a social contribution i.e. (building relationships, helping people, etc.)
-	Its about getting employees doing work do benefit other people (task significance)
-	automotive engineers are invisible contributors as well as authors and journalists (a couple jobs that make a difference)
-	He explained how he worked with a traveling guide industry that helped out people with their travel search. Their task significance affects motivationso the more meaningful and motivated with work, the higher the Task Significance.
-	He wanted to help fundraising callers with their task significance.
o	He had workers and college students meet up once in a while, and tried to get interaction out of both parties
o	Callers more than doubled after he came in
-	life guarding was another example he mentioned about being high in task significance even though it was hard to keep lifeguards on since they never had much practice as it is ( not being able to perform a rescue), he wanted them to realize how important there jobs were in society. 
o	They volunteered to work more hours and worked longer in duration
-	A lot depended on what type of employee you were (not consciousness were the one who needed reasons to work)
-	He wants everyone in the work place to somehow to open up conversation and interact, the more everyone can make a difference.Technical Remarks:Everything was very easy to find and easy to use. I love efficiency.",5
1526,"I thought what Adam Grant had to say was very interesting and informative. He connects the work people do to the ones who benefit from their services. I believe everything he said was very valid. When people realize their work has an impact on others and the world they are more likely to work harder, and be happier while doing it.Technical Remarks:Very easy to use and understand.",4
1526,This was a very informative interview with Adam Grant about employees seeing the significance or importance of their work on other people. Its very interesting how he made the argument that employees and not just self interested but actually care when they see their work benefiting others. I really liked his examples of businesses actually applying this in the workplace and its correlation to higher job satisfaction and ultimately better job performance.,4
1526,"In this interview Adam Grant stated that when workers lost track of the significance of their own jobs they have tendency to fail to live up their potential. He also stated that workers with higher task significance are frequently more motivated and satisfied at work. This tell us that rather than extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation is more important to motivate the workers.",4
1527,"This is a great tutorial on how to use PsycINFO. It includes a break down of different topics in the order in which you would need to apply them. The tutorials are interactive and a woman's or a man's voice walks you through each step. After each tutorial there is a short quiz that allows you to test your knowledge of what you have learned. This is great for freshman and sophomores who are unfamiliar with how to begin a research paper. It breaks down the difference between a popular and a scholarly article which often seems to present problems for beginner researchers. Although there are a few sections that are specific to Georgia State University, those sections can be easily skipped. This should not deter anyone from using it though, because most of the tutorials are helpful for anyone and apply to anyone using PsycINFO.Technical Remarks:This tutorial was easy to use. Each section is also available in a PDF file so that they can be printed as handouts. You can also print the quizzes for use in class. It is very user friendly, and covers all of the important topics. I would recommend this for students and for teachers who are working with students who are writing their first research paper. It can also gives some helpful tips for experienced writers who have never learned about all of the helpful techniques PsycINFO offers.",4

1530,"I have used Prezi as an alternative to PowerPoint for presentations.  I have noticed that audiences seem to be more engaged when I use it versus a slideshow.  Creating a show with Prezi has a little bit of a learning curve for a few different reasons: you are forced to think a little differently about how you want your audience to experience the information - it's not as linear as PowerPoint - and it might take some practice to figure out the spacing and speed of the animation so that your audience doesn't get seasick.  This could be a great collaborative tool for small groups to use to create concept maps or draw connections between material. There is a feature that allows you to import PowerPoint slides into Prezi but I haven't tried it, and I prefer to create something new anyway.  There are also some limitations as far as not being able to print it out well and only a few standard color/font schemes - which are customizable but still somewhat limited.  The Prezi community allows you to browse other Prezis that have been created for inspiration and use.  Technical Remarks:If using in a presentation, Prezi will not advance with the use of a wireless clicker (like PowerPoint slides can); you will still need to be at the podium to advance the show unless you set it up for autoplay.  App for iPad that allows you to edit.  ",4

1541,"This concept seems kind of obvious but also very effective.  I have worked for a couple of major companies and have seen it put to use.  One of the companies was in the Petrochemical industry.  Safety is a huge part of their culture.  They applied the principle of ""Safety First"" to every aspect of the company.  It didn't matter if you worked in the field or in an office they took safety very seriously.  One of the ways they did this was by having a ""safety moment"" before every meeting.  In my group we would rotate the duty of presenting a safety topic every week before our meetings.  I'm a skeptic at heart and it was hard for me to embrace this idea but in the end I appreciated the fact that we spent time discussing topics ranging from driving safety to ergonomics and many other things.  The idea is that we cared about our coworkers and wanted to see them go home safe be safe there and come back to work in the same condition.  It sounds kinda cheesy but in the end it made a huge impact on me, so much so that I have brought the concept of safety moments to positions I have held at other companies.",4

I read and took notes on the information for my own use in developing professional goals as a teacher.I was misled by the grammatical error in the title on the MERLOT list to believe this site would be an amateurish, possibly reductive list of educational standards.  Instead, I found a highly literate, professional, and well-thought-out examination of what makes a good teacher, and a proposal for a national board certification of good teachers.  Teacher evaluation in the profession is such a confusing, subjective process:  I had hoped to find a checklist to replace the ubiquitous (and notoriously inaccurate) student evaluation scores for ascertaining how good a teacher is.  I didn't find that; but the detailed discussions of various attributes of good teachers can certainly provide goals and personal objectives for teachers in their quest to improve.  While National Board Certification of good teachers is a worthy, commendable concept, methods of rating teachers along the specified lines are not laid out on this site.  Teacher/readers are therefore, albeit inspired, still left with the same old question:  how can we rank or reward good teaching?

I browsed through most of the links, and it provides a lot of information from what you can do with math, to new maths being discovered, to small math, and there is even a resource for teachers to use.

The content is not educationally significant in regards to learning certain math materials, although there are links that take you to sites that do have things like that. The forte of this site is not in how it teaches you concepts, but how math is related to us and our surroundings, including the ones that are solved and/or unsolved. It's effectiveness can help inspire students to be more interested in math and pursue a higher education in math. It is a lot easier to teach a student who have a desire and interest in math than a student who does not. This can be helpful in that sense.

For example, a search for the word ""dar"" resulted in twelve definitions with examples of how the verb ""to give"" can be used as a transitive verb, five ways it can be used as an intransitive verb, and 7 ways as a reflexive verb. To the left of the definition, the word appears in the middle of a vertical list of twenty words in alphabetical order. This is a nice feature if you want to look up a different form of the word easily. Only single words can be entered, however, there are instructions for looking up the word used in an expression. Mike Kellogg, the author of the site, has a sense of humor. In his FAQ he addresses this issue and says ""this is just a dictionary.  Use it as you would use a regular dictionary.  If you would like to receive a (bad) translation of an entire web page, there are plenty of companies doing that such as AltaVista's Babelfish.""My Spanish classes have used this dictionary for several years in and out of the classroom or LRC with great success. I myself have linked to it on many of my web pages for easy access. For example, in the Language Resource Center if students are working in pairs on another study module, they can easily open two browser windows and switch back and forth from the dictionary to the assigned work. Since the words are defined and then used in context there is less likelihood
 that students will produce such creations as the classic ""ir espalda"" for ""to go back"" or ""tener un buen tiempo"" for ""divertirse.""The free WordReference search box can be added very easily to your own website by copying and pasting some simple HTML code. The  translation will open in a new browser window. The search box can also be modified to include selected languages. The search box is small and unobtrusive.If I were a PC user I would love this next feature. WordReference can be used as a browser add-on tool. WordReference Personal works with Windows and comes in two forms, one for Internet Explorer, one for Netscape.  The download is free and fast. To  translate any word on any web page, double-click the word to highlight it, click the right mouse button, and chose from the menu. A small window will then open with the translation in the corner of the screen. Unfortunately this option is not available for Macs.Technical Remarks: The dictionary loads quickly, has an uncluttered interface, and a good font size for easy reading. It is very easy to use and the directions are clear. There is a FAQ page with some short suggestions from the author. There are no irritating pop-up windows or flashing banners for advertising. There is a single advertisement banner (for matchmaker.com at the time of this writing)  at the top. There is no login required. The WordReference search box can be installed on both PCs and Macs, however, it is available as a browser add-on tool for only PCs. ",5
1563,"Clear voice-over PPT, made into a video. The voice tone is a little flat, and stumbles occasionally. Information is accurate and useful. The material is text-heavy, with little imagery. Includes formative quiz with feedback. The content includes research-based data, which is useful. I'm wondering if the author has the info I typed in (part of digital footprint). Apparently this PPT is part of a 30-60 minute lesson, which I do not see linked.",4
1563,"This Stair answered alot of questions about digital foot prints. The recommendations are very timely in this technical age. I liked the voice and the written dialogue. I do wish you changed the delivery in your narration. I do feel the presentation is very educational. It is very informative about removing inaccurate personal information and adding accurate information more prominately on search engines.Technical Remarks:When I took quiz 1, it sent me back to the beginning of the quiz even though I had already completed the quiz correctly. When I finished the second quiz, it sent me back twice even though I had answered correctly. The presentation has a replay button to review the material if you answered incorrectly or to review the material.",4
1564,"This particular site looks like it may have been built originally using Prezi, or a similar presentation building site. While I did enjoy taking the quizzes, one did not work, and another gave a result that was inconclusive and used poor grammar.  Overall, it was interesting, but I would not use this as a tool for class.",3
1565,I will use in the classroom.Technical Remarks:it was user friendly,5
1566,"This is a wonderful beginning in an area that needs work - adapting science environments for individuals with special needs!  There are links to software that have assistive technology available.  There also are tips and suggestions for adaptating the environment.

Nevertheless, user will grasp the basics of options trading in a very short time whether used as an in-class demonstration or a self-study tool.",3
1569,This site could be easily used directly as a powerpoint in the classroom to teach students how to identify artifact material. Includes helpful tips and photographs.,4
1569,Such great photos of how to look at patient samples and determine common errors that occur in determining parasites,4
1570,Good illustration of technique and application.Technical Remarks: Would be nice to show cDNA samples binding to some probes and not to others in detail.  This is usually a sticking point for students.  Also explaining that when the cDNA from both cells binds that the computer registers this as a yellow dot.  Adding a few frames to illustrate this would be great.,4
1571,Need to change back ground color to one that is more pleasing to the eye. But good sorce of material  for med school qualifications,3
1572,There is a plethora of information however it is not well organized/accessible. It would be difficult for a student to determine what is credible and what is not and to quickly overview and navigate the website. Where the information appears to be accurate the delivery and format does not support what I would hope for in an academic resource for students.  ,2
1572,Accurate information on Personality disorders using DSM criteria.  Could replace basic text book information for some health sciences students.Technical Remarks:no problems,4
1572,I spent almost 2 hours browsing this site...anything and everything you ever wanted to know about personality disorders.  Very informativeTechnical Remarks: easy to navigate..alot of info,5
1572,Very good information. It allowed me to learn a great deal about symptoms of personality disorders and ways to treat them. This information can be usefull in the future in case I encounter people with personality disorders and allow me to understand them a little more.,4
1572,I spent several hours on at least two different days browsing the site. I liked the majority of the information presented and found it easy to understand. There were a few disorders that were some what vague in their definition or referred to other disorders which you would have had to look up if you were not familiar with them. I think this could be used for enhanced teaching and learning. Easy to use site.,4
1572,"I spent about 75 minutes browsing,and used it for a class discussion. I thought the quality was great, and the wealth of links available were too, and it does accurately present concepts. I believe enhancement is for sure.Technical Remarks: easy navigation, great links!!",4
1572,"Really good site, lots of good info....spent a lot of time searching aroundTechnical Remarks: easy to navigate and find what you are intersted in",4

1572,"I spent approximately 1 1/2 hours clicking on all the different topics on the side bar, after reading the introduction.  I feel the information is very educationally significant.  It was straight to the fact and got the information across well so people could understand it and learn from it.  This resource could definitely enhance teaching and learning.  It is broken down into categories under certain disorders.  You just click on it and it takes you straight to the necessary information without having to search through long documents looking for what you are interested in knowing. Technical Remarks: As I was a first time user, I found the software very easy to use.  The introduction was listed first with every related topic on the side that I could click on to find the necessary information.  The whole software program was very user friendly.  I was impressed with it.",5
1572,"I spent a half hour reviewing the material.  I though it was a great website.  It gave alot of explanation and made it easy for me to understand.  It gave alot of symptoms of different disorders.Technical Remarks: If i had to do this in an educational setting, i think it might be a little hard.  I thought it was a little unorganized, but other than that, it was a good site.",4
1572,"I spent one hour researching this website and found the contents exceptional.  The information in this website gives the reader enough information to find the causes and treatments on personality disorders.  A person who needs information, be it for learning or teaching, will find this website highly effective in producing the needed information. I find the website very easy to use even for a first time user.I will recomend this website to my friends and family members.",5
1572,"I spent an hour and a half looking at just a few of the great material presented on this site.  I thought the quality of content was wonderful, and I think that the materials were accurately presented and are educationally significant.  This site would definitely enhance students learning and faculty's teaching.Technical Remarks: First time users would find this site very easy to move around on.  Everything is listed, and the accessibility to a wide range of information is provided.",5
1572,"I spent a while looking through various websites. Probably a half hour or a little less. The quality of the content was good, but it was not very organized. It just seemed like a bunch of random websites that could fall under a heading like clinical psychology. I think it would be pretty much useless for a classroom learning environment.Technical Remarks: It was easy to browse through, but I think if I had to go through this site in a learning environment, I would have a harder time with it. I did not care for it very much, but the idea is good.",2
1572,This is an interesting site that gives the symptoms and treatments for 10 different personality disorders. It also offers links to other sites with information. There is a tremendous amount of information on this site. It would make a great source for a research paper. I spent awhile checking it out as it was very informative and interesting.Technical Remarks: This site was very easy to navigate.  It is very clear and hops from one topic to the next.,4
1572,I spent about an hour or so serching this site. I could've spent more it had so much to offer.  Th content and quality of it was great.  I feel that this is a great site for parents school and professors.  It was a very user friendly site.,5
1572,"For a first time user I felt it extremely confusing. In addition some of the links are dead. I can see there is a wealth of information, but getting to it might take too much clicking and download time. I did spend quite a bit of time searching. I cannot say if this site is used appropriatley it would enhance anything, it took to long to navigate around. ",3
1572,"Very informative website. Mental Health Net presents information about personality disorders in a gentle way that does not blame victims of personality disorders for their problems. Instead, this site gives anyone who wishes to know more about personality disorders the opportunity to do so. Disorders are dealt with in the Symtom and Treatment sections where a list of several disorders is given. In the Symtom section each disorder can be clicked on and a page will be displayed that breaks the disorder down into some basic behavioral syptoms and problems associated with the disorder. The Treatment section breaks down into four basic parts which include Psychotherapy, Hospitalization, Medication, and/or Self Help. Each of these different options for treatment of a particular disorder is explained in terms of effectivness, availability, and nesessity depending upon the severity of the disorder. Links to online resources, organizations, and supports groups are also provided so anyone who knows someone with such a disorder can learn more and contact others with simular problems.",4
1572,This site is a good source of information about symptoms of particular disorders. It gives resources for treatments and links to tyoes of rherapy. It is a very general site but has links to many other sites for further information.Technical Remarks: This site is quite easy to follow. Most of the links seem to still be valid. ,3
1573,This site is also excellent for Materials Science and Engineering; espicially courses on Electronic Properties of Materials.Technical Remarks: The site functions very well.,5
1573,"The applets by Wie are all very good, and this is one of the best.  Integrates animation with graphics and text to provide a clear understanding of the semiconductor manufacturing process.",5
1574,"I used this learning material for teaching myself about credit cards and interest rates.  I found it very helpful and took lots of time to go through the entire quiz sections to learn as much as I could.  I think this is a great resource for students and while some of the links for student credit cards may be more focused on selling credit cards, the learning material is very good.",5
1575,"As an example of how technology enables a powerful approach to science teaching, this URL links directly to some of the most respected research on myosins.  The organization of knowledge displayed here about myosins is clearly outlined in a way that is superior to any published textbook.  Such a resource suggests to me that the role of textbooks must change as we come to rely more on Web pages for the status of current knowledge in Biology.Technical Remarks: The gif animation showing movement of myosin along the actin filament takes a few minutes to download using a slow modem - but then the animation takes off and keeps going!  One question remains: Does this animation represent myosin motion in general, or does it, perhaps, display an artifact from the conditions used to create these images.  Such a question should motivate future students to enter the fascinating field of myosin research!!!",5
1576,Part two of three excellent interactive exercises that investigate the concept of speciation. Students are required to draw conclusions from information and data provided. This is a very difficult concept for students. Very well organized and well written.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash player,5
1577,"One of the better Fourier synthesis applets, but it is most frustrating that the small display window is used to show more than 8 fundamental periods of oscillation for the wave.  As a result, the user can't really see the effect of harmonics beyond the first few.  The author should modify the applet to show just one or two fundamental periods.",4
1577,"One of the most useful applets. Highly recommended. Applet works smoothly, and theinterface is well-designed.",5
1578,"This is a good reference site to point you in the right direction for finding information on different genetic conditions. The site is very simple and easy to navigate. It's a good starting point if you would like to find a lot of different resources, on genetics.",4
1579,"Pretty neat site in that it gives you several exercises you can do (ones marked with red boxes) to improve your understanding of french grammar, which is more than a lot of online syllabi do for you! It also gives you links where you can learn more about french culture, geography, etc.",3
1580,"Yea there is a lot of good practice problems for geometry, but it can't get a 5 star because it's not as engaging as it could be. This can be an effective tool if the teacher wants to display different things involving geometry.",4
1581,The museum covers a wide range of topics. Have used for diversity of life assignments and evolution assignments. Reliable and accurate.,5
1582,"A great resource for instructors looking to create an inquiry-based introductory biology lab.  The site contains information and exercises on using 10 different model organisms in the lab and potential research questions for students to answer.  It also contains links to scientists actively using these organisms in their research, to scientific societies and other resources.  This project is supported by the Council on Undergraduate Research and NSF and is a great link for active learning in laboratories.",5
1583," The simulations are well-thought of, but trifle ""dry"".  The presenter is speaking monotonously and a little too fast!",3
1584,"This site, within the Exploratorium's larger site, offers a range of presentations, learning styles, and perspectives for discovering what an eye actually is and how it works.  Audio, visuals, video, and text provide information, steps and viewpoints that will students young and old gain insight about sight.  This site could be used by teachers to help elementary and middle school students really discover information about the eye and enhance what studies may be occurring in the actual classroom.The organization and presentation of this site make it easy to navigate and select the options you wish to research.Technical Remarks: RelPlayer and QuickTime 2.0 or higher for both Macs and PCs is needed to view the eye dissection demonstration.  Acrobat Reader is needed if you wish to download the printable steps and eye information made avaialble at this site.",5
1585,"1.  I have used the materials at Swarthmore's Math Forum many times over the last five years.  I have used them in teaching-learning activities as well as just for ideas.2.  The Web Units & Lessons have been helpful for inservice teachers refreshing their understandings of mathematics they have not studied for many years.  For example, my mathematics methods students used Math to Build On, by Johnny and Margaret Hamilton, to help relearn some concepts in trigonometry.  I would not recommend this as a stand-alone experience.  Explanations needed to accompany the work my students did, but the way the material was presented gave the students a good start.My undergraduate elementary school future teachers enjoyed the tessellation tutorials on the Web Units & Lessons.3.  There is much material on this site from which teachers can select.  When it is used in conjunction with the teacher's own expertise and lesson plans, it can be very effective.  My favorite part of the site is the Math Resources by Subject.I particularly believe that the Math Forum was one of a few sites that really helped launch mathematics educators toward using the Internet for wise and appropriate applications for learning mathematics.  I am thankful to the Math Forum ""founders"" for the service they started and continue to provide.Technical Remarks: First time users will find the Math Forum very easy to use.",4
1585,"The Math Forum is the best site I have discovered for beginning teachers to use in their classrooms. The ""Teachers' Place"" is divided into four sections: primary & secondary, college & university, special interest, and general interest. Under the grade level headings, teachers can locate activities and projects, individual lesson plans, collections of lesson plans, fun sites for kids, and math software, as well as professional development related activities/opportunities for themselves.I teach students who are interested in becoming special education teachers. In my methods courses, I have used many of the lesson plans and activities from this site in order to teach students how to adapt lessons for students with disabilities. There are also two additional sources of gaining additional information built in as part of this site: Ask Dr. Math and Teacher2Teacher. In both situations, I have had students interact with others as they develop and hone their mathematics teaching abilities.",5
1586,This site is full of good information on advertisements and logo use.  I viewed many of the videos and will use this in future classes.Technical Remarks:internet high speed connection,4
1586,I used several of the videos in class and asked for student reaction. Most were very good.The content is excellent for teaching advertising at the high school level (if your kids can handle some swearing).Several of the videos can greatly enhance students understanding of how marketing in the real world works.Technical Remarks: Video links are easy to access and use. A high speed connection is necessary to show in class.,5
1587,"Great photos, used some for my microbiology lectures!!!",4
1587,Excellent site for biology teachers.,4
1587,"Very interesting site, with color photographs (including microscope views) of fungi. The ""Fungus of the Month"" features information about one species, presented in an informative, and often amusing way. Students really like it, and learn a lot about fungi (usually not one of their favorite subjects). Technical Remarks: There is an extensive collection of photos, that can be accessed by phylum etc.One drawback is that there is no easy way to search for information on one particular fungus that has been featured in the ""Fungus of the Month"".",4
1588,THE LINK IS DEAD.,5
1589,This material provides a solid background for understanding the issues surrounding how and why adults learn.  The series of informational videos cover a variety theories realted to adult learning nd lifespan development. They make a good distinction between adragogy and pedagogy. It could certainly be used to build a solid foundation for both new and old teachers of adult students.,4
1590,An impressive collection.  I clicked through a significant number of links and can definitely see the utility of these sites in (and out of) the classroom for informal learning.  Drawback: Found the interface to be so overloaded with advertisements that it can be difficult to ascertain whether the site is a legitimate collection of learning sites or not.  I would say this is the only weakness of the site.Technical Remarks:All sites appeared to be currently working/updated.  I didn't find any broken links.,4
1591,Outstanding collection of American history artifacts.Technical Remarks:Easily searchable. Well indexed.,4
1591,"I was especially impressed with the September 11 collection that gives an opportunity to a teacher to use different media files (audio, video, pictures, texts...) The material could be used in any language to prompt student's to suppor their opinion and/or discuss on a topic. In that case, the audio file could be used as a lead in for a lesson, for students to get familiar with the task. Audio file could also be used as a follow up ctivity,after exhausting all the other (reading, pictures...) materials given on the topic and thus giving students the opportunity to discuss, compare, criticize in the target language. The site an endless resource of ideas and I wish it had more audio files in languages other than English that could be used as authentic material for teaching history and culture as well.Technical Remarks:The files are easily accessible and classified in different categories by: title, subject, audio, photography, video and written narrative. This gives you an opportunity to find almost anything very easily and to fnd similar files on the same topic/area. Audio and video files are in 3 formats so there is virtually no possibility not to be able to open the file.",5
1592,This site has an enormous collection of beautiful photographs taken of various Californian flora and fauna.  It is very user-friendly allowing for browsing or direct search.,5
1593,Part three of three excellent interactive exercises that investigate the concept of signal transduction. Students are required to draw conclusions from information and data provided. Uses human disorders to illustrtae concept. This is a very difficult concept for students. Very well organized and well written. Have used in class successfully.Technical Remarks:Requires Flash player,5
1595,This is a great site with an extensive collection of plant images.  Very reputable source (Noble Foundation) and well-done!,5
1596,Such a great video!! Love the sound effects,5
1596,A clear animation of the events in the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Helps students see this as a continuous process rather than a series of names.,5
1597,"Colorful presentataion of very basic concepts.  But it still came up in the beautiful Norwegian, not dubbed in English but subtitled in English, with quite a bit of final dialogue also in English.  For undergraduate classes perhaps this would be too difficult to enjoy and not detailed enough to help students know more than that they may fail if they cheat and may do well if they rely on their own ideas.",5
1598,Thanks for compiling and sharing these resourcsws. ,5
1599,"The accuracy is decent, but there is a wide variety of similar material out there that is now more in depth and more detailed.",2
1599,To small and fast to read the information.  Would be very hard to teach with in my opinion. Would like to see it larger and with real type text and slowed down or a frame-by-frame addition,2
1600,"This interactive online tutorial explains plagiarism and its consequences, and provides ways to avoid plagiarism. The tutorial uses videos and quizes with feedback to increase learner feedback. The tutorial links to University of Texas Libraries related websites, and provides instructor tools to enable to download the test package. At least one link is faulty. The site is a bit limited, but can serve as a quick intro.",3
1601,"This article was found when conducting research on the net for my MBA MGMT class. Was one of the first few links off of a google search.Excellent article on ""Strategic Human Resource Management"" in a global business environment. Focus is primarily on effectively managing people in multi-national and transnational firms. Very easy read and great reference material for a student.",4
1602,"This is a great resource, and a valid premise. I think that implementing more hands on is crucial at every stage of education.",4
1602,"It is a very nice demonstration of a hands-on activity; students learn while they are enjoying the experience. This experience is very convenient for high school students. Concerning the way they present the information to us; It is a short video, easy to follow and with high quality.",4
1602,"As related to the classroom, this short video describes the effectiveness of project-based, hands-on learning.  I think this is extremely necessary in today's science classrooms.",5
1603,"I include some experiences in Second Life in my graduate courses so educators are aware of virtual learning possibilities. This clip offers a thoughtful overview with key terminology in concise and informative manner. Because it is a clip, I can actually link to it with my course material so students can refer back to the information as needed.",4
1604,Good resource for lab use,4
1605,This is no longer available from the referring source.,1
1606,"I spent an hour going through the material. Dr. Arsham explains in detail, the need for making good strategic decisions which is what Management Science is all about. He discusses OR/MS/DS modelling process and how it can be an effective tool for solving/improving problems in an organization.  He also includes the historical basis for the study of Management Science.  This site provides good information on quantitative analysis and would be useful for students in Business Management and Marketing.",5
1607,This site a great way to bring books to life by promoting a Skype visit to the classroom by the author.  The site offers a list of authors who would be wiling to participate in a free Skype visit after the classroom/group has read a book written by that author.  This is available to classes from preschool to adults.  ,5
1607,This site offers a great way to bring literacy back into the classroom by using technology and saving money.Technical Remarks:Designed well and information can be found easily.,5
1608,This is good basic information about auxin as a plant growth regulator.,5
1609,"I feel that this module is very good, which will definitely help learners improve their Chinese listening comprehension. This module features authentic listening materials. The video, which helps learners better understand the lesson, is also integrated into the audio very appropriately, given that it does not present an interference to learners' listening. In addition, through this module learners can learn traditional Chinese characters.Technical Remarks:This module is easy to navigate. I can easily move to the next lesson and go back to the previous lesson and so on. However, if the author presents a link that allows the learner to directly go to different lessons, instead of having to click the ""back"" button again and again, it will be much more helpful.",4
1610,This website would be aa good laboratory review for a one-semester A&P course.  The review is very good for the auditory learners.  I would suggest that some of the muscles and other structures discussed need to be labeled to better assist the first year or the General Education students.Technical Remarks:No problems the site worked seamlessly.  On several occasions it appeared that the discussion was cut short.,4
1611,"You need to purchase their book to get the cases so you know what they are talking about.  The book is only about 14 dollars, but this is useless without it.",3
1612,"There are a wide variety of materials available.  Some of the information is much less useful.  The first hand accounts presented in the first ""section"" are the most valuable resources.  The site has too many ads that are often distracting.",4
1613,"This is a great free alternative tool that allows for brainstorming, mind-mapping and other tools that can be useful in K-20 classrooms.  It can be used in a class discussion,as an assessment tool, and in committee meetings :)",4
1614,"The videos did not load for each of the segments. The one video that did load was reviewing a leadership outcome. I think an outcome related to a core subject might provide better direction. Also, the rubric examples were very subjective and not very explanatory for the student or instructor on what is expected at each level to earn the points displayed.",2
1615,"Professionaly-developed site, with great graphics and clear explanations.  The applets are very helpful and well done.",5
1616,"This is a very informative site, especially for students wanting general information about a discipline they may not be currently studying. It could be helpful as an enhancment to the area of study, but the site is somewhat limited.Technical Remarks: Some of the links providing further research ans study do not work or are not updated. The site is very easy to navigate, yet some information is incomplete.",3
1617,"This site enables one to evaluate and compare assistive technology products. The sites database of products and research (TechMatrix) is searchable by sujbect, grade level, disability, and key word. The site also has a planning guide for integrating technology, and describes models of good practice. ",4
1618,"A very good collection of Chinese poems. It provides both simplified and traditional character versions for visitors to choose. It also provides Hanyu Pinyin including the tones. In addition, it provides nice English translations (some poems even have more than one version).Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate.",5

1619,"This site is very interesting. It is small, but the tidbits of facts are fascinating. It is quite intrigueing to find out what event in the history of psychology may have occurred on your very own birthday. I only spent a short time at this site, about 15 minutes. Much can be learned about differnet historical events. Technical Remarks: This site is very easy to use, it is self explanitory. Since it is somewhat small it requires little more than picking a date.",4
1619,"This site is an excellent research site. It's easy to use, and offers information on so many topics. ",5
1619,"This is a great site. It was an enormous amount of information. Anyone who is interested in the field of psychology will benefit from acessing this site. I liked knowing the history behind some of the pyschologists that I have learned about in the classroom and through the textbooks. This is a place for stdents and well as teachers.I will add it to my favorites list. Technical Remarks: I spent about an hour here, but you could spend so much more time learning about the history of pyschology. I really like the way the site is broken down into different time periods. The site is well laid out and very easy to use.I don't think that anyone would have a problem using this site.",5
1619,This is a great site to learn about the pioneers in psychology.  This would also be a good site if you were researching the early days in psychology.Technical Remarks: This was an easy site to navigate.,5
1619,"What a find!  I found this website to be extremely informative.  I spent several hours exploring this website and am planning to revisit this website on a regular basis to explore more of its many offerings.  The quality of the content was of a high level and was quite credible.  Specifically, I had the opportunity to explore an in depth article came up on the origins of cognitive thought by B.F. Skinner.  Technical Remarks: In my opinion, this website was very user friendly and I had no immediate problems accessing any of the information that I wished to.  The overall organization and setup of the website was pleasing as well.",5
1620,"I have used this site successfully with several of my classes to practice the weather and to compare the weather in the different continents. The weather vocabulary can be combined to review the capitals of countries, and to teach comparisons.  If two or more students work together at one site, or if you have a computer lab setup to have speakers at different lab stations team up to converse, this activity can become quite interactive.  ",3
1621,Thanks for providing the documents for this module. ,5
1622,"This is a remarkable site, expressed in first person with streaming audio and video by the individual whose stories and experiences are related here. It is applicable to disciplines beyond History and allows you to experience ethicality, diversity, emotions, and raw honesty.Technical Remarks: The artistic enhancements subtlely support the military background and feeling of the chaos of war. It is easy to navigate if you know to click on pictures and phrases. A back button on each page would facilitate returning to each country. It would be wonderful to click on the 40's small photos and enlarge them by doing so.",5
1623,"a. I found that this material covers the complete topics and basics comparing with the other Algebra textbook I used before.  
b. It widely and accurately covers the basics we need since it contains all topics at this level.  
c. If used appropriately, learning will be enhanced since it should cover all the basics needed for the first level of college Algebra learning.  
d. It is easy to use since it's easy to find the topics and the concepts we need to learn or refresh.Technical Remarks:It is organized in good shape, and we can locate topics and contents in good sequence.",4
1624,This is a fantastic resource!  I teach web design and this can definitely be used in my course.  One criticism is the fact that the button does not appear to work on the last exercise (experiment with color).,4
1624,"Very good, thank you!",5
1624,This tutorial discusses color on Web pages and provides explains use of the hexadecimal system to identify color. It takes about ten minutes to go through.  The material is valid; the presentation is attractive and interesting.  It is presented in short chunks with optional interactive elements for which immediate feedback is available.Technical Remarks: The site worked for me.   No additional technology was needed. ,5
1625,This is actually a perfect reference point for any discussion on comets. It should work good as it corrects the many incorrect assumptions about them!,5
1626,"How you reviewed the materials: The calculator was demonstrated for us in class once, and I also used it personally.The quality of content: It was very helpful in relating the effect of different input to the output. It helped me to pick up on the relations of the properties. By using different input and raising and lowering them, I was able to relate them more easily and understand that, e.g. ""if I take this pressure ratio up, the mach numbers get closer together.""The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning: I think it was very helpful when used in the classroom, and can be utilized that way in almost any class working with aerodynamics.The ease of using the materials:This was the only problem I had with the applet. Though inputting numbers was easy, I felt the output could have been better labeled so that it was easier to figure out what all of the numbers and ratios referred to. As someone who isn't real familiar with aerodynamics, and had only used the application once in class before I tested it myself, initially I couldn't remember what it all stood for.",4
1626,How you reviewed the materials     I was introduced to the website in the classroom as a teaching aide.  The instructor used it to help the student be able to visualize the immense heat needed in a jet engine to propel the rocket.Quality of content     The applet is very helpful for the student that is not a rocket scientist.  The applet takes all of the guess work out of finding some temperatures and pressures.  It is rather helpful and in the manner used to present the material to the class it was very helpful in my visualizing the effects of the Mach number and the temperature. Potential effectiveness for enhanced teaching and learning      This applet has the potential ability to be very effective in the academic setting.  When introduced in my classroom it helped to connect the dots and made it much easier for the student to visualize the effects of a sonic boom as well as the immense temperature needed to propel a rocket into outer space.  I can only imagine how helpful this applet would be if I were working in the field of gas dynamics.  Ease of using     The applet is very easy to use.  The user just needs to enter the input data and hit calculate.  The applet could not be any more strait forward.,5
1626,"Calculates various physical properties of compressible fluids for specific input. Not intuitive at all, but for those that regularly work in this field this could be a time-saving applet. Of limited use to anyone else.",2
1627,"I have the impression that this is meant for teacher led practice.  However, it does not grab the students' attention.  I find that a piece of colored paper or paper plate work great as a model.  I was also disappointed to find that the teacher had to buy a subscription to use the tool.",3
1628,"This review was created in March 27, 2017.
Culture Unplugged is an aggregator of documentary films. The films range from 1987 to at least 2014. “cultureunplugged.com presents short length + feature length documentary / film content from independent film-makers and grassroot productions to a global audience ....""
The site includes a number of aspirational statements: “Culture Unplugged’ ... is a mission, a vision and an aspiration to facilitate integration of disparate parts of the self ....""
The site chooses films through a “festival selection process.” Reviewers are based in Mountain View CA, and Pune, Maharashtra, India.
A click on “NOW” brings up a link to an Al Jazeera documentary newsletter. It features reports from Inter Press Service and video from Al Jazeera. The site is broadly committed to “social change.” It includes disparate voices and points-of-view without a commitment to a specific ideology. From a pedagogical perspective, this is an advantage. 
Content is searchable by broad headings including
Human Life Human CommunityHuman Exploration
The topics are necessarily broad with some overlap. It’s not obvious why “Farming & Food” is part of Human Exploration while “Food, Water and Livelihood” is under Human Life and Sustainability & Simplicity are listed under Human Community.
There is an open ended “Search” function. Looking for “coal in the United States” returns relevant hits as well as ""The Beekeepers."" If the search returns “no results” a list of “what the audience is watching now” appears.
Filmmakers are identified as “Story.Tellers.” The site claims that there are contributors from 150 countries –– an unusually diverse group of makers. Contributors are not listed by country. There is a photo collage of about 120 images. Clicking and then mousing over an image reveals a snapshot summary of a film and its maker. Contributors appear to range from first-time filmmakers to major producers like ARTE (France) and CARE.
Films range from feature length productions to a few minutes. Thumbnail images are accompanied with a brief synopsis and data describing the country of origin, director, year of production etc. The films are in English or subtitled in English. The films stream full screen. There are no closed captions. There is no opportunity for user reviews or comments, except checking boxes such as “Incredible,” Informative,” Humorous,” etc. The quality of the streaming varies from very good to pixilated. Films range from professional productions with high production values to amateur “films of the heart.”
This site has a global reach, making little known films freely available. It addresses contemporary issues and pressing concerns. It offers faculty and students “infinite choices.” This is both its strength and its greatest weakness.
It’s my impression that this library of materials would serve as valuable research tool to determine what kinds of films exist on a given topic. It would be less valuable for students of documentary production, seeking out exemplars of outstanding documentary practice and technique. I would offer this as a supplementary resource for documentary students. The site may be of even greater value to teachers and students in a wide variety of disciplines especially in the social sciences, as well as students of environmental science, ecology, women’s studies, queer studies, communication, religious studies, health etc.",3

1629,"I've used Diigo with multiple courses over the past three years, and I've found it a wonderful resource for student learning! I've introduced Diigo as an optional tool for students organizing the plethora of web resources shared in one graduate class only to have several students say that Diigo was the tool that they would be continuing to use after the course is over. I've also prescribed use of Diigo for both required and extra credit ""annotated web bibliography"" assignments. Students are amazed by the power of leaving a course with access to 10+ unique annotated web resources from every student in class! (The ability to establish a group and delineate a ""tag dictionary"" as a starting point is extremely helpful!) I have not formally used the highlighting or ""stickies"" features with students, but these clearly have great potential as well.Technical Remarks:Browser toolbar integration is one of Diigo's most useful features, but some browsers are better integrated than others. The developers appear to be working to keep up despite disparate code bases, though.",5
1630,"Edmodo is a great free alternative for teachers, schools and districts who do not have the resources to host and administer their own Learning Management System. Edmodo provides a way for teachers and students to extend their teaching and learning activities outside of the classroom.
 
With the communication tools in the system, students can work together on projects remotely. The storage capacity of the system allows teachers to store materials online for student access. Teachers can post assignments and grades, and quizzes can be given. Teachers have the option for form multiple groups for different classes. There are optional apps which can be integrated into Edmodo groups. Some of these apps are free while others must be purchased. There is also an event planner for groups. and an option to allow parental access to groups.
 
There is a premium version of Edmodo available for those who wish to upgrade.",5
1631,"good site, but not how we teach nursing process",4
1632,This applet is useful because it shows solutions to the Schroedinger equation for noneigenvalues of the energy.,5

1634,"Wow, this is a great site to use as a resource for information on China's ethnic peoples. It is well organized and a pretty simple navigation system, though there is a world of information.",4
1634,Great initiative! Nice layout and resources for an overview of all Chinese ethnic groups.Technical Remarks:Pictures and videos add lots of flavor to the site.,5
1635,This site's output immediately became a part of my own website. It was easy to generate and even easy to create a special style for the output! It certainly does help teachers who can't write their own javascript to incorporate relevant rss feeds into their own websites so that students can go exploring with the help of their teacher.Technical Remarks:Many of the sites that this site says are using Feed2JS are no longer functioning. They might want to check into that.,5
1635,This tool is an incredible resource for any instructor to use for posting syndicated content into online courses.,5
1636,"This is a resource to teach students about the four stroke cycle, also called the Otto Cycle. There are two parts of this resource, both of which are useful. The first part is a web page explaining the history of the Otto Cycle, the parts of the engine, and the four strokes of the Otto Cycle. This page does a good job explaining the strokes and is easy to understand even for someone not previously familiar with the cycle. The page also has a bar at several points throughout the page that lets the user jump to whichever section they want quickly rather than scrolling up or down the page.

The second part to this resource is a visual simulation of how the Otto Cycle works using both a visualization of a piston and a pressure-volume diagram. Once the user starts the process, the piston moves up and down while there is a point on the diagram that moves along the process path of the cycle. The name of each step is displayed as it is being performed and the key points of the cycle are also labeled on the diagram. The site with the visualization is a German site, however, and although the text is still in English, occasionally it will switch to German causing the user to reload the page if they wish to read the text.

Overall, this is a very good resource both for beginning students as well as more experienced ones. The web page provides easy-to-understand, useful information and the visualization is a great representation of the Otto Cycle. This can be used either to introduce students to the Otto Cycle or to give them a better understanding of it. Highly Recommended.",5
1636,How you reviewed the materials:I skimmed through the tutorial and then ran through several simulations of the cycle.The quality of content:I liked the synchronized side by side p-V diagram and piston cyclinder apparatus. It helped to see how each part of the cycle related to the system.The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning:I think it could be effectively used to help anyone who is working with analyzing the four stroke cycle.The ease of using the materials:Very easy to use and didn't require any previous knowledge of the system. It could be learned from the tutorial and then explained via the application.,5
1637,"The site was very user friendly. No difficulty experienced in getting to the point of the assignment, The material was also quite relevant and I have already used it in my classroom.There were no technical issues. It is noteworthy that the format of this material places the onus on the student to select an appropriate movie, evaluate it and report back to classmates. This approach fosters student engagement.",4
1638,"I have not used this in a classroom, but certainly  would. This site provides some good background and a nice overview to the gun debate. It would provide a good background for dicussion in a classroom.",4
1639,Go out to Fort Irwin and check out the Deep Space Network Dishes. It'll blow your mind.,5
1640,"I like the way this material is presented.  Plus there are many formats such as animation, video, power point and more to choose from.  I like the pictures, the color and all of it!",5
1641,"This is great learning tool for all students.  It is a fun way to review for a test and it gets all students involved. I have used a variety of games for learning, and students just love them.",4
1641,"This site gives a wide variety of games/activities that are useful for review prior to testing or just to check for general understanding. I have used jig-sawing, jeopardy, pictionary, who wants to be a millionaire, hand-man, and a couple others.  These activities are well organized, easy to follow and implement in the classroom. Technical Remarks: The visuals and instructions are clear and the site is easy to motivate.",5
1642,I really found this a fun tool to inspire new search strategies with google.  Lots of ah-ha moments.  I think even my LIS graduate students would think this is fun and an engaging visualization.,5
1643,I love this applet because it has instructions for adapting it to any data set. Students can take data sets from class discussion and worksheets and manipulate the bin widths of a histogram. It is a great visual tool.Technical Remarks:No difficulties. The applet is very simple and easy to use.,4
1644,An excellent graphic on the molecular and cellular basis of cancers.,4
1645,"This is a good site on the human heart. There is information on the structure of the human heart and how it works. There are also animated tutorials that show how the blood pumps blood through the heart and sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle. These tutorials are very detailed and are a good supplement to the description of the hearts antimony and physiology that the site offers. In addition to information on the function and anatomy of the heart, there is also information on disorders and diseases of the heart. The information that this site contains is very precise and detailed.",5
1646,"An amazing site for learning environments, facilitators, instructors, administrators and students as well. The resources provided in this site are valuable, demonstrating drawing together pertinent practices from numerous universities. Helps to save the time that would be spent on google searches.

1650,"A comprehensive tutorial on basic concepts in computer engineering. The site is interactive with an audio component to it. I have used this tutorial site in my online Digital Design course.It covers, Boolean Algebra, Logic Gates, MUX/DMUX, Encoder/Decoder, 2,3,4,5, and 6 variable Karnaugh Maps.Technical Remarks:Before using this site, Macromedia Flash Player should be downloaded.",5
1651,Great format and a second layer follow-up to Utilizing Effective Instructional Technology. The underlying philosophy of engaging student in an online environment is imperative to transfer learning.,4
1652,"I use Twitter in several classes and always find myself explaining the basics to a handful of students.  This will be a great lesson that can be modified to fit varying needs.Technical Remarks:I'm glad to see this was updated recently.  Goven how fast social media can change, anything related to Twitter or other mediums will need to be updated frequently to remain current.",4
1653,"This is an excellent resource for anyone especially along the lines of lawyers. The information is detailed and handy for criminal justice classes or for any such professional field. At worst it is a great place for anyone to learn more about court cases and forensics. It's like a front seat ride in the mind of the professionals.Technical Remarks: Very easy to navigate, all you need is on one front page that clicks onto several sub categories of interet. one of the easier more informative sites I've been on.",5
1653,"I spent approximately 45 minutes browsing this website, although could have easily spent more time.  I found that the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant.  Many students, not just psychology students, would find this website very informative.  Teaching faculty could certainly use this website for topics of discussion.Technical Remarks: As a first time user, I found this website very easy to navigate through.  Other first time users should have no trouble at all.",5
1654,"1) I spent about 15 minutes trying to get to the test, I gave up2)The quality was poor,no link to the test or main section of the web page3) Little if any learing or teaching use here4)not user friendly at allTechnical Remarks: very limited and not technical at all-needs work",2
1654,"My Assessment in the Curriculum students actually used the Keirsey Temperment Sorter in an Internet-delivered lesson.  The instrument provides an experientialbasis for students to ""understand"" instruments designed to provide information about personality (in this case, character and temperament).  The students enjoyed the class exercise.  They also learned about ""tests and measurement"" from completing the questionnaire.I am adding another comment (Feb 4, 2001), based on a Distance-Learning Seminar I just attended.  The participants in the College of Health and College of Business, said they use this instrument in their (highly Internet-based) lessons.  One instructor uses this online form for helping students learn about project management (and in the process of forming teams for the course).  The health college teacher uses this in an assessment course. Technical Remarks: First-time users have no problem with completing the questionnaire.  Nor did they experience any problems with their online electronic inputs to me regardingthe results/uses of the Keirsey instrument.",3
1654,"This is an interesting site, but I did not agree with my identified temperment type.",3
1654,"Similar to many scales,it reads like astrology. Provids only positive models which while true don't provide extensive useful correlates. Technical Remarks: Scales are based on comparitive rankings and either/or bivariate choices. Newer scales are based on continuous if not linear bases so you can select on a line between two values. ",2
1654,The Keirsey Temperment Sorter II is an online questionnaire that contains 70 items. Students complete the questionnaire and immediately receive a profile that provides a rough indicator of their temperment. Numerous interpretations of temperment indicators are available at this site for students to use to interpret the results of their questionnaire responses.Technical Remarks:Easy to use!,4
1655,"The first time I watched this it made it seem more confusing than it actually is, but after a couple times I began to see it's benefit.",3
1655,"This is great.  I will not just use this in my classroom, but also at home to teach my son.  A great simplification to an otherwise complex lesson.",5
1655,A very thorough picture of what occurs during the Krebs cycle.  Includes a written description of each step and an energy meter for each step of the process.,4
1656,"This site has a minimal number of historical cases listed.  It summarizes the primary issue of the cases too briefly.  It has a section on teaching strategy which could be useful for a first time teacher of the material, but offers nothing for more advanced teachers in search of new was of presenting the material.",2
1657,"This is really a good resource material for me. My colleague mentioned this to me last year. I tried it but I really need more time to figure out how to work it out. I am used to Geometer's Sketchpad but some of my students could not afford to buy it and my school don't have a budget for it. The good thing about GeoGebra is that it is free. You have the video on how to use it which is great and activities that I can use in the future.Technical Remarks:Maybe a background music can help or an option to include background music. Most of my students are inclined to music, adding background music might helped them think deeper.",4
1658,"I will be giving a presentation about learning styles at an upcoming instructional technology institute.  During the activity session, I will have the participants visit your site and take the learning styles inventory.  My hope is that the participants will use this resource with their students.Although the inventory is short, it does provide useful insights about learning preferences.<",4
1658,"I teach an online study skills class. One of the unitsis about personality and learning styles and how astudent can best take advantage of his/her own uniqueapproach to education.  I would use this site very nearthe beginning of the assignment so that students couldbecome intrigued with what these kinds of tests couldshow them about themselves. The site has six differentkinds of learning styles and intelligence tests as wellas suggestions about what to do about your particularresults. I will use this object next semester.1)The site was easy to navigate. Students just click onone of the six boxes, take an inventory and submit theiranswers. They immediately get a read out of what theirscores mean. I think they would love to have this kindof information. Everyone loves taking those little teststhat tell us about ourselves!Taking these tests wouldgive student a great deal of insight into how peoplediffer in their approaches to learning.2) After visiting these sites student be aware thatthere are different styles of learning and that alllearners are  not alike. They will also know that thereare resources onlline where a student may go for help inlearning how to deal with his/her particular style.3)My learners are usually first semester collegestudents who are not prepared or motivated to move intoa program or plan.

1665,Good sources that are very useful in the classroom.  Easy to refer students to this site for a good review.  Ideal for an Introduction class.Technical Remarks:Internet access.,4
1666,The students reallly enjoy following Merche through Spain and the interactive lessons really keep them engaged.,5
1667,"This site is designed to create and share materials to support students who are learning to use the Biology Workbench for Bioinformatics data analysis.  So far, the text-based tutorials function somewhat like the user's manual that so many of us choose to ignore.  Some of the examples show the instructor doing the thinking, with the risk that a student would learn to mimic how the instructor thinks.  That is not how creative science proceeds.  This project is a good attempt at making the tools of inquiry available to students, and my view is that this should be used as an opportunity to those who have found a successful approach to introduce bioinformatics tools to students to join this project to share resources.",2
1668,"This is a fun site to use for younger students, who enjoy the interactive nature of the tasks/games.",4
1669,"This organization's mission is to promote freedom of thought, inquiry and expression and oppose censorship in all its forms.

1671,"The article was great from 10,000 feet.  However, I think a beginner could get a little distracted with all the grammatical errors presented on the site.  I feel these same errors may cause the article to lose some credibility.Aside from that though, I think the graphics were well placed, and the links to other topics was very helpful as a refresher.Technical Remarks: Technically, I thought the article was general enough for a beginner, and a good refresher for the novice.  ",4
1671,Excellent site with graphics and definitions. Clear and well organized. Easy to navigate. Can be used for all levels of networking courses.,5
1671,"Good website! The nice graphics, format and navigation can help people to better understand. It took me 20 minute to read.

I specifically like the definition summary in Internet Protocols and the graphics in Token Ring LANs.  ",4
1671,"Good graphics and presentation format. Material was easy to review and navigate.  Approximately 15 minutes was spent reviewing content.Technical Remarks: Material is sufficient as a very top level overview of networking and some of the components involved with networking. It would not be adequate for any type of detailed discussion (e.g. pro/con, why would you select a switch vs a hub vs a repeater).  ",3
1671,"Clever use of animation to guide the student through a relatively complex networking operation.  The various pieces of equipment are given ""personalities"" that capture the student's attention, and there's a nice sense of humor to the tutorial.Technical Remarks:The ""sniffing"" exercise doesn't work properly in IE 9.",4
1671,"I like the article. It introduces the general concept and basic components of networks to beginners through an email example. The whole article uses an email example as thread to demonstrate how a computer attached to internet sends a message to another computer on a remote side through LAN-WAN-LAN with many components on them. I am a student who is taking the course !?Networking!?. We have almost learned all the concept, components and working mechanism introduced in the article. In fact, I take the article as a test to see how much I mastered what I have learned from the course !?Networking!?. Reading the article helps me reviews the basic concept and components and further impresses the understanding to the networking technology.  Technical Remarks: Just like its name implied, the article only simply introduces the basic concept of networking. It does not discuss deeply any technical processing details of networking.   ",4
1671,"A good overview of a lot of the hardware and terminology used, but a little light on specifics.  There was not a lot of continuity between the pages, although links to related topics were provided.  Easy to use and navigate. I like the look and layout of the pages-- not too busy, and self contained, only addressing a limited amount of information per page.  Technical Remarks: A summary page would be helpful-- i.e., what is the purpose of this presentation?  Who's the audience?  I hope this isn't part of a commercial presentation-- there are way too many spelling and grammatical errors (buad, discared, As it's name implies, etc.) ",3
1671,"I spent about 10 minutes reviewing the material.  The quality of the simple, straight-forward definitions of some fairly technical concepts is very good.  The topics covered are those any beginning network student needs to know and will encounter.This is material that beginners will be able to understand and use.  Other sources often cover these topics with technical jargon that beginners might struggle with.The material is easy to use and does a good job of providing links to terms used to define some of the topics.  Technical Remarks: Good use of graphics to illustrate things such as firewalls, hubs and gateways.",5
1672,Nice Job! Helps learners to be able to use visionalization and word association in memorization and retention. Able to pull up easy from net. Did not use in classroom yet.,4

1673,"We discussed the different numerical integration methods in the class and then went over the Wiley Numerical Integration web-site in class.  I asked my students to explore this web-site and write a short report about the web-site.This website gives a very good illustration of all the five numerical integration methods. Most of the integration and differentiation calculations can be done with graphing calculators.   It is not easy to teach the comparison of different numerical integration methods using various examples.  One can easily go through several illustrations by using this web-site. The website also covers Newton's Method and Intermediate Theorem.   My students found the Numerical Integration section most useful.Technical Remarks:It is a pretty easy to use web-site. All one has to do is to enter any function, specify the number of partitions and the numerical integraion method. The numerical anwsers for all five methodsappear on the screen with a highlighted answer for the particular method.",4
1674,I have added this to my class. I think many college teachers have no background in educational theory and this chart will put it all together.,5

1677,"There are many different activities/labs to peruse here. There is enough stuff here to build a very lab centered unit on photosynthesis and respiration. Using worksheets on the material may be good for starters, but observing these process first hand is more interesting in my opinion.",4
1678,"Overall, this is a good workbook. One of the resources it mentions, Wikipedia's list of plagiarism incidents, appears to have been taken down since it was created, so you might have to update it a bit before using it.
Although it does a good job of describing the shades of gray involved in defining plagiarism, it is awfully long, so you might want to only use portions of it, or assign it as homework or classwork over several class periods.

1681,"This is a one page site that explains the principle of polymerase chain reaction.  This site can be downloaded in pdf format. There is also a link to an animation of the process, which should help students better understand what is occuring.

1683,a. How did you review the materials? I spent about half an hour looking around the site at the differnet quizes then I decided to take the Anxiety Quiz. b. The quality of the content. This site could be used to help engage students in the topics. It is a lot of fun but not very informational.c. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning. This site would make learning really fun for students and I think that teachers would enjoy teaching these things. However it is not a really infomration site. It is a lot of fun though.Technical Remarks: d. The ease of using materials. I found the site very easy to use and it was my first time at it.,4
1683,"I spent about an hour on this site and it was pretty interesting about the personality test.  I never finished the IQ test b/c it took too ling but someday i will go back and do it again.  There was a lot of pretty good information on the site and yes, you could learn a lot and get some research from it.  Technical Remarks: I was a first time user and I thought it was pretty easy to get around.  At first i didn't click on the + sign and I couldn't find what I was supposed to find and then I went back and clicked on the + and from then on I was OK.  I think that other forst time users will be Ok and have an easy time getting around.  ",5
1683,"I really liked this website, I feel that it was interesting and fun to see what kind of results you get.  Technical Remarks: Very easy to use.  ",4
1683,I find sites like these to be much more interesting and able to hold my attention much longer than a simple text site. ,4
1683,I spent about 30 minutes taking some of the tests in this site.  It is very interesting and a lot of fun.  It is exciting to find out the results of the tests and it helps you to learn about yourself.  Technical Remarks: It is very easy to navigate yourself around this site. ,4
1683,"This is a great interactive site where you can take all sorts of tests in different subjects such as ""depression"", ""health"", ""relationships"". I found the information very interesting. I will return to the site and spend more time here.Technical Remarks: This site is easy to access and use. The information is well organized and laid out.",4
1684,"This is an excellent resource for in-class guided conversation practice as well as self-study. The quizzes provide students with instant feedback, allowing them to target areas of language study. The variety of exercises is incredible and vast and provides a great glimpse of American culture as well as valuable language instruction lessons. 
The only negative I see is that that site is quite busy. Non-native speakers may struggle with navigating the site on their own. There are lots of links that would take you away from the exercises.",4
1685,"Pocket (formally Read it Later) rebranded itself as a digital pocket. You can throw articles and videos you want to remember, tag, or read/watch later. This is a great tool to store articles or links you don't have time to read right away. In my workflow this is handy when saving links from Twitter or Google+, or other apps I use to discover (Flipboard, Feedly, Google Reader). Then, when I have time, I can go back to read them. Unfortunately, my pocket ends up being a wonderful storage place because I never have time to read everything! In recent updates Pocket enabled offline reading. I appreciate the tags, stars, and ability to archive (and search). I typically use Pocket's Mac app, iOS, and the Chrome widget for saving an article. Wonderful tool that aids in research and learning presented in a distraction-free environment.Technical Remarks:On the iOS app there isn't an easy way to tag an article when you are in the view mode. You have to back out and then swipe to bring up the tag feature. Pocket works with over 300 apps for capturing content and is viewable online, iOS, Android, and OS X.",4
1686,the applet is neat but more info a/b rolling without slipping would further drive the point home. kmorgan,3
1686,"Good way of illustrating angular and linear velocity.Technical Remarks: Controls tend to leap about a bit, which becomes inconvenient at times.",4
1686,"Although some of the controls are a little jerky, this applet does a good job of demonstrating the relationship between linear and angular speed.  Trying to set the coefficient of friction equal to 0 causes some problems, however.  And it would be nice to have the radius user-defined.",4

1691,Great website!! I intend to use it in my medical microbiology class and my genetics class this fall. It was fun and informative. I’m also glad you incorporated modern tools into the lab even though they were in the future. Great job. I also looked at your CSI lab and it looks like a lot of fun as well. Thanks for making a dry subject fun and interactive!!!Technical Remarks:none,5
1692,"I found this to be a beneficial tool for teaching students about sonata allegro form.  As a visual learner it helped me to be able to “see” where each of the sections of the song begins.  By highlighting the sections as it goes along, students who are weak at reading notation were able to follow along even if they had trouble processing the notes as quick as the song’s tempo.  The ability to pause and point to the sections on the computer display was quite beneficial to class discussions. Technical Remarks:It would have been beneficial to have a fast forward or rewind option.  It would have been helpful to be able to repeat a section that was causing trouble for students.  Also, it would have been useful to be able to skip ahead to a certain measure number or at the least to jump to the next section so students would be able to hear different sections independently.",4
1692,"This visual aid is a helpful tool in introducing the concept of Sonata Form.  Users can see the progression of the form visually (via colorful bars that move with the music and a basic diagram at the bottom of the screen) even as they hear the piece unfold aurally.  It is clear enough for students to access individually; however, I would suggest incorporating the page in a classroom situation to encourage more specific engagement with the form.  Although there are some aspects of the presentation that may be lacking (no use of harmonic relationships via Roman numerals, for example), this provides the opportunity to encourage user participation.  Students could be asked to supply cadential information or chord relationships based on what they hear and see already.Technical Remarks:As was mentioned in the peer review, it is difficult to maneuver through the page at times as the mouse points are small and tricky to find.  Also, the quality of the score is fuzzy when projected on a large screen.",4

1696,This site by Glencoe McGraw Hill provides several good simple exercises for the classroom. Specifically the activities related to developing the skills of observation and reflection are very valuable.The only difficulty with the site is that there are no grade level recommendations.Technical Remarks: All of the worksheets are in PDF format.,4
1696,"This site is found within Glencoe McGraw Hill's main web site.  It is located under the secondary art information and features 12 online art activities that are outcome-based.  The online activities feature internet sites from around the world and are age appropriate for middle and high school students.  The activities here are very good!  Each activity has a worksheet that can be printed out with Acrobat Reader and used by students in their online discovery and learning. I use this site with the student teachers that I instruct so that they can start realizing the difference between an activity and a lesson.  I want my student teachers to know how to take this information and customize it into a good lesson for their individual teaching situations.  Middle school and High school art teachers and those teachers who use interdisciplinary education will appreciate what Glencoe has done.  The site offeres more than just these 12 online activities, too!Technical Remarks: Acrobat Reader is needed to download and print out the student worksheet for each of the twelve online art activities.",5
1697,"The purple colored website maintained by Mitch McCrimmon, Ph.D, aims to provide books, information about leadership in coaching. The content may be relevant but layout was barely appealing to someone who may not like that color. Learners may be distracted by over crowded design and advertisements and become short of patience to continue.Technical Remarks:Most links are working all right. Website layout seems a bit lack of professional polishing job. A bit too flashy, mostly information about books, some introductory viewpoints,but lack of depth overall.",3
1697,"After reviewing this lecture/presentation that provides advice for dealing with personal effectiveness at work I think that it does have some good material that is worth taking a look at but I also have several criticisms of it.  Content focused, it provides important information on doing your best in the front and center of the screen and it has appropriate headings and bullet points to follow.  It is appropriately focused on providing info to the readers concerning the development of their effectiveness.  On the other hand there are too many bullet points throughout the unit and what is most important is lost in the end.  Also the content is confusing in that it will ask a question to the reader, answer that question, provide facts, and ask rhetorical questions all in consecutive bullet points as if it was taken directly from an article and converted to a list (ex. ""Managing your time""). Overall I would say it is not great.Technical Remarks:I feel that it is very confusing in the presentation methodology itself.  As a user of this learning object, I am confused where to go from this page, what is included under the ""professional effectiveness"" unit and how to access that information besides returning to the site map after every subheading. I would say this does not have great potential as a teaching tool as I feel it would be much easier for a student to read a text-book chapter on this topic.",2
1698,"Excellent pedagogical tool! One of the best aspects of this applet is the """"examples"""" section, which has problems of varying difficulty to solve. The last one is really challenging!",5

1700,"After spending a good 10-20 minutes looking over the material, I realize this would be quite useful for students to understand a real-life application for math and making use of the equations for it. I looked through it briefly and followed the directions that is describing how to write the equation for that particular situation when comparing different plans. It's very well organized, much like a college syllabus, so it is easy to follow and navigate. The material accurately present concepts of graphing and how to apply a simple equation using the two factors to a graph, which can help us incorporate our understanding of it to harder and much more complicated problems. 

Although it is very short and intended more for the teacher as a teaching tool, it is still very easy to follow as it is broken down into clear sections, step by step, showing the methods and ways to approach the math.Technical Remarks:For a lesson, it's very well organized and easy to follow.",4
1701,This site features a number of real world case studies related to human rights.  I can easly see incorporating the short case study descriptions from the site into discussion forums or class discussion in my introductory ethics classes or in a more spicific ethics course on human rights.  The case studies range from issues of genocide to women's rights to business ethics.  All of the case studies seem to also be available in a single file is a nice feature.Technical Remarks:The website design is pretty basic but it's relativly easy to navigate the site.,4

1703,Good resoruces for teachers on this site for other ecological issues also. ,5
1704,"This could be useful if students are talking about open web searching and refining a search.

There is alos additional resources for instructors and easily accessible links.The students can see examples of the lifestyle and hear an oral interview to get a real feel for the cultural lifestyle. This can be a powerful tool for the studentsThe website is very easy to use with a handy menu on the left side of the page. All links seem to work very well.",5
1706,A really fine photo/audio ethnology of stories of American diversity.Technical Remarks:Cannot easily access other photos... arrow on front page does not rotate pictures.,5
1707,This presentation was and is very useful for my teaching of basic skills of decision-making and the theory of decision-making. This would be effective if used in a leadership or project management course to provide the learner with an understanding of how to make decision-making process work.Technical Remarks:Without audio the selection will require verbalization on my part to be successful. Audion portion or clips would make the presentation more user effective.,3
1708,I loved this website as a resource for students to use as a one stop reference especially since it contains many writings that are part of the high school curriculum. Technical Remarks: It was easy to use and straightforward for students. There wasn't any distracting information on the pages.,5
1708,"This site would make a great resource for students searching for poetry to use for various poetry projects in my class. I intend to begin using this site with my students, who often seek a site that offers a variety of easy-to-access poetry.Technical Remarks:Very easy to use and negotiate, even for ""non-poetry"" people.",4
1708,"I spent two hours reviewing the materials and various components of The Poetry Archive.The Poetry Archive provides a wide collection of poems that are easily accessed by users.  The website contains an archive of thousands of copyright free poems, many of which are often required reading in college literature courses.The Discussion Forum feature of this website offers useful information for students interested in poetry analysis.  The Forum has three specific components:  General Discussion, Homework Assistance, User Submitted Poetry.For students writing analysis papers, the general Discussion and Homework Assistance Forums are helpful for sharing ideas, asking questions and getting feedback from other readers of poetry.  While these remarks are not from scholarly sources--they are generally from other students-- they are useful for reflective students hoping to develop a reasonable interpretation or analysis that makes sense.The Poetry Archive claims ""to provide the largest free archive of classical poetry available on the Internet with a simple user interface."" The listing of poems is fairly comprehensive--certainly as diverse as any course literature anthology of poems.Technical Remarks:Navigating around the website is fairly easy and unencumbered.  I found it to be a bit slow in jumping to specific commentary about the poems.The search feature for specific authors, poems and discussion is easy to use but does not always take the use to the exact information requested.Each poem listed on the website has three possible features to access:  Links, Interpretations and Discussion.  The Links and Interpretations features appear to be under construction--these are not in use at this time.  Perhaps these will be live in the future; if so,
 this will significantly enhance the usefulness of the site.",4
1709,"I agree it is important for students to understand how ""music is a metaphor for life,"" and also how powerful a piece of music can be. This lesson seems to convey how the written song can have a number of influences on an audience, as well as many meanings that resonate with the listener. I find the point made in this lecture of how certain music (i.e. Beethoveen's 9th symphony) has  been intentionally used and associated during a specific historical period with policital propaganda is interesting, and can be expanded upon with many other examples where lyricists/performers intentionally wrote and recorded songs (i.e. Sting's song ""Russians"" during the Cold War) for similar purposes. An entire lesson could be taught specifically by heading down that avenue by exploring songs used for war-time propaganda or as a voice for change (something I've worked on to an extent in my own class). Bravissimo!",4
1710,"Was this lesson primarily for a middle school class or could it be used with an inclusion setting?

What is the amount of time needed for this lesson, could it be done in conjuntion with lecture or is a whole class needed?Technical Remarks:Were the students able to easily navigate this website or was alot of direction needed?",4
1712,good learning object with full description of Sikhism.,4
1712,This website is very educational.  I spent a good amount of time reviewing the materials and learned a great deal from the Website.  I knew little about Sikhism until I looked at this Website.  If you would like to learn more about Sikhism the Sikhism Home Page is the place to go.  <,4
1712,"This is easily the best site on the Sikh tradition to which I have surfed.  The virtual tour of the Golden Temple, the audio prayers, and the various video clips are very engaging as is the virtual Sikh wedding.  For a flawless traditional interpretation of the Sikh people and their history and religion this site is unequaled.",4
1713,"Overall, very comprehensive and informative. The site allows the learner to explore various aspects of the history of the U.S. flag including the national anthem. A quick quiz provides the opportunity to demonstrate how much an individual knows about the nation's symbol and dispells some of the myths surrounding its development.Technical Remarks:Problamatic getting to the actual site. Requires the individual to dig deeper rather than provides a direct link to the topic.",4
1714,"I spent about 30 minutes going through the various links and reviewing the material.This website is adequate for an experienced Project Manager, but is not geared towards a person new to Project Management.Technical Remarks: The website is straightforward and easy to navigiate.  However, it's not interactive and is geared to be used as a research tool.",3
1715,"Parts of the materials have been used by students as reference materials in two courses on software engineering. The materials embody a customized version of Rational Unified Process for the educational environment. The knowledge base provides guidelines for unifying the software development team by identifying and assigning responsibilities, artifacts, and tasks to members of the team. Many artifacts in the knowledge base are derived from a project case study and are used as examples or templates. A glossary, an extensive bibliography, and whitepapers are available for further reference.The materials represent educationally significant concepts and models for software engineering even if they have been developed in the context of a commercial process model. They are well prepared and easy to use. Such practical guidance is important for project-based software engineering courses. ",5
1715,"This site is a very good resource for students attempting to utilize the Unified Process in a classroom setting without getting too in depth.   The main page is a little misleading; appearing more like a book advertisement, but further digging reveals a plethora of process descriptions, example templates, and useful information.  There are, however, several places in which the companion book is required or heavily referenced, making it frustrating to seek information without first purchasing the book.  All in all, a very good learning site.",4

1723,This animation provides a nice overview of thyroid hormone synthesis. It's slow enough for students to take notes - great for beginners and those who prefer to envision the process rather than read about it.

1727,"If you are looking for a stable platform for creating and using wikis, this is the one that I recommend. I have used it for several years with students and K-12 teachers. Wikispaces is supportive of K-12 teachers. Free monthly webinars are offered to keep folks informed of current uses and possibilities. Our campus has a learning management system that has a wiki tool built-in, but it is very unstable and limited compared to what wikispaces offers. I am well-pleased with Wikispaces and how it stays current with the ongoing changes in digital technology.Technical Remarks:No coding skills necessary.",4
1728,"A wonderful tool for creating ""word clouds"" from text.  You paste in a bunch of text - a poem, perhaps, a Presidential speech, a chapter from a book, anything. The more times the word appears in the text, the larger the font.  You can play with the font face, color, and text orientation sixteen ways from Sunday.  You can also print now - you don't have to take a screen shot.A colleague doing her doctoral research on educational leadership interviewed a number of college presidents and provosts about their philosophies of educational leadership.  The transcripts produced beautiful maps of their committment to students and learning.  She printed them out in color, framed them, and gave them as gifts to the interviewees.",5
1728,Wordle is a great tool for brainstorming.  You can take minutes in a session and then pop the text into Wordle and provide a word picture that tells the tale of the discussion.Technical Remarks:You can use a screenshot of the Wordle cloud rather than posting on the site if you prefer.,5
1729,"I recommend this app to my students - you can rotate the brain, highlight certain sections, search for a part of the brain.  From a basic overview to a nice detailed explanation with case studies, associated functions, associated cognitive disorders, issues with damage to that area, research reviews, and links, it provides a quick, fun, and easy way to look at different parts of the brain in 3D. ",5

1731,"It was unexpected to see several unrelated options available in addition to the Accounting Business Tutorials. (At first I thought I clicked on the wrong link.) I only viewed the “Breakeven Point” tutorial which fell under the next heading choice of Managerial/Cost Accounting Tutorials.This was a self-paced slide presentation without sound. It, like the others, are accompanied by a handout which requires the student to view the presentation in order to fill in the blanks. I like that there are a couple of prompts that force the student to apply the principles and give a yes or no answer.It is unclear if these tutorials shadow any particular text or problems sets. If not, this tutorial would act as a good review of Breakeven Point. ",3
1733,"I thought that this lesson plan seemed to cover all necessary when educating students in the 5-8 grade range. It allowed students to learn in a variety of ways, and it makes it simple for teachers to access and use it in the classroom. I really like the incorporation of the book Jonny Tremain as well. A student's interest might be sparked by the reading of this book before the lesson is started, and it is a good way to introduce the topic of the American Revolution. I will definitely try and use this in my classroom!",4
1734,Very useful and interesting material,4

1736,"I confess that Nellie's home page confused and intimidated me. It seems there is a lot of great information here for collaborative project, but I had trouble finding it. I especially liked the idea of students being able to connect through writing to others in the world but I could not, without much difficulty, figure out how to get to the bits that explain that project or the others. There is so much here, but it is hard to get to without a great deal of starting and stopping and going back and forth.",3

Although the materials overall is correct and useful, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The first issue, as a grammarian, is the ""use a comma for pauses"" statement. When students hear that, they seldom go much farther. The end result can be seen in many entry-level college students who will insert a comma almost at random. Having taught many sections of freshman composition at the college level, I have had the devil of a time helping students un-learn the ""commas for pauses"" idea.The purpose of punctuation is to delineate the structure of a sentence, to separate items in lists, and to separate different parts or functions of speech. It has little, if anything, to do with breathe patterns.In general, though, the rest of the materials were thorough, detailed, and correct. The rules were presented in a clear, well-organized manner. This would be a useful, usable tool for middle school, high school, and college freshmen. Technical Remarks:Although most of the links in the presentation worked correctly, there were a handful that did not work at all. Some cleaning up needs to be done.",3
1737,You clearly stated the objective and the standard.  Sweet.  I like the Offical Rule book.  I can definitly use this in my classroom,5
1738,"This wiki-formatted training module on copyright provides a great introduction to these issues for librarians and LIS faculty.   The strength of this resource lies in its case study-driven communication of issues.  Although the amount of text in the module is significant, and would benefit from content in other modalities, the flexibility of print allows for easy translation to course readings or self-guided study.Technical Remarks:All links appear to be in working order.",4
1739,"As a librarian who teaches copyright to faculty, I found this module to be a bit simplistic in its explanations of copyright, and sometimes the explanations are misleading. It might be okay for young children, but for anyone old enough to grasp nuance, I would pick something else.
Also, navigation is sometimes a bit unintuitive--for instance, there are some slides in the interactive module that will progress if you click on them but have no visible buttons.",3

1742,"I enjoyed the game. The rhythms as presented would be difficult for a beginner who is just learning Cardiac Rhythm Interpretation. 
Would include the two types of Second degree AV block. Make the junctional and other basic rhythms more evident for the beginner.
I would use this for the practicing nuse who wants to review  they can decipher some of the rhythms and would not get discouraged when the rhythms are atypical- they love gaming!
Link case studies with stable and unstable presentations.Technical Remarks:Easy navigation.
Places learner in a "" cardiac monitor"" environment.",4
1742,I really enjoyed this site!  I thought it was a cleaver and interactive way to get a visual of dysrhythmias and how to read them.  I am in the process of learning how to read an ECG and this game correlates great!  It is a fun way to get a visual of each type of dysrhythmia while reading about each one.  I also liked how this was more than just information because it is always helpful to see what is going on.  It was also amusing to take what I had just learned and apply it to a game to further instill this knowledge.  This site has given me a better idea about what I am seeing on heart monitors and I will definitely recommend this site to my clinical instructor!,5
1742,"What a wonderful resource!  This truly is an exciting adjunct to a lecture on rhythm interpretation.  However, I had a question about your definitions of certain arrhythmias.  I believe the ""AV paced"" and the ""paced rhythm dual chamber"" to be synonymous terms.  I have always used them interchangeably in the clinical setting.  I was also curious as to why you didn't identify the other forms of second degree blocks.Technical Remarks:I enjoyed the ability to select different answers for the ekg game.  It is truly an interactive tool that appears to be a wonderful learning experience for students.  I will be sharing this information with my nursing faculty colleagues.",4
1743,Great job. I liked the real life examples (lunch price) to figure out the price using the formula. The more help icons are nice for the students to navigate for additional help. Adding the calculator was also a good idea. I did not see the grade level this was intended for on your presentation. Maybe a video or some sound could be added to the presentation.

1765,"Very appealing; most videos have multiple voices which illustrate different perspectives and make listening easier.  If all students attending a library instruction sessio had first reviewed this series the librarian would be able to assume some basic shared knowledge and could use the sesson to build on that.I appreciate the fact that this series of short videos shows specific examples from one library, but makes the point that all academic libraries will have similar resources available.  The one example where they do not do that is SFX: it would be helpful to point out that there are other link resolvers and that the service may be branded differently depending on the library.I was interested that while the subject approach shown in one video is a metasearch, there is noo explanation of how starting with this pathway could also lead to good and relevant articles or could be used to determine which of the separate resources listed might prove most useful for further searching.Technical Remarks:The default volume level on the different videos can vary, making it necessary to adjust it when moving through the series.  It would be helpful if you could navigate through the series on the website instead of having to return to the list on the resource description; mention is made of a ""main menu"", but it wasn't visible.  ",4

My only other concern is that the video demonstrates some hazardous practices (right versus wrong) with an operator on the tactor. It might be better to illustrate the ""wrong/unsafe"" practices with animation to better convey the message that risk taking is never acceptable (not even when filming a safety video).Technical Remarks:I did have to download a different version of RealPlayer to view the video; however, everything worked fine after that.",5

1794,"I reviewed this book with the thought of using it for an undergraduate epidemiology class. Therefore, my comments and overall rating about this online resource should be read with that in mind.  The author recommends Lessons 1-5 if the textbook is used for this target audience.  
Content
The content of ActivEpi is comprehensive and represents current thinking in the field of epidemiology.  These concepts are often taught in masters level epidemiology methods courses, and I would suggest that group as a target audience.  
Format of ActivEpi
The layout of the textbook is simple and very well thought out.  The homepage lists all 15 lessons.  If you click on a lesson, you will see a brief overview of the lesson along with links for 3-5 mini-lessons, homework exercises and a list of references for that lesson.  
I highly recommend that you watch the video listed under Lesson 1: Introduction – How to Use ActivEpi Web (video) as you will find valuable information for navigating the website.  For example, ActivEpi has a great glossary.  If you click on “Glossary”, you will see clickable buttons at the top of the page for each letter of the alphabet allowing you to quickly navigate to the correct glossary section.  Under the word, you will find its definition along with clickable links to where that word is used in different lessons.  
Once you have begun a lesson, key words used in that lesson are in clickable drop-down boxes along the right side of the page providing the definition.  On each lesson page, the content is primarily delivered in a series of short videos which stop often for the viewer to absorb the content, consider a question or perform a calculation.  
Quizzes are available at the end of most lesson pages which tests the user’s understanding of the content and ability to apply that knowledge.  Quizzes are automatically graded and the users are allowed unlimited attempts.  Homework assignments are given at the end of each lesson.  Answers to the homework lessons are available upon request from the author.  
A few suggestions
I have very few complaints about this textbook.  The textbook is laid out in lessons which cover everything from measures of frequency to counterfactuals and stratified analyses.  The content is comprehensive although I would have liked to see more on basic descriptive epidemiology, surveillance, reading scientific literature and ethics. 
The first content lesson (2), introduces students to epidemiology in terms of the overall picture using one study as an example which I like conceptually.  However, I think my students would really struggle with the content on those first two pages.  Several major epidemiologic concepts are introduced including: the study question, variable measurement, study design, measures of frequency/effect, bias and data analysis.  In addition, there are links which provide information about criteria for causality and a counterfactual basis for causation.  I am concerned undergraduate students will not be able to follow this lesson without previous exposure to those concepts.  
Summary
I believe that ActivEpi is a comprehensive, accurate, informative, easy to understand online textbook with a user friendly interactive interface.  I believe instructors who teach masters level epidemiology methods courses should seriously consider using this valuable online resource.    ",4
1795,"This site offers a lot of materials of ESL study for students as a self-study exercise and for teachers as great resources of assignment adn class work.  Personaly, 'Crossword Puzzles' activity is very useful as a warm-up exercise in the beginning level class and also would be used in any level of class depeded on the content of the activity.  Technical Remarks: Although it is relatively easy to navigate, it might be developed about the size of each question, because students might have to do exercises by using the computer for long time.",4
1796,"Similar to the Shockwave applet by Pascal Renault, this applet runs well and is very illustrative.",4
1797,"This StAIR for young students (grades 1-2?) is a nicely done presentation with content that, though I’m not an expert on elementary math curriculums, appears to be very age/grade level appropriate.The appearance of the presentation (graphics, font, color scheme, slide layouts, etc) is easy to view, read and is pleasing to the eye.  The use of animation and sound effects, though not present on every slide, helps add a little excitement to the presentation that might help some students stay focused on the questions they are being asked and are expected to answer.Some areas for improvement of this tool might be to make sure that there is audio and/or animation on all slides that are intended to give feedback to the student who is navigating his or her way through it.  Also, it might be helpful to add some kind of text to speech features so that students can not only see/read the information on the screen but hear it as well.  Lastly, it wasn’t entirely clear to me at first that clicking in any specific area on the screen on the first few slides would reveal a number sentence (I’m referring to the “Count on 1/2.  Write the sum” slides).  I just happened to click on an empty area of the slide and then it appeared.  It might be useful to make sure that the students are aware that a deliberate action on their part will make this happen.    I, too, created a StAIR for grades 1-2 using Power Point.  At this point in time I’ve not tested it with actual students so I’m not entirely sure how well it will work with young people.  After consulting with my school’s media specialist, I learned that it might be somewhat challenging for young students to navigate through such a presentation.  I think that when I actually use mine in a classroom setting, I might guide them through it the first time around.  This would technically not make it a StAIR since I’d still be guiding the students as they navigate through it the first time.  However, once I’ve taught them how to use it they’ll have better success with it and if I used the same or similar format with other StAIRS that I may create for other areas of my curriculum they’d be more successful navigating through those as well.  You might find it beneficial to take a similar approach when using this presentation in an actual classroom setting.Technical Remarks:Some slides have no sound effects where maybe there should be.",4
1798,"Suggest making the blue links at the top of the page larger font size for ease in reading.

Ease of Use: TOC available in frame allows uer to easily jump through the tutorial chapters.,3
1806,This took me to the home page of the University of Westminster. Not sure if it is a mistake or that is the intention of the materials. If that is the intention then the material tittle is deceiving.,2
1807,great site on microbiology and nanotechnology. Great to add into real world applications of micro beyond medical,4
1808,"I could've used this site when I was teaching the digestive system in a 5th grade class where I was substituting. The pictures are perfect and while the text is too much for 5th grade, I could have modified it for my students.",5
1809,This sight is pretty good. KM,3
1809,"Although not very sophisticated or flexible, this applet does illustrate a principle not covered by most other applets and that gives many students trouble.  Recommended.",4
1810,Very Good Resource,5
1811,"This is an excellent simulation site for undergraduate and graduate students studying Neural Networks. The mathematics is challenging. This applet uses (BSOM, Baysian Self-organizating Map) and Probability Density Function for simulation and modeling of Neural Networks and Artificial Life.Technical Remarks:An excellent teaching and research tool in the area of Neural Neworks and Artificial Life. It uses the method of estimation, expectation and maximization in the simulation of Neural Networks. The site is interactive.",5
1812,This is truly a real life lesson plan.  I think all of us do this daily.  This is really transferable to all ages.  I have seen lessons like this for older students that involve groceries and a 3rd variable because of the shelf life.  I like it. Technical Remarks:Having a minimum of 1 computer per group is low to me.  Every student should have their hands on the computer.  Each student could create their own graph or chart. ,4
1812,"I like this lesson. It could easily be applied to other areas of research and set clear expectations for new work while drawing from previous work.Technical Remarks:A viewer can read the comments between you and Amy on the side. If you want to remove them, you could link MERLOT to a pdf of the plan.",4
1813,"The Area of 2D Figures StAIR was an exceptional presentation of materials.  The immediate connection to real world examples actively engages the learner and builds motivation.  There are multiple pedagogical strategies that include a clear definition of content, a well thought out overview, extensive visual cues, and audio prompts.  The StAIR continually builds upon prior knowledge and clearly demonstrates the necessary reasoning to solve area for several 2 dimensional shapes.  The presentation also allows choice for the learner based on similar objectives.  The end of the StAIR offers a complete review of skills as well as multiple ways to reflect and assess area with appropriate feedback.The content was meaningful, but I may change the length of the StAIR to target necessary skills and be more specific.  It may also be beneficial to identify a target audience in the beginning of the presentation.  Finally, the video in the StAIR was not accessible within the presentation or credits.Technical Remarks:The video is not accessable in the presentation nor the credits.",5
1813,"I thought this stair did a wonderful job addressing the idea of area in a way I would have.  The stair did a good job of addressing several educational stratigies in an attempt to reach all students.  One of the stratigies that the stair incorporated was Instructional Design Principles.  Accoriding to instructional design principles, we need to let students know why it is important that they learn this information.  This stair did a good job addressing SEVERAL different carreers that would use this content on a regular basis.  Not only did the stair say why it was necessary for students to know this, the stair gave students its objectives and clearly stated what the goal was and how the stair would get you there.  Another part of Instructional Design, is the idea of continually showing students what we covered and where we are.  This stair creation did this in such a way, that it blended smoothly with the rest of the presentation.Along with Instructional Design Principles, the stair inculded stratigies from the Universal Design for Learning ideas.  UDL is all about breaking down barriers so that students can learn better.  This stair did a great job breaking down barriers, by addressing necessary background information at the start and reviewing vocabular.  It also included visuals for the shape showing what was going on.  This woud be really helpful to keep students from being confused.  I also really liked the way the shapes related to each other and would build on each other.  This is a great way for students to learn about the area of different shapes and really understand where this is comming from.  The  stair also did a great job scaffolding and building upon what students already knew and were familiar with.While I thought this stair did a wonderful job breaking down the concepts, formulas, and idea of area, I would make one change to it.  The stair only had one review question, and while the question was a good one, I feel more questions would be better.  I also would incorporate something (scaffolding maybe) to smooth the transition between the quiz question and the worksheet.  The worksheet was MUCH more challenging than the quiz, and I think that more basic questions would be helpful before jumping to that level.",5
1814,Fantastic lesson on finding the area of regular polygons! I like how you usd a real world opportunity to apply the skill. Students appreciate knowing why certain math skills are necessary and this lesson fully covers that.  The background knowledge and required tech skills are included which helps the teacher understand what is going to be required if this lesson is going to be successful.  I will definitely share this with colleagues. Technical Remarks:Great integration of technology to differentiate in the lesson.  I like the way you are planning to use the geometry software to allow students to test their findings.,5
1814,I like that students are asked to work collaboratively in groups and also use the Geometry software as well.  Students will be able to relate to the concept as they will relate to the Pentagon building.,5
1815,"Speed with these types of skills increases the amount of material which can be completed by any student in a given amount of time. The ripple effect into mathematics related areas is astounding. Students, with good mental arithmetic skills are also much more confident in mathematics.Technical Remarks: To ecourage students to practice with these skills on a regular basis, sound and animation might be included.",4
1815,"Great for testing how fast students can do simple mental arithmetic. Tristan De Frondeville has written a paper describing his use of this applet in his classroom. Kids that can add """"8+6"""" in less than 3 seconds do have an advantage when they get to algebra, etc.",5
1816,1. 40 minutes2. Very good simulation of an ATM to describe the object-oriented design and modeling methodology. Lots of examples.3. Very useful teaching and learning tool.4. Requires some thought ... not a 15-minute site.,5
1816,"Site provides a lot of information, will take a while to sort through. Good example that is easy to understand.Technical Remarks: Basic site, but easy to navigate.",4
1816,I spent about 30 minutes reviewing this website.  I found it to be beneficial since the example used is one that most people can understand.  The descriptions of the varios processes of Object-Oriented design were well-written and easy to understand and it didn't assume the reader had a strong grasp of the Java programming language.,4
1817,Excellent doument for a module on a course in attachment theory. A link to the entire course is provided. ,5
1818,"1. How did you review the materials? (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing it or 2 hours trying it?) -------I only spent a short while reviewing the material. I was focused mainly on the task at hand, creating a summary of the web page.2. The quality of content. (Do the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) ----------This sight has very quality content. It uses specific references and links to other refereed sites, such as American academy of pediatrics, one (possibly a physician) had any further inquries about the diagnosing of ADHD.3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning. (If used appropriately, will students learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?)----------- I feel this is a terrific site to incorporate into a course plan focusing on ADHD. The content is organize very well, sometimes with brief summaries alluding to another page that is further developed. If any one has a question about ADHD I would recommend this web site.Technical Remarks: First time users will have NO problem using this page. ",3
1819,"This is a great way to show he difficulty of living in poverty. Unlike the other reviewer, I found the controls very intuitive. It is a basic game, but gets the point across.",4
1819,Difficult to navigate... does not seem naturally intuitive.,3
1820,"This is awesome, I think it will really get students engaged!",4
1820,Interesting video. Has some good points and I would possibily show it to a high school Biology class as a form of entertainment during lecture.,3
1821,"There are many similar applets, and this one is no better or worse than most.",3
1822,Was very impressed with the speed of the java script. Very easy to use.,4
1822,"This is an excelent ""short cut"" page for individuals needing base conversions.  The short lesson on conversion techniques is interesting, but the real bang is the JavaScript, no more reams of wasted scratch paper.  The script, however, does not provide functionality for decimal conversions, but this is only a minor setback.",4
1823,"An (almost) ideal way for a student to learn how to use an oscilloscope without resorting to the real thing. Could use a little better explanations on its operation, but overall the explanations are helpful.",4
1824,"This is a good basic music site.  I think that middle school students could use this site as well as high school and college students.  This site does provide much in educational value.  I do wish that there was more interaction, such as a question and answer area.  But a teacher could use this site, and make up her/his own set of questions.  It gives you a good understanding of pitch/frequency and rhythm/time.  Throughout this site there are highlighted words which are links to other pages with the meaning of the word that further give you understanding of it.Technical Remarks: You will need Quicktime to listen so some of the musical examples.  Otherwise the site is easy to use.",4
1825,"Overall, there are several strengths to this StAIR. It will be reviewed on quality of content, potential effectiveness as a teaching-learning tool, and ease of use. First of all, the content contained useful information. It appears to present valid concepts, models, and skills. Information is provided about the organization that sets the standards for web pages, how to look at the code beneath the pages, and about the basic tags. It is a handy resource for a quick and basic look at elements in web pages. This StAIR is effective as a potential teaching-learning tool. It presents the information and has several different types of activities to test students’ knowledge. These activities include choose the correct answer, matching, and sequencing. Towards the end of the tutorial, it summarized what the students learned. The presentation was effective for ease of use; the viewer will not get distracted by unnecessary graphics or images. I found the background color of green very appealing. The labels, buttons, and general layout of the computer interface are consistent in this StAIR. The transition of text in the StAIR kept my attention. There is a suggestion of how ‘Basic Webpage Elements’ can be improved to make this resource more useful. When the learner chooses a wrong answer, immediate feedback is lacking on why the answer was incorrect. The viewer has to wait until the very end of the StAIR to review correct and incorrect answers to the quiz activities. I feel that a teachable moment is lost when you have to wait until the very end to get feedback. However, this StAIR was well done and I would recommend it to others for viewing.",4
1825,"Feedback for STAIR Cheryl Butler-Basic Web Page Elements Quality of Content The lesson presented in this STAIR showed accurate information on basic web page elements. Potential Effectiveness as a Teacher-Learning Tool This STAIR could be very effective for a teacher. The information was presented first, then a question was asked and it repeated that process for the entire presentation. I really liked the comprehensive review at the end. It also shared with you how many you got correct and gave a percent. Ease of Use The presentation automatically scrolled through. It was easy to see what you had to do to answer the question. I really liked how you used different avenues for selecting an answer, it made it more interesting. I loved the program that you used, very cool!",5
1826,"The review of this material included more than two hours reading, interacting and listening to the variety of materials from this site. This web site was designed to describe the characteristics and explain the impact of the Latino community in the United States.  They achieve these goals by a combination of testimonials from different Latino individuals, analyses of demographic data and commentary by journalists and academicians. The BBC?s Mundo Latino is divided into four different sections.  Section one, introduccion, discusses the aims of the project.  Section two, mapa interactivo, provides a rich assortment of factual information about Latinos in California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and New York with the corresponding bibliographical citations.  Section three, vivencias, presents short autobiographical vignettes by a broad spectrum of Latinos.  Section four, figuras, presents in interview format different prominent Latino figures including activists, athletes, writers and entertainers.  The final section, audio, includes audio material dealing with different aspects of the Latino experience.  Intermediate-high and advanced level students can use this site.  It is well suited for classes designed for heritage speakers. I. Content QualityThis web site provides an excellent introduction to Latinos in the United States.  It offers a rich assortment of authentic materials ranging from statistics and facts to interviews and autobiographies.  Maps, charts, photographs and audio files supplement these materials.  The articles and the audio materials present an interesting,
 well-structured and cohesive introduction to the topic.  The site offers examples of different writing styles, from the intimate personal to the impersonal scientific style. II. Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching ToolThis web site can be used as the raw material for a unit on Latinos in the United States.  It will need to be supplemented with vocabulary, grammar and cultural explanations and exercises.  In addition it can be enriched by adding pre-teaching activities, such as: brainstorming, analysis of visuals, titles, pictures, skimming and scanning and other pre-reading techniques.  The same can be said for the audio component of the web site.  Finally, the materials lend themselves to a series of follow-up exercises and for the more advanced levels as the starting point for projects dealing with a deeper discussion of the topic. III. Ease of Use for Both Student and FacultyThe site is very well designed and it is easy to use.  It has a clear set of objectives and a logical cohesive structure. The variety of activities contributes to the achievement of the overall goal of the site.  The audio files and links provided in the last section give the user a starting point for further development of the topic.  Technical Remarks: Internet Explorer or  Netscape browser and Real Audio player",5
1826,"Perhaps, the best are the audio series providing a rich assortment of topics:Latinos, !SI! (Una miniserie de Via Libre de la BBC.)Programa 1 - La importancia del voto latinoPrograma 2 - Latinos en WashingtonPrograma 3 - Los Angeles, ciudad multiculturalPrograma 4 - Miami, el poder del voto latino.   La Palabra Americana (Una serie de la BBC sobre el espa?ol de America. Presentada por Eduardo de Benito y producida por Horacio Brum. Archivo 1991)--Chicanos - Poesia y educacion bilingues  Entre Dos Mundos: Ni?os y Migracion a EE.UU.

The website is ideal for intermediate and advanced Spanish language students, and especially beneficial for Spanish for Heritage Speakers courses.  The heritage speaker will easily identify with the themes covered.   Many writing activities can be generated from the themes based on the common experiences.  ",5
1827,"This would be better with a time domain, so you could see that a 3 Hz difference in the two tones creates 3 beats per second.",3
1827,"Good display of the effects of interference and frequency differences and their relevance to the real world (such as in tuning musical instruments). The explanation is helpful, and there are tips on what to watch while playing with the appletTechnical Remarks: Needed to manually update changes to the frequencies of the waves, which is nice in that it doesn't eat up memory like other applets.",4
1828,I liked this site because it reviews other webquests and explains why they are good. There is also a section describing what a good webquest is and you can contact the author to review your own webquests and rate them!,4
1829,"The majority of reports of breast cancer research originate from high income countries and their outcomes may not be relevant to clinicians and patients in the less well resourced low and middle income countries (LMCs). This useful site provides access to the titles and abstracts of over 5,000 published reports of breast cancer control research conducted in or relevant to (LMCs) that may otherewise be hard to identify. The Library was built as part of an international collaborative project involving teams at the Breast Global Health Initiative, International Network for Cancer Treatment and Research, and the CDC Foundation and was funded by Komen for Cure and the Office of International Affairs, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda MD.",4
1830,"I spent about 20-30 minutes with this item.  At first glance, this is a very appealing applet with a simple user interface and clear display. However, its effectiveness as a teaching/learning aid is very limited.  All calculations seem to be correct (though not to the number of digits displayed). The impact parameter is selected as an integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive) -- there is no indication of the meaning of this number since none of the quantities have units and the size of the balls is not given. The scattered angle is given as NaN for an impact parameter of 0 -- most students will not know what this means. The applet could be used as a lecture/demo to qualitatively show the relationship between impact parameter and scattering angle, and the relationship of the velocity components to momentum conservation. It is not of much use as a quantitative interactive lecture demo, or as homework, or for drill and practice because too much information is given -- nothing is left for students to figure out. Students could use it to check an analytic solution to this special class of collisions.",3
1831,I liked this quiz! It was very easy and it covered so many topics in biology and chemistry. It is a good learning tool as well as providing examples for teachers for their own tests and quizzes. ,4
1831,Very good site to use as a study tool for a biochemistry exam. The quizzes cover all of the important topics.,4
1831,Great for students seeking possible exam questions regarding Biochem. I think it makes a great study guide.,4
1832,Great paper but would be hard for average microbiolgy student to understand. This would be a great paper for a gentics class or microbial genetics class ,4
1833,This site has a vast amount of clips to help teach in class. It is a wonderful resource.,5
1834,Great time lapse movies and some great plant information in the text as well. No other site like it. I use it in a class as the raw material for investigating plant growth.,5
1834,"I have used this text. It is good, but not quite as good as a traditional textbook.",4
1835,little hard to make out the pictures and graphs since its in a pdf form,3
1836,"Great lesson. Just a few grammatical errors.  I think this lesson may be a bit long and would work best if it were broken up a bit-over 200 slides may be overwhelming to attempt in one lesson. You cover a lot of material but some of the slides were a little crowded with information.**Additionally, it does not appear that ther are multiple means of of action and expression or engagement (perhaps an outlink to a video or other material would be useful or even an interactive map regarding biomes).  Technical Remarks:When a question is answered incorrectly on a few of the slides it takes you back to the material and question before the section you are currently on.  Also, for fluidity I think it might be work a little easier if the ""next"" button was in the same place on every slide and if entire answer (letter and word) was hyperlinked instead of having to hover over the area to try to find the ""sweet spot"" on the link. ",4
1837,I had some trouble running the applet on Solaris (Netscape).  Explanations of the physics would have helped.,3
1838,Couldn't access the material. Received a message saying the link was invalid.,2
1839,"A useful applet that runs well, although a little slow.",4
1840,"For cognitive psychology courses, the ""Neurobiology of Vision"" section has many good resources. Particularly useful are the blind spot demonstration and the contrast/color illusions. Also see the ambiguous figures page under the ""Reality"" section.",4
1841,"Educational Value: Transiting images, labelling and running background commentary makes it very informative. Way beyond any standard textbook",5
1842,I have used the BRANDS simulation for several years in a Marketing Seminar course and recommend it without reservation.  It is simply the most accurate simulation of the marketing world I have ever seen.  Technical Remarks: Be sure to have a good tech assistant to run the simulation for you.  Input and running the sim is time consuming.,5
1842,"Since 1996, we have used BRANDS? as the foundation of an experiential marketing course in our undergraduate management program.  BRANDS? is an exciting simulation that engages students in a surprisingly ""real world"" experience.  It is also robust enough to be used in multiple sections, year after year.  Instructors can vary many simulation variables to make each administration a unique challenge.  Dr. Chapman also provides excellent support including student and instructor web sites.  He is also available via e-mail and phone, and we have been delighted with his quick and friendly responses.Technical Remarks: Since output each ""quarter"" can be voluminous, we'd strongly recommend use of a laser printer to print student and instructor reports.",5
1843,Quite an interesting site. Gives the great detail about everything to do with tobacco.,5
1843,"I can hardly imagine that a site discussing tobacco does not include a history of health and medical-related science issues.  The name of the site does not reflect the narrow geographic coverage (i.e. NC), nor what appears to be a very biased perspective that has little, if anything, to do with good biology education.  Perhaps this site could be included under some other category such as social science, economics, history, etc.?  I would suggest leaving it to knowledgeable people in those disciplines to evaluate that possiblility.  I read some or all of the text in each section of this site.Technical Remarks: It is my observation that little, if any, content from this site would have useful applications in biology education.",1
1844,"   untitledI spent about 30 minutes trying different things with this item.  I like it a lot -- it is simple, but veryeffective in illustrating the phenomenon of Brownian motion, as well as effects of interatomic collisions.  Theability to slow the atoms down and to change the mass ratio is quite revealing. The only problemI discovered is that it displays very bad physics at mass ratios near 1.0 -- the red particle seems to gain energywith every collision, and is soon is whipping around at speeds much higher than the other particles. It would have been nice had the author told us what force model is being used; it is not a hard sphere force.",4

1845,"This site strikes me as extraordinary.  I love everything about it - the gorgeous visual design, the intuitive navigation & information architecture, the lighthearted tone, the personal approach, the student-centered design, the integration of content and interactive elements, and even the Creative Commons license.  I'd love to see any data that the creators have on the site's impact & the level of student usage.Technical Remarks:Works well, just wondering if it works with screenreaders & non-mouse users, it very well may, I just can't tell at first glance & I know this can be a challenge with visually appealing work.",5
1846,"A tutorial on the rebuilding of a prarie using various plants and animals, while it looks very good on the surface it does not seem to be very useful as a simple model. It also has grasses not native to the area listed, which is not conducive to repairing a damaged area.",2
1847,Great website to incorporate for information and media literacy; note that some content is mature in nature.,5
1848,I do teach a course on Copyright and the Teach Act and will recommend this site.Technical Remarks:Good links to YouTube videos.,5
1848,"This site is exactly what the doctor ordered. If I had a dollar for every person who asked me about teacher copyright issues during my workshops, I'd have at least a few hundred bucks!Technical Remarks:Love the blog interactivity!",5
1848,This site can be useful to those who need a starting place to research copyright and fair use law. A primary goal of the site seems to be marketing a book on the subject and it appears to be a good resource. Some information on the topic is available but a user would have to buy the book or use other resources to get enough information to guide decisions and actions. Information on this topic is badly needed and this is the only entry that I know of on the MERLOT site.Technical Remarks:The blog is easy to read and provides links for comments and other tools. Navigation of the site is intuitive and clear.,4
1849,A quick and to the point site to gain information quickly on how to calculate the difference between two dates.,3
1850,"http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~jmahaffy/courses/s01/math121/index.htmlThese course pages may get shifted around, so this might be a better url:http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~jmahaffy/courses.htmlHigh school mathematics teachers used one of the episodes on Dr. Mahaffy's Calculus for Biology web site. They enjoyed it.  Their Internet experience was supplemented with a group discussion led by a mathematics professor.Quality of ContentExcellent! The Cricket Thermometer. (Listening to crickets on the web, then using a linear model for relating to temperature.) is one of several interesting problems.  Dr. Mahaffy's  laboratory experiences are well designed; pre- and in-service teachers find them very interesting.  Potential EffectivenessThese animations provide a semi-concrete experience for teachers (to be).  If ""participants"" merely watch the animations, they will not be helped much toward understanding the concept/principle being presented.  If the (future)  teachers take the next step and do the exercises themselves, those teachers' own understanding should be greatly facilitated.  Also, this site would be good for expanding teachers' ideas of how to present the lessons to their own students.Teachers will need to develop their own rubrics for evaluating the products completed for the laboratories/homework.""This item is currently under review by the Teacher Education Editorial Board."" 7Technical Remarks:Ease of UseRequires level-4 (or higher) Java-enabled browser.Most of the mathematics will be done with either the spreadsheet software, Excel. Some assignments require a powerful symbolic algebra package developed specifically for mathematics, Maple.",5
1851,"The layout of the content makes it easy to use and the areas seem to align with the need expectations of the discipline. The resource list (online linkable) are easily accessible and will form a base of useful tool-kit items for mathematics practitioners. Pre-service practitioners, who are specially encouraged to use this site will benefit from the teaching and learning ideas in the site and the connection to other practitioners. Communities of practice are very useful for practitioners. As such, the link to related professional communities and the listserv which allows for the development of a network in this area is commendable. While this is a quick review visit, I think the site offers valuable information and resources in the area of Mathematics Education.",5
1852,"Good collection of information but this appears to be nothing more than a website. It is marked as a social networking tool, but I was unable to find how this website was used as a social networking tool. Perhaps there are some linked from the site, but if so, they need to be more clearly designated or highlighted.",3
1853,I learned a lot from this lesson. I like how the student was encouraged if the answer was incorrect. The redirection of providing a review of the material covered was very useful.Technical Remarks:Everything downloaded and worked fine.,4
1853,"This is a stand alone lesson on carbon bonding, obviously intended for older students. Throughout the lesson, students learn about the types of carbon bonds and are asked to indentify the bonds throughout the presentation. The presentation itself is easy to navigate. The design doesn't distract from the content. Overall, it was very well done.Technical Remarks:PowerPoint viewer is required.",4
1853,"This is a quick introduction/review to Carbon bonding and the specific 3 types of Carbon bonding (straight, branched, ringed). The presentation is great with sound, transitions, appropriate information, and feedback for all the questions. The only thing I would suggest is there be more questions. This would be great as a very quick review that was followed by more indepth conversation or another Power Point show. Technical Remarks:No broken links",4
1853,"This Stand alone Instructional Resource (StAIR) is very well designed for the intended audience of 8th grade chemistry students. It clearly connects them with the concepts of straight, branched, and ring shaped carbon bonds.It is an interactive kiosk.

1854,good to have relevant health-related information readily available,4
1855,The 'force-ranking' card sort of career values is easy to follow and simple to use for career coaching. The downloadable MS-Word or pdf file of follow-up worksheet is a useful tool for client's learning and application to his/her decisions and conflicts that may arise.,5
1856,Another good applet from Wie.  Accompanying explanations are very good.,4
1857,This lesson was good – it was very interactive and provided good feedback for the students that checked their progress along the way. I did not see multiple learning strategies other than recalling knowledge of what was just read. There was a lot of reading on some of the earlier slides and that might prove troublesome for select students.  I would suggest inserting an audio track on each slide that read aloud the text. Another object that could be added is an explanation of what Catia is.,5
1858,Lovely site focusing on building the field of digital storytelling. User experience very good.,4
1859,"The Center on Technology and Disability provides access to resources on assistive instructional technology and to free webinars (and accompanying resources). Topics include accommodations at different grade levels, specific technology tools and activities, techniques for parents, and materials creation.  The library has resources for early childhood, K-12 education, families, transition, and state/local leaders. The classification of materials makes this site useful for a broad spectrum of users.",4
1860,"I love how simple and yet effective this applet is. It perfectly demonstrates a concept in my intro stats lectures and I am going to use it this semester.Technical Remarks:Pretty simple. Although you can accumulate die rolls, it doesn't display the total rolls so far, which would be a nice addition.",4

1865,Animated gif demonstrates the phenomenom of electrical charge very well.  Nice explanations.  Very useful.  Those teaching introductory electromagnetism should show this page to their students.,4
1866,The flow charts on this are very good and easy to follow.  The reading material itself is more of a college level than high school unless you have an AP or Honors class.,4
1867,"Lots of good information although the kinetics and thermodynamics links seem to not be working. Too much text, may be hard for students to dedicate the time to just sitting and reading.",4
1868,"Nicely organized, with good mix of explanation and examples, plus some useful tips that would be very helpful to a student.  Drop down boxes to choose specific examples were especially helpful when there were several examples, as with AV materials.",4
1869,This is a very interesting site.  Central Processor Unit chips are dyed and photographed in such a way that they become art.,5
1870,A nice assignment that has the students looking at real data from a Science paper to learn about both chromosome abnormalities and evolution of the primates. I have also done it where I just give them the figures without the instructions and see what they can figure out.,4
1871,"Nice graphics, and runs smoothly.  Lots of user interactivity.  The downside is that three-dimensional perspective is hard to come by since the coordinate frame cannot be rotated.  Works well in two-dimensions, however.",4
1872,Web site that examines the mathematics of rainbows.  Would serve as an excellent project for calculus students.  Technical Remarks: Not a java applet.,4
1872,Those discussing rainbows should visit this site.  Teachers may find the questions to be very helpful.  ,5
1873,This applet serves more to instruct others how to create their own applets than as a standalone pedagogical tool.,3
1874,"Well-designed applet, but there isn't much to do here.  The source code would be very helpful to those writing their own applets.",3
1875,"Content quality - 
The simulation helps learners visualize the position vector and the velocity vector in a uniform circular motion.  The site explains that the object accelerates due to the change in the direction of its velocity and indicates that this acceleration is toward the center.  Newton's Second Law is also used to justify that there is an unbalanced force and that it must also point toward the center of the circle.  
The text refers to the simulated motion as Circular Motion, whereas it only demonstrates a Uniform Circular Motion where the speed is constant.  Also, It would have been very helpful to also show the acceleration vector.

Potential effectiveness as a teaching tool - 
This site provides a decent introduction to uniform circular motion.

Ease of use - 
No particular plugin or application is needed to view the simulation.  The site is easy to navigate.",3
1875,"this site was really helpful in aiding my understanding of circular motion, the problems were especially helpful. kmorgan",4

1876,Too much text. No enough graphics or diagrams.Technical Remarks: Technically correct and easy to understand if you know the subject. Not for beginners.,4
1876,Overall great source for teaching how switches and ethernet networks are setup.  I really liked it because I took a class recently on computer networks and it goes along with it.,4
1877,"This is very easy to follow and very informative! I also think that the multiple review opportunities that you provide is definitely helpful to learners. I really liked the sliderocket program you used, as it was very easy to navigate. Technical Remarks:The only suggestion you may consider would be to include more audio. ",4
1877,"Your StAIR looks great source for students to learn the triangles, especially for 2nd or 3rd graders. The explanation was very clear and easy to understand. When considering its audiences, this instruction would be better to understand to have less words rather than to explain the concepts in full sentence. Technical Remarks:Using sliderocket to present your lesson is fabulous with a brief instruction on bottom of presentation. With the icon for next slide other than simply clicking anywhere in slide would suggest more polished look because there is ""BACK TO QUIZ' button. ",4

Treatment pathways are linked to clinical evidence and user selections are critiqued in light of the evidence.Language used is of of an understandable level for nurses with minimal use of abreviations. Complex terms are expalined in text.Cases are clinically appropriate and evidence is current. Treatment options and choices are not contextualised based on availability of clinical services and assumptions are made that best practice treatments are available to all patients.Ideal resource for individual continuing education for the post graduate specialist cancer nurse to consolidate understanding of complex treatment options.I could not see where users can print out a record of their choices within the case or evidence learning from the modules. Technical Remarks:Reviewed using firefox 3.6.16 browser.Loaded quickly.Site adheres to common web conventions.Animation used appropriately to grab interest without overdoing it.,4
1881,Always looking for ways to improve content. Please feel free to share your thoughts.,5
1882,"The Fractal Coastline site is thought provoking and quite informative. It is laid out very methodically and the two examples provided have elaborate steps to enhance the grasp of concept. I perused through the java applet but it was not as informative as the text. Although it conveyed the concept that was stated in the text but not without reading the text over again before being able to interpret the results. I have a map hanging up against my bedroom wall and never in a zillion years it stuck me the complexity involved in coastline measurement. Anytime I wanted to get the distance I would count the number of longitudinal (or latitudinal lines) and size it using the scale indicated on the map. It was pretty interesting to learn that coastlines like many other natural objects often exhibit fractal characteristics and that two distinguishing characteristics of a fractal are self-similarity at different scales and fractional (non-integer) dimension.The site is pretty informative for people who would like to learn about the existence of fractals in real world. Also it briefly touches upon the usage of log-log graph paper. Nevertheless it took me a while to understand the contents of the site, I believe to have good understanding of the topic the prerequisite in geometry and fractal must be met.",4
1882,Generates Fractal coastlines and allows measuring of resulting coastline This is one of the premier examples of an applet which has been the center of a curriculum unit on fractals and measurement.,5

In fact, an instructor can just draw the density curve on board to demonstrate the difference, which is much easier than setting up the module in class.Technical Remarks:In order to see the plot, one has to specify the max and mix boundary in the x scale, or no plot is shown. There should be some default values such as -4 or 4 to avoid the problem.",3

1890,Good website for finding out what is going on in the world of computer architecture.,4
1891,"Dr. Pat Deubel's website is a casual looking collection of k-12 math resources. Its mission is to harness the power of ed tech for standards-based curriculum. It links to sources on math initiatives, methdologies, manipulatives, projects, software.  It includes items for learning support, and professional materials (e.g., research, standards, PD). Math teachers should find this a good go-to site. ",4
1892,"This is a cool site. It is extremely simple, and any computer should be able to run it. This comic and educational page allows you to make calculations on a crude calculator using ancient Roman Numerals. The page provides a table of the Numerals and their definitions, so the user will not be confused if they have no experience with Roman Numerals. I only spent ten or so minutes on this site, and I was impressed. It's sublime in it's simplicity. This is a very educational site, for all ages, as I learned Roman Numerals in elementary school. This is an extremely effective way to learn this system, and can be easily utilized by teachers.",4
1892,This is a neat site.  It lets the user mess around with a calculator that is associated with the Romans.  I spent about 15 minutes just putting in different numbers and messing around with the calculator.  The site also gives us lots of information on the calculator and what errors the user may encounter when using the calculator.  This is a great model of what a calculator would look like if there was to be one during the Roman times.  The teacher can definitely use this site to teach the students the history of calculators and how each one was different based on time and people.  The calculator was easy to use and the instructions were easy to understand.,4
1892,"This is a neat web page, if you are looking for information on the official calculator of the Romans.  They explain fully how to use the calculator and tell a few jokes on the way.  It is probably a good page for you to check out if you need to review your Roman Numerals too.  They have a link to an abacus site that is less helpful than most of the ones that I have seen.  Nevertheless, the virtual calculator and abacus work fairly well.  Technical Remarks: Not a very sophisticated website and very few links.  However, it is not unexciting.  I think that it is worth looking at, especially if you are interested in the original calculator.",4

1898,Very impressive! I am very grateful for this effort. Looks like a lot of work have been done to make this site possible. I use this site to review my chinese learning. This is great for learning chinese by oneself.Technical Remarks: A book is needed to follow the recording which I don't readily have. Maybe the pinyin text should be included. ,5
1899,"The problem being address is the need for first grade students to effectively learn to count mixed coins and to solve number stories problems. There is scaffolding in the lesson by having the students first determine the value of each coin, practice counting, and learning to count objects in class. The students are clearly motivated by learning how to use their counting skills in the real world and working together in a group.  I believe the lesson is too long and there is too much technology/and lessons planned for such a young age group.  With the whiteboard activities, the online independent practice, the computer games, the counting of the coins, and writing and solving problems, they may start to feel confused and overwhelmed.",3
1900,"Coursera is a great website. It offers many courses in several fields such as mathematics, sciences, technology, engineering, education, and bussiness. I am very familiar with this website because I have taken many online courses in engineering offered by Coursera. According to my experience, all courses in Coursera are taught by the best professors in the world. Finally, I highly recommend all students, engineers, researchers, and other people interested in education to register courses at Coursea because these courses will help them improve their career, education, and learn new topics in different areas of study.",5

1907,"Useful, but slightly biased against the death penalty.  More objective than most resources.",4
1908,"The site gives an extensive look at depression and crisis intervention. The site use PDF files to present the information. Therefore it is necessary to have an updated version of Adobe to be able to read the files. The interactions require real player. This makes it a little more difficult for some people to use. This site is also very dense and specific so it should be used for students are want to look deeply into depression and counseling for depression. It would be a little too much for an intro psych student just starting out. However, the information is presented in a helpful and fun manner.Technical Remarks:Requires some technical programs that may make it difficult to use in a school setting.",3

1916,"This sounds like it could be a great lesson. I think a discussion forum would be a great addition, seeing as how much of the material lends itself to open-ended discussion. To that end, you might consider adding an RSS to the course (I'm not sure if if could be embedded, but a link would work just as well). Subscribing to feeds based on key terms revolving around business growth in Africa could help students make the connection to a real-world situation.Technical Remarks:No comments.",5

I returned this time to review the site from the Merlot ""perspective.""The quality of content is outstanding.  I love their ""Digital Dozen"" and ""Lesson Plans & Activities.""  I always find wonderful new sites.  This time I found National Library of Virtual Manipulatives for Interactive Mathematics at http://matti.usu.edu/nlvm/index.html .  (The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives for Interactive Mathematics site is very interactive...much of it is still under construction, but it really has some valuable resources.  The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning will be enhanced if classroom teachers augment their lessons with some of the experiences these authors have created.)  Mathematics education majors will want to be familiar with this site.I particularly believe that the Eisenhower site was one of a few sites that really helped launch mathematics educators toward using the Internet for wise and appropriate applications for learning mathematics.  I am thankful to the ""founders"" of this site for the service they started and continue to provide.  Technical Remarks: Very easy to use use their materials.",5

The StAIR effect was very effective starting with a simple problem and working to more complicated problems and bringing in the concept of the fact family. Students will enjoy participating in this activity.You included just the right amount of information on each slide and the quiz questions were great practice.Technical Remarks:I am very impressed with the design, presentation and educational content of your StAIR.A very nice design style and appearance. The animations of text and graphics were very entertaining. Students will enjoy using the StAIR. The music and sound effects are great. The buttons and hyperlinks all work.Consider narrating the text to help all learners. You may want to include on slide 11 a practice of how a student would input an answer.",5
1933,"This is a great stand alone PowerPoint resource that is a great introduction to long division at a lower and middle elementary school level. Technically speaking, the language is all very clear and in big and easy to read text that isn't the least bit confusing, an important aspect to think about when dealing with kids of the target audience. There are many, many images that all have a purpose in representing what the text already said. One of the aspects that I especially liked about this StAIR was the way that integrated feedback was incorporated. Students are actually asked questions throughout the presentation. Interactive buttons on-screen would pop up, and the user would click on the answer they thought was correct. When they clicked correctly, they got a large cheer sound effect, which acts as somewhat of a novelty idea that gets kids into th learning by making the StAIR somewhat of a game and a learning resource. I thought that the layout and progression of the slides was excellent as well. Every slide had animations and sound effects that served as an interest capturer as well as not allowing kids to fly through the StAIR. Stopping kids from consistently pushing the forward button when they think they understand it  and ""forcing"" the to review each slide for around 10 seconds is a great attention grabbing method. The only thing that I would maybe have added would have been a video of some sort to give students just 1 extra pedagogical methodology of getting across the information, but this is just a minor nit-pik. Also, a back button along with the provided forward button would have made navigating the slide show a little bit more advanced. This is a well done StAIR and I would definitely recommend it in an introduction to long division. ",4
1934,"I used this in class to demonstrate the ELISA procedure, it is very thorough and my students reported that they learned the steps of the ELISA.

Even though it is a commercial website, it is easy to understand the topic, so we could experience most of all parts in the website for free. Maybe teachers and students could use it for reference in emotional intelligence. It is very easy to use the materials. Technical Remarks: I had notany difficulty to navicate the website. The address is very simple and speed of browsing is very good.",4
1937,Thanks for sharing your slides about the OER movement!  I enjoyed the slides.,5
1938,"It was a creative idea to use weebly.  I like that you explain the format in the beginning of the lesson.   There is a way to get back to home screen and it's easy to get forward and backward.  You use visuals to illustrate the lesson, which is helpful to various types of learners and some video.  Is there a way you could have information presented through audio as well?  There are  informative pieces that help explain fractions to students. I would like there to be specific information about the age group.  Also the picture used in the header could complement the content of the page.  It threw me off.  Perhaps you could also have the separate pages listed on the left side so people could navigate through the page that way as well.  It can be confusing to navigate through.",4
1938,"I would rate the ease of use a 9 out of 10 after spending about 7 minutes using it for my own review of fractions!  It's such a good idea to create a StAIR on fractions for 7th graders!  I think fractions are something that many, many, kids do not understand, even in middle school, but they are expected to and feel like they should know it by then.   This StAIR is simple and interactive, and not intimidating if the user is not comfortable with fractions.  I like the multiple choice and re-direction when an answer is wrong, and the visuals with pie charts and blocks is also helpful.   I think using Weebly for this was definitely easier than PowerPoint (which I used!). It seems to link nicely from page to page.  Such a nice example of a StAIR- I can totally see this being used as an independent work station in a classroom or at home for extra practice.    Nice work!!!  I did have a question about the last page, it seemed to get stuck, or have no ending.  Am I missing something? ",4
1938,"I have never thought of using weebly for a webquest, the flow of site is great and was very functional.  The inlcusion of video in the midst of the lesson was very useful.  The fact that you are able to score the quiz afterwards was a great way to keep track of student understanding.  ",5
1939,"In 1956 the Dutch graphic artist Maurits Cornelis
Escher (1898–1972) made an unusual lithograph
with the title Prentententoonstelling. It shows a young man standing in an exhibition gallery, viewing a print of a Mediterranean seaport. As his eyes follow the quayside buildings shown on the print from left to right and then down, he discovers among them the very same gallery in which he is standing. A circular white patch in the middle of the lithograph contains Escher’s monogram and signature.  It amazed me how he did design of the white patch in the middle, before i read the the material i would think he just painted it.  I like the mathematics he involved in the piece.  I like the idea of the mathematics used on the picture becuase it can be viewed as drawn on a certain elliptic
curve over the field of complex numbers and
deduce that an idealized version of the picture repeats itself in the middle. More precisely, it contains a copy of itself, rotated clockwise by
157.6255960832. . . degrees and scaled down by a
factor of 22.5836845286.  Its amazing how we can put an idea that will make it possible to make an annular bulge ""a cyclic expansion without beginning or end"".  Another good example is the way one transforms a single closed loop, counterclockwise around the center, from
the curved world to the straight world. It reflects the invariance of the straight picture under a blowup by a factor of 256.  I like the idea how such phenomenon takes place if we do not walk around the center of the piece.  The idea that we have the factor of 256 will take us to make something so beautiful like the pictures that escher has done.  Another idea and figure that amazed me was figure A5x5 square transformed to the curved world, i like it because the lines line up straight with each other and we can still make the curves on the picture event though the lines themselve dont curve.  So every thing that escher done gave me an idea in how art work can look better than if it was just drawn on the paper without making some kind of chart or graph and mathematics.",5

1941,"I spent about 45 minutes exploring lesson plans and utilizing the teaching-learning activities.  Overall, this user-friendly website contained original and innovating ideas for teaching English through music.I would certainly use this site for future ESL classes and recommend it to any professional working in the educational field. Technical Remarks: Lesson Plan- ""Musical Chairs""; Beginner Level, any age; Focus on VocabularyQuality of Content:Website- The website presents a wide array of material and some valid lesson plans in relation to the learning of English through music. However, one must be weary in choosing the right lesson plan to implement for classroom use. It may be difficult to find the equal balance of musical/language pedagogy. Music is simply used as a means rather than as an additional content-oriented teaching concept in order to enhance English vocabulary acquisition.Lesson Plan- The ""Musical Chairs"" lesson plan is an original concept since the students are learning the vocabulary hands-on. Moreover, the material is presented in a clear, effective manner.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching-Learning Tool:Website- I believe that the website, in general, could certainly be used as an effective teaching tool. I have yet to try out some of the actual lesson plan demonstrations in a classroom environment. Of course, adjustments and accomodations would need to be made.Lesson Plan- As for the lesson plan, I believe that ""Musical Chairs"" with the vocabulary could be used as an effective teaching tool since the students are able to see and interact with the vocabulary words. The music is simply a reinforcement to learn the new vocabulary. I believe that it is next effective way to introduce vocabulary after TPR.Ease of Use:Website- Generally,
 the website is fairly user-friendly since it is basically a point-and-click layout. What you see is what you get. When you click on a particular icon, it does not bring you to a link that has nothing to do with the material. The layout of the webpage is organized and clear. However, some of the links lead you to a dead URL address.Lesson Plan- ""Musical Chairs"" could easily be implemented in the classroom; however, the teacher must plan strategically ahead of time. When laying out the vocabulary words in a circle, the teacher should utilize large pieces of paper with eye-catching print so that all students are able to see the vocabulary words during the lesson demonstration. In addition, the words should be evenly spaced out in a semi-organized circle so that everyone has easy access to touch the words when they are mentioned in the song. Vocabulary should be taught in advance (via TPR), and students should have an idea of the lyrics to the song. In addition, the teacher should choose a slower song with a singer whose voice is clear.

1943,"I plan to use some of this material in a class - i think it's a GREAT collection, and that the Peer Review rating might be lower than expected because the material is general ethics, rather than just business ethics - is there a better category for it on MERLOT?",4
1944,Nice overview of ethyleneTechnical Remarks:No techical requirements,4
1945,"This site is fantastic.  The main pull is the graphical walk-through of each Proposition in Book I of Euclid's ""Elements.""  The most confusing proofs and constructions are laid out in a clear, step-by-step approach, with each new piece of the proof being added to the diagram through simple animation.  Books II, III, and IV are also present.  The only drawback is the lack of material after Book IV.Technical Remarks:Almost too easy to use.",5
1946,"Most of the applets on this site, such as this one, are more applicable to engineering, rather than physics. However, the applets appear to be well-conceived and written. Those teaching thermodynamics with an emphasis on real-world problems will find this site useful. I suggest users start with the introduction/tutorial.",4
1947,"This is an informative site for text based learning of neurons and action potentials. Very much worth the read, and students interested in this material will find it worthwhile.",3

1949,"I spent approximately 30-45 minutes exploring this unique website and found it to be quite interesting.  In my opinion, the quality of the content was of a high level and the various offerings of this website were noteworthy.  I believethat this website acts as a very significant teaching tool, which would most definitely benefit both students and educators alike.  I found this website to be quite easy to navigate and had no problems accessing the information providedby this website.",4
1949,"This site was a definite 4 stars.  I love to look at things that are like optical illusions.  This site will capture your attention.  I especially liked the bird in the cage experiment.  You can't exactly use this site for information,  but it was a fun and exciting site.  I spent about 45 minutes going through everything. Technical Remarks: It is easy to find your way around this site.  Everything is straight up and easy to understand.  ",5
1949,This is a fun website.  It is interesting to see how your eyes can be tricked.  It was easy to navigate. ,4
1949,"This was a fun website, and interesting also. It is nice to be able to acutally particpate in the learning activities. It is amazing on how your eyes can play these tricks on you.Technical Remarks: This is a very easy website to use",5
1950,"Interesting article on one researcher's experiences in Second Life from a parasocial perspective.  Unfortunately, it did not avoid the tendency of such articles to become a ""show and tell"" about what the researcher did in Second Life. ",3
1951,"This lesson seems wonderfully engaging for students as it provides many connects to real-life experience. There are a number of ""bigger questions"" posed that require students to use prior knowledge and critical thinking to come to a solution. This will allow students with various learning styles to use their individual skills sets to come to a solution to the problem in a unique way (compared to a traditional ""inputs -> equation -> solution"" type problem).Additionally, this lesson utilizes technology both as an instructional tool and as a tool for students to solve the problems posed (i.e. how does one retire as a millionaire while only making minimum wage?). There are multiple means of representation suggested and group work is used to reinforce prior knowledge.Technical Remarks:The pdf link works. The lesson references the use of Dabbleboard as an additional resource, however Dabbleboard appears to no longer be available (shut down earlier this year).",4
1952,Good resources,5

1955,This article was published in online journal of otolaryngology JORL supplementary edition,5
1956,I really like the different stages in this lesson. The students will know where they are at all times. Ther are lots of oppoertunites for the students to discuss their learning. I like the example problem of the Pizzas at a sleepover. This gives a great opportunity to connect prior learning. I would really like to hear how your students got on with this lesson. Great Job.Technical Remarks:Good use of Technology. I enjoyed seeing how you used the document camera. I am trying to get some for my school now.,4
1957,This is a quick and very clear video showing what happens in flashover.  It also shows radiative heat transfer very clearly,4
1958,"In this particular web site I spent about 30 minutes reading.   The reason that I gave it the score I did is not because is bad, but for the simple reason that I didn't find it interesting at all.  This web site is educational if you agree with the authorsa?? theory that zero and infinity are ideas that do not make since unless new rules are are created to make the use of these two ideas easier to use and understand.  The author also talked about what Overflow, Underflow, and the Roundoff error were. The main idea of this site is to show were the author believes about zero and infinity.  As for the materials used in this site it took me a little to figure out how to use the tools and to know what to do with them.",3
1959,"Fonetiks is a unique publication in more ways than one. It's the world's first CD-ROM where you can simply mouse over text to hear it spoken - quite a big step forward in language learning, making an instant connection between the spoken and written word. But it's also a new way of looking at languages: each language is divided up into six types of sounds: single vowels, diphthongs, triphthongs, voiced versus voiceless sounds, consonants, and stress/intonation. The result is that seemingly 'hard' languages like Mandarin or Japanese suddenly become quite easy to get to grips with. Another unique thing about Fonetiks is the fact that it presents seven varieties of English: American, British, Australian, etc. - ESL learners won't find this anywhere else, at least not in this breathtakingly convenient mouseover format. The same goes for Parisian versus Canadian French, and German versus Swiss German. There is also a ""Spoken Grammar"" for ESL learners, plus conversation patterns for English, French and German. More than 40 people comprised the ""cast"" of native speakers that put this production together. This is a unique, major resource for people who love languages. Technical Remarks: Early technical problems with Fonetiks have been ironed out.  Minimum requirements are now only that your computer have sound and the Flash player installed - almost all computers already have these.  IE preferred, but Netscape works OK. Mac or PC.",5
1960,"I spent about 15-20 minutes reading throughout the page and messing around with ""blaze applet"".  This is the first time I have read anything about Percolation.  I found it hard to follow at first until you explained what it means, then everything started to make sense. I think that this is a good way of getting to understand percolation.  The fire spreading through trees, and the coffee in the pot are great representations.  I think first time users will find this easy to use as the blaze applet is accurate, and fun!",4
1961,"The information is helpful, practical, clearly organized, and void of extraneous material.  The ""Examples- what NOT to do"" section confusing because parts of it are what TO do (the first two sections).

1968,What a great site learn about transcription at a basic bio 100 level,5
1969,I think this will be a great project. I think that students can learn a lot from doing that kind of research on one genetic disease and presenting the information in a creative way.,4
1970,This lesson supports both independent learning and cooperative teamwork skills. With talking it over with their partner a certain iterative process may take place where they need to work together to get the same answer.In doing this they are taking part in peer assessment and guidance which is a very powerful tool in the classroom to develop.The students in this activity are on a inductive process of inquiry with the use of technology.Maybe at the end the students could create a Voicethread or Prezi to discuss their activity with peers.,4
1970,Very professional looking lesson.,5
1971,"I used this site as a resource for interdisciplinary lesson development.  The teachers in the course were pleased with the organization of the site and several remarked that they, in turn, used the site with their own students.  They said because the photos were real, with dates, and place names (and that they were on the Internet) their students were motivated and wanted to know more.  For these same reasons, and the power of the actual images the potential for cross-curriculum lessons is very good.",4
1972,This is a very authentic lesson that all students need to learn.  The three parts of the lesson will really help students have a deep understanding of the concepts.  I love the idea of the lab activity.  It is a great way to show students how germs spread.  Students will enjoy the activity and be learning at the same time.  The objectives are clearly listed.  I am interested in using parts of this lesson with first graders.  ,5
1973,Good as a source of information.  ,4
1974,"This is an extensive library of terms. Though in the introduction the author states he hopes it will be used by individuals who wish to converse with biochemists, rather than it being used by biochemists themselves, most definitions seem to require a rather solid understanding of the field. For example, to define 'G-loop' one is redirrected to the 'AT queue' definition, which reads:""A model that accounts for chromosomal banding. The microscopic appearance of chromosomes during mitosis (metaphase) displays chromomeres and interchromomeres, i.e. G bands (Giemsa stain) and R bands (Reverse) respectively; the former are characterized as AT-rich and gene-poor and by late replication, and the latter as GC- and gene-rich and by early replication. The DNA is presumably organized into wide spring-like coils from which 100kb G loops extend parallel to the chromosome axis (G bands), extended DNA sequences from which larger loops extend perpendicular to the chromosome axis (R loops), and AT-rich sequences called matrix-attachment or scaffold-associated regions that anchor the G and R loop regions and create the characteristically stained bands.""Though an extremely thorough defnition, there is simply no way a beginning student or someone outside the field of chemistry would be able to gain much knowledge from this definition. This would certainly be a good reference site for advanced biochemistry students to suppliment any biochemistry course work.",4
1975,"There is one acronym in the lesson plan that should be explained.  Additionally, the learner is expected to learn a new software program in order to create the expense report however very little is discussed about the learning of that software. Additionally the lesson plan is directed toward the author's experience and not toward the student or another instructor.  The technology needs should discuss the software program students are expected to learn.",3
1975,"In the problem and need section, there does not really appear to be a problem or need stated other than ""to help employers"" and mentions some goals. However, it's unclear if such goals will address any specific problem or need. The instructional objectives appear to be goals only for an instructor. They should be changed to be geared towards hopeful outcomes for potential learners as a result of participation in the lesson. The essential content should reflect a certain amount of information related to the lesson versus the three areas of motivation, audience, and socialization.",3
1976,"This is a great resource for teaching the basics of Google Docs. It is well organized and the objectives are clear. The images and sounds are very helpful and appropriate for the application of UDL principles. The questions are definitely an important part of the instructional design. I really liked this StAIR and I will be using it with my students in the future.Technical Remarks:This is a great PowerPoint presentation, after unzipping the files everything worked well.",5
1976,Outstanding work! I will be keen to use this for workshops for my teachers and administrators. The navigational buttons are simple and the audible feedback sounds are appropriate. The module covers a vast range of Google Docs features and sometimes activities concerning the features can get repetitive but they are presented with engaging animations. The underlying instructional strategies are cooperative learning and non-linguistic representation of scenarios through animations and videos.Technical Remarks:The action buttons work fine on any platform for PowerPoint.,5
1977,This fact sheet about the GoOpen program tells about the benefits of using open textbooks/resources in K-12 education for both teachers and students. It also shows the importance of OER collections like MERLOT. ,4
1978,"In my experiences using classroom software, I can see that this will be a very useful instrument for me to use in a teaching environment. I appreciate the fact that there are numerous different curve concepts that I can apply, thus making it more of a one stop location for my graphing needs.Technical Remarks:The software loaded fast and I found great ease with the operation of the program. The zooming feature on  the graph will make it easier for the teacher to explain and focus on concepts.",4
1979,"I am a student and used this website for an assignment for class.  I thought the material was easy to understand and follow.  The pictures and animations backed up the descriptions very well.  The visuals were very clear and displayed the concepts very well.  I thought the material was very educationally significant, and would see it as a very effective teaching-learning tool.  It could be used in the classroom as a part of a lecture or as additional resources for students to use on their own time.  It is a great visual aid for concepts that are not always easy to see. Technical Remarks: This website was very easy to use.  All of the links worked properly and no outside assistance was needed.  I did not run into any problems concerning hardware or software requirements on the machines that I accessed it from.   ",4
1980,"This resource is jam-packed with all the information that students needs to know about slope-intercept form. The instructional design of this StAIR provides learning in various forms such as examples, videos, tutorials, animations and sound, practice problems, and applets. It was easy to navigate and the author gave clear instructions on what to click, where it would take you, and what it would show you. The design and images were also very appealing, especially to the audience that this was created for. Because graphing in slope-intercept form is a large concept, the only thing I could think you might want to consider is breaking this resource into separate resources in case students get overwhelmed with the amount of slides and content or even assign students to view only a portion of the resource. However, having it all together would be a great review resource for students before being assessed on the concept. Great job!! I love it!Technical Remarks:I couldn't get some of your videos to work.",5
1980,"What a fantastic resource.  I wish I had something like this when I was learning slope-intercept.  This .pps was put together very well.  The information was great and the question portion seemed like a great assessment of what students should have learned.  You did a nice job of breaking up the information into managable parts.  This isn't always an easy concept to grasp, but I think students will benefit from using this resource.Technical Remarks:I didn't see any technical problems with this STAIR.  Everything looked and functioned great.",5
1980,"This is a great resource to show students how to recognize slope-intercept form and how to make graphs from slope-intercept form.  I know from experience how much students struggle to understand how to grasp slope-intercept form, but this would be a great resource to allow students extra remediation.  The resource allows students to learn the material first, then provides hints and tricks to remember the slopes or the formula, and lastly allows students time to practice their skills.  I really liked the video links, especially the football one, that helps students understand the vertical intercept.  Students are more likely to connect to ideas that they have a personal connection to and many middle/high school students connect with sports.  This is a great connection that will help students understand how to determine the vertical intercept.  Great use of sound effects and animations - the practice part is crucial for students to understand math and this resource does a great job of allow time for structured practice. Technical Remarks:This is a Powerpoint Show for 97-2003 versions of Microsoft Powerpoint.  If you are running Microsoft Office 2007, you will need to select ""view slideshow"" from the Slideshow Toolbar at the top taskbar in order to view the slideshow.  The show will not begin automatically in Powerpoint 2007. ",5

1983,"I have used this story in the classroom to introduce the roles and power of the media during in American History which in many instances were covered up. This story had been passed on, but many did not want to believe such action occurred. This story reinforced the segregation of Oklahoma well into the 20th century and most of the leaders fought to keep the cover-up covered up. When it comes to reparations, and the excuses White leaders and now Black leaders have used to ignore the issue, to just lie, For example, unless there are living witnesses come and tell your story and when they did, more were alive than they expected, they found Whites some who were possibly part of the mob, to testify against. TO only talk about scholarships at the low $300.00 is not only insulting, but disrespect to those who died and fled. They talk about the 2nd amendment as a God-given right, except for the people determined to die.I lived through the lies, but I was fortunate to have been taught by courageous Black teachers who were determined I would know the truth.  There were other places of rioting in the period called the Red Hot Summer, Coming back from World War I dressed in their uniforms, many Blacks were beaten, the recipients of tragic beatings, hangings and other hideous acts resulting in deaths. This reaffirms how truth crushed to the ground will rise from ashes.  Here is an excellent study of race relations, or better still no relation.  The story even give insight to why racial problems still persists in the 21st century.",4
1984,"Previous user comments seem to have been lower due to 404 errors.

1987,"This does provide a solid visual representation of overtones. The limitation here is that I find the most impactful teaching of overtones comes with sound and music, and that's not included here. If the app could include a simultaneous auditory component, it would become very cool indeed.Technical Remarks:Does not seem particularly resource intensive despite running through the browser.",4
1988,"I used this resource in my class about teaching online, in the section where we talked about various approaches to teaching, and how the ""online"" part can fit in with those approaches.  This tutorial provides a good set of tips and advice about how to actually create a PBL environment.  So much of the other information I came across was just describing what it is and why it's so great. But in my class of education majors, they need to know HOW to implement it.  So that was the strength of this resource. The weaknesses included referring to the debunked idea of ""multiple intelligences"" and in referring to poorly performed research that ""students who learn online do better than students who don't."" That's not actually what the research says. (Clark's ""mere vehicles"" statement comes to mind.) There's nothing intrinsic about having a computer that increases learning.  Rather the factors that increase learning are the same, whether a student is online or not: motivation, time spent, quality of information available, supportive environment, and so on and so forth.  Anyway, soap boxes aside, this is a decent resource. It could use some updating.Technical Remarks:Too many ""branches"" in the tutorial. Make things more streamlined, and it would be easier to follow and remember where you are in the program. Some of the links opened new tabs instead of just going to the next page in the same window, and some pages lacked the navigational arrows. It's kind of buggy and could use an overhaul of otherwise solid information.",3

1994,"Wow! What a great STAIR! You did a great job of scaffolding instruction for learners. This powerpoint reviews terms using websites and fun videos, then provides a real context for which students would need to add/subtract/multiply/divide/fractions. I loved the SOLVE method you used to help students think critically step by step while completing each task. Finally, you gave students a chance to put into practice solving fraction problems on their own with guided feedback to try again if necessary. I think this would be a great way to help students learn fraction operations. Great job!Technical Remarks:Everything worked great with this Power Point",5
1995,"This VDO cartoon is very informative about fraud.  Despite that, most people know that stealing is wrong, but why do they steal through fraud?  According to this VDO, the 3 conditions that make fraud are pressure, opportunity, and rationalization.  The crime triangle theory involves the target, the offender's desire, and opportunity.

Nevertheless, in the end, it is the rational choice [free will] of individuals. ""Rational Choice theory in criminology"" Just like Rita Crundwell, who committed fraud crime for over 20 years due to her position that gave her complete control ever city finances [opportunity].

Being a storehouse for many learning modules and tools, the site is text-heavy but pages are easy to navigate through. Clear, brief descriptions of outside resources are placed following each link. The descriptions inform the user of what the new site contains. Some of the linked websites require audio and supplementary plug-ins for full functionality.Technical Remarks:When the user clicks on a link to an outside website, the new link opens in a new window. This allows the user to reference to repository easily. User can use their browser's back and forward buttons to go to different content areas.",5
2030,"There was not that much information on this site about kirigami. I was interested to learn about it since I was unfamiliar with it, and the ideas of origami seem closely related to it. I spent a few minutes manipulating the wedges and changing the colors of the shapes, but that is as much as you can do. The site is good for those who learn visually because there is not a lot to read. The instructions were brief and not too informative. I think the only way for this to be effective as a teaching and learning tool, is if you try to do kirigami with your own hands.  Technical Remarks: It was very easy to manipulate the wedges and change the color of the shapes.",2

2038,"This acitivty clearly defined the concept of exponents. Using links to videos and websites helped explain concepts from various perspectives. I liked the different approaches to interacting with the material through games, videos, and interactives. The base camp is a good dashboard providing choices for the user to pick.  The lesson was very heavy in content and would benefit from more than one session to fully cover all the material.Technical Remarks:The links were sometimes a two step process and it would be easier if the link would go directly to the activity.",4
2038,"Very informative and extremely interactive.  It lost some of my attention because of the length.  I liked the fact that the show incorporated many different types of websites, videos, quizzes, etc.  I thought it was great for covering exponents.  I wasn't sure how much time would be spent in class doing something like this?  Or maybe it could be broken up into separate class periods?  I thought the ""base camp"" idea was good since it allowed students to dictate the way that they wanted to learn about the concept, whether it was reading or video, etc. It really allowed students to explore UDL strategies of representation, expression, and engagement.Technical Remarks:I had some timing issues, but I'm not sure if that was because the show was opened in Keynote instead of Powerpoint.",4

2048,"A mind strategy game is presented on this page; somewhat like Tetris or Connect Four, games I used to play as a child. The purpose is to connect five or more balls of the same color in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. I played the game for some time and enjoyed it but struggled to find any math relation. After connecting five in a row randomly the game disburses three balls of color into the field. I searched the webpage for additional information or explanation on the game but did not retrieve any. I enjoyed the webpage and the game for its mind exercise but did not discover any traditional math other than counting five or more in a row. I thought the webpage was a good exercise for the mind and for a possible word or application problem. The material was presented in a clean and clear way that was easy to understand and navigate through. I enjoyed the game and the page for a brainteaser very much!",3

2051,"This StAIR could be easily adapted to other novels or readings.  I enjoyed the use of video.  Knowing plot elements is important at all levels, and I could adapt this to a middle school lesson.  The only adjustment I would make is that some of the slides are a little text heavy.  I may separate some of the information out onto separate slides.",4
2051,"Reviewing plot structure is an important point to make in any language arts course with students of any age. This StAIR specifically relates the lesson of plot structure to the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" While I think that connecting the lesson to a specific book might limit the usefulness of this StAIR for some teachers, there are enough educators teaching this book that it will still reach a wide audience. I can also see myself adapting this lesson to meet the needs of a more general audience or an audience reading a different book. The use of videos from the movie version is a powerful way to explain concepts such as rising and falling action, which can be abstract for some students.Technical Remarks:This is a PowerPoint slideshow, but does not open in kiosk mode right away. Users will need to click ""play slideshow"" in order to run the StAIR.",4
2052,"This is a worthwhile project; one would like to see it expanded. I concur with most of the comments made previously. LitGloss includes significant texts that are difficult for most students to handle without some glossing. The glosses on the texts I explored were translations of words and phrases. Contextualization of specific passages would help. Each text needs to be explored separately by The instructor will want to evaluate each text individually, as the level and value of the glosses differs.Technical Remarks:I did not encounter a number of the technical problems noted earlier; however, I did encounter an occasional glitch on texts that were on multiple pages. Some of the links in the ""Context"" and ""Resources"" sections accompanying the texts have become broken.",4
2052,"Good selection of texts and very nice concept: providing reading materials with glosses. Would really benefit from wider use of contextualizations, background info, etc. It would be an excellent group/collaboration project, with specialists in each genre/language proposing texts, annotating, contextualizing, etc.Would be a good resource for intro to lit courses in the different languages.Technical Remarks: Same comments as previous user. Plus - there are several ways this could be made cross-browser.Some glossed areas ran together with preceeding and/or following words.",5
2052,"This site is based on a useful project and has great potential.  The set-up is very straight-forward.  It basically puts a library of foreign language texts online with glosses being available but not in the way.  Typically, annotations are translations only.  For the most part this is sufficient, but occasionally explanations might be helpful.Technical Remarks: I encountered several problems, but they are not such that they prevent using and enjoying the site altogether.  Moreover, they can probably be addressed and corrected easily:- in certain instances, the annotations show up in varying spots on the screen (sometimes at the margin or not at all; seems to depend on where the words and cursor are);- different display fonts are used for different texts; it might be more effective if they were consistently the same base font;  (I noticed that this and the first item seem ot be related...glosses with texts in smaller fonts appear to work fine);- it seems most ""about the text"" buttons do not contain anything (yet); too bad since this could be added easily;- also, the four buttons on the frame all look the same...having to move the mouse over them to get a hint seems somewhat counterintuitive and silly; why not use icons?- the texts load quite slowly (at least today...maybe this is only temporary);- the left frame does not seem to renew consistently; an image that goes with one text/author will stay for another (by another author);- it appears (re)loading a page also reloads all frames/content, including the ""credits""--is that necessary? (should the credits be separate, to cut down load time?)",4

2055,"I reviewed your StAIR and must begin by saying that it was so neat. Flawless. It was very easy to navigate through and the activity was very engagjng. I was able to open it and run it with no problem at all. I liked the sound effect. However, it caught me off guard and my speakers where loud. Nevertheless, students will love that. I also liked how you offered additional resources on your last slide. I am very familiar with Kahn Academy. I even have the app on my iPhone. If there is something I could change or add it would be to include a home or end button on every slide. I wanted to go back to the list of resources again, and I had to go through the entire presentation again. But then again, that may be a positive feature for students. I would also prefer it to be longer. Overall, this is was a very effective StAIR. I would use it in my class.",5
2055,This is a great use of power point! I enjoyed it and was humbled by my lack of math skills.  I liked the examples that asked you what to do next and adding a few more of these along with some more problems and this would be outstanding.Technical Remarks:These not a lot you can do with power point beyond what you have already done.  This lesson would be perfect for Camtasia Studio.  You could recorded you lessons and quiz throughout the video.  This would also allow you to narrate the video.,4
2055,"I really liked your StAIR. I remember learning this in high school and your presentation was clear in the information it presented. I do think another couple of examples would be helpful before going into the assessment.Technical Remarks:In the example question, when you answer incorrectly, it doesn't allow you to retry the question before moving on. Also, after the first question in the assessment part, the variables don't match up between the question and possible answers (the equation will say ""y"" but the answers say ""m""). Otherwise, it was easy to navigate and read.",4

2057,very informative,5
2057,This article has a large complicated wealth of information. When I began looking at this article I was expecting to see a lottery game but to no avail. It's information is widely spread out and for me at least my head would probably explode from all of the info. I wouldnt recommend using this cite for a teacher or student unless you don't mind reading an hours worth of random mathmatical information like I did.,3
2057,"I spent nearly an hour and a half reviewing this site. After about ten minutes I forgot I was supposed to be reviewing it. The Monte Carlo method of estimating pi was the first thing to catch my eye, and I especially enjoyed the many sections on random outcomes. I found just about all of the activities and materials on this page to be thought provoking and sound. I do wish there was more to it all. Although some of the units were a little to limited for my liking. Unless you are pre-disposed to the more proxy visual learning, you will have a little bit of trouble at first with the examples.",4
2057,"This site is not only interesting and informative, it is actually fun.  The language is clear, it gives good definitions for a beginner, and most importantly to me, it gives specific things to think about and try while in the site. Thinking about the questions provided while flipping the coins was really interesting.  This site also leads in to other related sites which build on the initial site. Because I had so much fun with the coin game I was inspired to read more about ""what is random."" This site definitely enhanced my learning experience and I would recommend it (especially for those who need a visual representation to ""get it"").Technical Remarks: This site was extremely easy to use and understand.

My favorite part of this were the specific problems it gave me to try and figure out.  Now i didnt go through every single one, but the ones i did go through were not only easy to understand but fun as well.  I think that anyone who is looking to learn any of the subjects covered would find this very easy to learn off of, or use to help check if you have any questions.  I know i will defiantly come back and use this as a resource when the issue comes up.",4

2078,"Many scientists believe in, what is called pantheism, the idea that the complex working of the nature around us is the only palpable God we can deal with. For this reason, Reality is the name used by philosophers to discuss God, so that the highly emotional content that goes with the word God can be avoided. From this it should be clear that reality is the same as metamathematics. Most philosophers agree that contemplation of Reality is the highest form of happiness. So, if you want happiness, play Metamath Solitaire all by yourself. Technical Remarks: The applet Metamath Solitaire lets you build simple mathematical proofs from axioms in logic and set theory. This applet is based on a program called Metamath, which can express theorems in abstract mathematics, accompanied by proofs that can be verified by a computer program. Looking at Metamath, confirmsmany of my beliefs. Beauty, simplicity, and rigor are the same. You can trust a computer more than a mathematician. You must accept the four color conjecture, instead of quibbling about it. All proofs of all mathematics can be arranged in the lexical order in The Book, the amount of paper available being the only limitation (see White Hole, Black Whole and The Book, in Merlot, Foundations of Mathematics).This means that you can read The Book and collect as many theorems as you want, but don't ask for a solution to your conjecture. There is no good mathematics that a good high school student cannot understand. Any problem whichhas a solution, has a simple solution. It is not enough to define empty set, you must define the Void, when not even the empty set is there,
 of course, Void is not a set, but we need the name. If we have Void, we can call a Dedekind cut a Void. If we have Void, we can answer the uncomfortable question, What was there before the Big Bang?, the answer is of course Void. It is not enough to define cardinals, we want the Absolute, which contains all the cardinals. Of course, Absolute is not a set (fortunately for us, Cantor has accepted this fact).",5
2079,"For me a very complete and  amazing research. It revealed  half of the works of  Servetus (10), which had been lost for more than 500 years.

2104,"My first test was to convert -10 decimal to binary, and this gave an error message saying that '-' was not a decimal digit.  There was no note on the tool itself that negative numbers were not allowed.  The tutorial didn't mention this restriction either.   

Although there may be a good reason for the restriction in ""lesson 1"", one can hardly advertise this as a suitable tool for ""introductory math or computer science course(s)"" and for an audience including ""Graduate School , Professional"" when it is so ""minimal.""  Computer Science students, in particular, need to know about how negative binary numbers are represented using two's-complement--and everyone should know how to represent them in all the bases included in this tool by prefixing with a negative sign! And how hard could it be to include this in JavaScript?   

After testing the quiz system, I agree with the previous reviewer who found it very elementary: it does not include any particularly effective feedback or opportunity to learn from errors, and there's no obvious reason for not reusing the ""Explanation"" functionality from the conversion tool itself to explain how the correct answer is obtained, instead of just displaying it when the student gives up.   

The look-and-feel of the tutorial part, at least, could stand considerable improvement also, especially use of a grid to display the positional notation.   

The whole system appears to be very much a ""quick and dirty"" implementation of the easiest part of number conversion.  It needs considerable improvement in functionality, content, and documentation--both the tutorial and the user documentation--to be suitable for the intended audience.   

I doubt that those who gave a high rating for this tool had checked many other such tools--though perhaps there weren't so many on the web when they did their assessments as there are now.  There is now no need to use such an elementary converter, or to settle for such an elementary ""tutorial.""",2

2127,"8.12.1          This problem and its physlet animation is a goodattempt to visualize the fact that expansion throughheating is unique to each metal.  However, theanimation could be improved by enlarging thetemperature scale, in order to provide for moreaccuracy when estimating the temperature change in themetal bar.  Since it was mentioned what units positionand time were measured in, it could have been includedwhat units the temperature scale showed.  8.12.2        I enjoyed the animation of the growing bubble risingto the surface of the liquid to burst.  The countingvertical position scale also aided in performing theratio computation.  However, after carefullyperforming the final to initial temperature ratiocalculation, I disagree with the featured result.  Icalculated the ratio to be 6.05.   8.12.3        This animation clearly underlines the properties ofan ideal gas and is nicely done in a, however, purelyqualitative manner.  Overall, I?m not sure that theproperties of an ideal gas need this kind of elaborateillustration.  Simple pictures would have sufficed.8.12.4        The speed vs. time graph nicely illustrates thechanges in the speed of the molecules of the gaseoussubstance but aids little in showing the average speedof the molecules. This visualization could be improvedby displaying the average speed of the differentspheres at the end of the animation to assist in thecalculation of the average kinetic energy.8.12.5        In this problem, a gas is compressed at constantpressure and seemingly at the constant temperature of0 *C.  Since the container appears tight (no moleculescan escape),
 I can only ask how is this processpossible.  The pressure should have been visualized ina better manner.  The gauge added more confusion thanit cleared up.  More work needs to be done in orderfor one to make sense of this problem.  Additional Problem 1)        I had a hard time changing the temperature of the gasin theleft container in the running time provided. The running time should be increased to counteract notonly this problem, but also in order for the system tobe allowed to come to equilibrium.Additional Problem 2)        This physlet worked well and is a good illustrationof the distribution of speeds in a gas.This site could benefit from a more detaileddescription of the problems? initial conditions. Furthermore, the given answers should be accompaniedby a few sentences of explanation.  Overall, this siteneeds serious improvement to warrant its use over oreven in addition to a generic textbook.",3
2127,"The material covered by this review are the problems 8.12.1 through 8.12.5 and the two additional problems.  I spent a couple of hours going though the problems and my own books trying to figure them out.  My overall response to the physlets offered at this sight is lukewarm.  The goal of providing an interesting, interactive approach to physics is a worthy one; however, these physlets sometimes fall short.  The descriptions (setup) for the problems could be improved by offering better framing assumptions for the situation.  The illustrations themselves are not as clear as they could be; embarrassingly, it took me more than a few minutes to realize that that ?thing? in problem 8.12.4 is a pressure gauge.  The potential for effective learning through these physlets does exist, but I feel that the choice of problems and animations could be improved upon.The very first physlet, 8.12.1, explores thermal expansion of solid rods, the point of which is to show that for rods of equal initial length an equivalent change in temperature will result in an equivalent change in length.  This physlet was fine, though I would suggest making it more apparent or readily seen that the change in lengths actually is equivalent, such as posting the position change, perhaps as done in problem 8.12.2.Physlet 8.12.2 gave me the most trouble of the lot.  Assuming that we are to use the ideal gas equation, I didn?t get their answer after playing with it for a while.  The idea for this physlet is a good one though.Physlet 8.12.3 offers a brief and VERY qualitative view of kinetic theory and does not offer anything beyond a similar textbook picture of the three containers.   Physlet 8.12.4 is an uninteresting trick question,
 and it failed to illuminate or illustrate for myself the equipartition theorem in a useful way.  Should an underlying assumption (if it be true) that the system is in thermal equilibrium be stated for the reader?  And if we are to use kinetic theory in the reasoning for this physlet, does it seem in order based on the image of the container shown?Physlet 8.12.5   the container contains a gas (missing assumption: an ideal gas) that has work done on it in a straightforward isobaric process.Additional problem one.  Again, I had some trouble with the interface, but eventually I got it to work a bit, though I could not get the particles and temperatures to do what the physlet says it can do.  Increasing the running time beyond 15 seconds would allow for changes to actually reach equilibrium and make the physlet more interesting.Additional problem two.  Once I assumed that the units of temperature were Kelvin, I arrived at the same answer employing a simple plug-and-chug from a given formula.  The interactive aspect of this problem is negligible.  My question is:  how is this problem (and several of the others) any different than problems found in any general physics textbook?",3
2127,"This site appears to be comprised entirely of introductory physics problems centered around java applets.  The applets produce cartoons illustrating different concepts from introductory kinetic, and thermodynamic theory.  My first impression was that the site was a little long on cartoons and a little short on physics.  I believe that the argument for these physics related java cartoons (physlets) is that they build a sense of physical intuition in a more expedient fashion than does the traditional approach to physics education.  While I do certainly respect this argument I felt this site sacrificed too much of the traditional rigor and provided too little in return.  In its defense, the sight is an extension of an introductory physics text and when used in conjunction with this text it may well be quite illuminating.  As a stand-alone educational tool however I would not give it high marks.	Mechanically the site was well constructed and easy to navigate.  The only serious difficulty I found was in measuring objects in the animation frame.  Many of the problems call for the viewer to measure the physical dimensions of an object in the animation and I found this process to be somewhat onerous.  On all of the applets reviewed left clicking the mouse while the cursor is in the frame of the animation displays the x, y coordinates of the cursor.  This provided an effective but cumbersome means of measurement, and the only other option was to count the tiny grid lines.  Even using a 19-inch monitor, I found squinting at those tiny increments to be rather painful.   	The page I viewed linked to five problems and two additional problems below I review each of the first five in turn.Problem 1.Physical Principal Illustrated: the linear dependence of the thermal expansion of solids on the change in temperature. The Problem:	three animations depict a little stick expanding as the temperature rises from -50C to 0C (first animation),
 0C to 50C(second animation), and 50C to 100C (last animation).  All sticks have the same initial and final length.  The viewer is asked if the three sticks are all the same material.Review:	This problem was well crafted in that it illustrated the dependence of expansion on the change in temperature rather than the temperature its self (at least at this level of theory).  That being said I do have a fine point on which to quibble.  I personally would have replaced the phrase 'the same material' with 'the same average coefficient of linear expansion'.  Deciding that two items are comprised of the same material because they have similar thermal expansion characteristics seems somewhat analogous to deciding that a Ferrari is made of the same material as a red delicious apple because they are roughly the same color.Problem 2Physical Principal Illustrated:  The ideal gas lawThe Problem: 	A bubble rises from 5cm below the surface of the water to the surface of the water.  The viewer is asked to determine the ratio of final to initial temperatures.Review:	I would really like to see something like 'expands adiabatically' somewhere in the wording of this problem.  The time frame is 1 second and as such a lack of heat exchange with the water is probably a very good approximation.  Again this is a small point and in second semester physics the possible error due to heat exchange would never have never crossed my mind.  	I worked through this problem twice and I don't seem to be arriving at the same answer that is presented on the page.  The equation I derived was:	Tf/Ti = (Pf  rf^3)/(Pi  ri^3)Where T, P, and r represent the temperature,
 pressure and the radius of the bubble respectively, f indicates the final state and I indicates the initial state.  Using 101325 Pa and 101325 Pa + (density of H2O) (g) (h) for the final and initial pressures and the dimensions given yields 18.2 rather than the 13.6 listed on the site.  If I have made some error in mycalculations I would like to be informed of the fact so that I can write a retraction. I can be contacted at itc1@humboldt .edu.Problem 3Physical Principal Illustrated:  the characteristics of the ideal gas.The Problem:  Three animations are displayed.  The reader has to decide which animation is depicting an ideal gas.Review:	Vibrantly illustrates the internal properties of an ideal gas i.e. no interaction between particles, inter-particle distance is large with respect to particle size, and perfectly elastic collisions with the container walls.  This was probably the most educationally effective use of applets I found on this site.    Problem 4Physical Principal Illustrated:  the equal distribution of average kinetic energy in a gas at thermal equilibrium.The Problem:	A Big ball, a medium ball, and a little ball (colored red, yellow and green respectively) are depicted bouncing around with a bunch of other little balls (these balls are, of course, a representation of molecules in a gas).  The speed of each of the three colored balls is displayed in a separate chart.  The viewer is asked to decide which of the colored balls has the greatest average kinetic energy.Review: 	Very clever way to make the point: at equilibrium individual molecules in a gas will have the same average kinetic energy.  The only problem was estimating the average speed from the wildly erratic speed vs. time chart.Problem 5I am admittedly confused by this problem.  A container of gas decreases in volume,
 while both the pressure and temperature remain constant.  The viewer is asked to calculate the work done on the gas.  I can only assume that there is a gaping hole somewhere in the container or that the thermometer, and/or the pressure gauge is broken.  The prospect of solving a problem dealing with a non-closed system and/or erroneous measurements is somewhat more daunting than I would care to face in a freshman physics class.	In conclusion I wouldsay that this site certainly has some educational merit, but it by no means inspired me to trade in my freshman text books for a few mega-bytes of Java source code.   ",2
2127,"[8.12.1]:The applet demonstrated how a material expands with four different heat functions.

One thing left out, however, is a description of what the fuzzy region around the gas sphere is and how it's effects are (possibly) neglected in the model.[8.12.3]:This animation of different kinematic gas models would be very illuminating to one not familiar with the assumptions of the ideal gas law. The animations made it apparent (well, we knew what was coming beforehand actually!) that the correct model requires intermolecular spacing such that the molecules can be considered non-interacting. It ran well on challenged hardware.[8.12.4]:Quite an amazing simulation. A great demonstration about how mass is a factor in the concept of kinetic energy. But, there needs to be a way to easily extract data from the real time graph to work with the problem.[8.12.5]:This applet appears to have a serious error in that the pressure does not change in the animation as the volume drops and the temperature remains fixed.Additional Problems:1:A good applet to visualize the problem posed. All the extra numbers on the graph are not needed, however.2:Extremely slow running but very good applet that shows real time statistical kinetics and how average molecular speed can be found from seemingly random motion in a container.",4
2127,"This site was designed with an introductory college physics student in mind, and yet that is particularly the audience it would do the greatest diservice!  The physics behind the problems are left vague and sometimes even misleading.  This would only leave a student more confused and bewildered about the world of thermodynamics.  The benefits of Java applets are far outweighed by the poor design of this site.  I have outlined the problems the page poses to it's audience and a critique therof:Re: problem 8.12.1:It is extraordinarily difficult for a student to see the answer, stated so obvioulsy, because not only are the Java scripts slow and inexact, but also because the programmer chose to make the student view the rods expansion one at a time, instead of simultaneously.  As a result it would be virtually impossible for the student to measure each rod's length and calculate for themselves the conclusion, that all the rods are the same.Re: Problem 8.12.2:This Java applet is well-programmed, but the proceedure by which the author used to arrive at his conclusions are not well spelled out, leaving the students to wonder what assumptions were employed to reach his answer.  I personally could not find the route he took to reach the given answer of 13.6.Re: Problem 8.12.3:Unlike the previous two applets this one is surprizingly well done and instructive in that it gives the students a chance to not only see the behavior of an ideal gas in real time but it also gives them a chance to think crittically about how an ideal gas would behave compared to other gases.  My only critticism is that again it is not obvious how the author reached the conclusions he did,
 and the applet runs so slowly that it is difficult to see how interacting (or non-interacting the molecules are)Re: Problem 8.12.4:This applet is well done, and poses and interesting question to the students.  It shows the motion of three different size molecules and their respectivespeeds and asks, "" which has the greatest kinetic energy""  and replys that all three of them tie.  I like the fact that the problem was enginered such that the answer was not the obvious one, and makes the student realize that the kinetic energy is not just a fuction of speed, but also of mass.  I would reccomend that instead of displaying the instantaneous velocity of the particles that instead the applet would display the average velocity such that the student could realistically make the calculations.Re: Problem 8.12.5:I believe there is something broken in this java applet.  The animation implies that a container is decreasing in volume, yet maintaining a constant pressure and temperature!  This cannot be, so it's not only impossible for the student to arrive at the same answer, but it can be confusing to students who thought they understood compression and work, and now they see this animation that breaks all the rules!Additional Problem one:I enjoyed this applet, although it is VERY SLOW to run, and even slower after making the reccomended changes.  Despite the technical difficulties it is a wonderful illustration of the relationship between pressure and temperature, and a great reminder for early physics students about the meaning of equilibrium.Additional Problem Two:This last applet is instructive, but too difficult to use.  The question concerns a box of O2 molecules,
 where the individual speeds of the molecules are given.  It wants to know the average speed of all the molecules.  I suggest that instead of having to continuously average the speeds of the 20 molecules over the course of 20 seconds, the applet be reduced to somthing like 5 molecules.  By doing so it makes it feasible that a student could actually average the speeds and arrive at an answer.  Leave the mass computing to the computers!  ",2
2127,"It appears as though this Thermodynamics physlet is directed at undergraduate physics students who have had some education in classical thermodynamics. As an upper division undergraduate physics student, I found approximately 90 minutes to be sufficient time to work through the five problems presented in the tutorial. Most of this time is spent deciphering the mechanics of the user interface. That is, in answering the questions I found it generally difficult todetermine the spatial parameters required to answer the posed questions. Problem 2 serves as a good example in illustrating this point: The problem asks the user to find the ratio of two temperatures (final over initial) for an air bubble that rises through a tank of water. The air bubble originates at some distance below the surface of the water at which point an initial temperature isdefined. The bubble expands in volume as it rises to the surface of the water where it bursts. The final temperature of the air inside the bubble is defined at the time immediately before the bubble bursts. In finding the ratio of the final temperature to the initial temperature the student must recognize that the gas is essentially ideal and that it undergoes an expansion between the initial and final states. Some key insight is required here. The user essentially has two choices for paradigm: isothermal expansion or adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas. The isothermal expansion may be ruled out as no heat is added to the gas as it expands and cools. Thus, the user may decide on an adiabatic expansion paradigm and exploit the proper equations that follow from the first law and the ideal gas approximation; namely that (pressure)* (volume raised to the ratio of heat capacities) equals some constant. From this relationship one may then express the ratio of temperatures as a ratio of the respective pressure volume products at both the initial and final states.This is where determining the proper physical parameters becomes a little problematic. Namely,
 the user must determine the initial and final volumes of the bubble. The volume of a sphere is determined by its radius and so the user must somehow find the radius of the bubble at both states. This is possible if the user places the cursor at various points on the bubble to get the best estimate. This might not seem too tricky except that there are no suggestions or comments as to how to navigate through the animation. Some helpful comments might be in order that would facilitate this process so as to allow the user to spend less time on deciphering the interface and more time on the physics. This may be taken as a matter of opinion as one might argue that part of the problem solving here is figuring out how to get the information needed.On this note, I'll comment that the other problems are less cryptic in that any physical parameters or variables are much more easily determined. Problem 1, for example, only requires the user to determine expansion distances for several metal bars heated over some common time interval. These distances are easily determined as the metal bars are superimposed over a grid calibrated in centimeters. Thus, the user may easily draw some conclusion about the material composition of the metal bars based on the average rates of thermal expansion over some common time interval.Problem 3 is a rather straightforward multiple choice question. The user is presented with three different containers of gas. Of the three containers the user is asked to select the container of gas particles that most closely approximates the ideal gas. The particles vary in size and number from container to container. All that?s required to answer this question correctly is a working knowledge of what conditions are necessary for a gas to be considered ideal.Problem 4 is another working knowledge type question that doesn
?t require any calculations. The user is presented with graphics of  four different types of gas particles inside of a single container. The particles differ with respect to mass. Adjacent to the container is a plot of each type of particles kinetic energy vs. Time. The user then is asked to determine which of the particles has the greatest average translational kinetic energy.  The plot of kinetic energy vs. Time, however is not really required to answer this question. If the user remembers that average translational kinetic energy of a gas particle in a container is proportional to temperature only and not mass, then he may arrive at the correct answer. This particular presentation is a good example of a problem that tests a users understanding of  one of the more important consequences  of the kinetic theory of gases. In short it asks more of the user?s understanding of physics and less of his ability to decipher the interface.Problem 5 is a bit more difficult than Problems 1,3, and 4. It requires some calculations, specifically the use of integral calculus. The problem presents a rather textbook isothermal compression of  a gas. The graphics display  a mass on top of a piston. The user initiates the experiment and watches the piston do work on the gas as the mass falls downward due to the force of gravity. Throughout the experiment the user will notice thermometer measuring the internal temperature of the gas to the left of the piston. It?s easy to see that the temperature of the gas remains constant throughout the compression. Once the user has determined the process is isothermal he may then find the work of the gas by integrating the expression P*dV from the initial to final volumes. If the user assumes the gas to be ideal he may find an expression for the pressure in terms of volume from the ideal gas equation. Again some effort is needed in deciphering the graphics in determining the these volumes but  not as much as in Problem 2. In conclusion,
 this physlet might be best characterized as abrief homework assignment testing the users understanding of the more basic concepts in classical thermodynamics. Improvements could be made in the areas clarity in the statement of the problems and graphics. In the area of graphics, it should be mentioned that if the problem requires some insight into how to manipulate the interface so as to acquire any necessary data/information, there should be some suggestions as to how to get started. I think this can be done without giving the problem away.",3

2158,"An extensive and ambitious overview of the literature review writing process from question formation, to literature search, and synthesis and writing. Content is organized into major sections for each stage of the process and each major stage contains an overview (text), a short ""e-lecture"" and best of all a ""Faculty and student voices"" video.

The direct insights of the faculty and students were particularly compelling, and I was left wondering if these narratives might have been even more effective if they had been presented as contextualizing examples given in the flow of the e-Lecture tutorials.

I felt the content was very strong throughout, and that it also would have benefited from additional examples and, ideally, opportunities for the learner to self-check their understanding. For example, for some of the main points, could learners engage with contrasting examples in order to check their understanding? Self-checks and contextualizing examples like this would be compelling to explore as additions/extension activities.

From a usability perspective, I wondered if the image-based navigation picture, which appears in between the left-side navigation and the text-content was helpful.

2163,"I really liked the design of your StAIR!  It was very user-friendly.  Your instructions at the beginning prepared the user for what to expect during the resource.  The samples that you gave were very clear and seemed to go step by step to not overwhelm the student with too much information.  I might suggest having more examples before students practice problems on their own.  I noticed you had links to videos that taught the problems further at the first slide, as well as extra practice links at the end.  Maybe you could even add those links within the example problems so students can immediately get a few more examples?  This might be helpful for learners that need reinforcement before practicing independently.In terms of helping students as they practiced, in the first part of your tutorial I thought it was great how you would write the reason WHY a problem was wrong if students selected the incorrect answer.  I think that feedback is very valuable for the learner.  It was great.  I might suggest doing something similar to this for the “solve for x” portion.  You gave students what the “correct” answer would be, but maybe you could also include the step-by-step work for finding that solution.  It would be a way for students to see their mistake.  I am assuming that you probably expect students to take time to independently analyze how you got to the correct answer.  From my experience, unfortunately, some students who miss a problem get frustrated and want to move on.  Maybe seeing what they should have done would be helpful for the future problems.Overall, I felt like the “instruction” that was provided was very clear and easy to follow!  I especially liked the way you visually added bold lines to highlight sides or arrows to help students see visually how to look at the triangle.  I think these “small” details are actually very useful to the learner, and almost can’t be as clearly explained to students when we are teaching in a classroom.   I think it also was a good idea to “switch it up” between the two sections of your resource.  If all of the problems were multiple choice formats, I think the students would have become bored.  Instead, you switched it up and added great sound effects (but high school appropriate) to keep the students engaged.  Great job overall!Technical Remarks:The only thing that could maybe be altered would be your “click to start over” link.  When you actually do this at the end of the StAIR, all of the animations are already showing (with answers).

The display of (t,V) points would be more quantitatively useful if it showed only the actual values of V for a given t, and only when the mouse pointer is close to the plotted voltage curve.

2167,"Scolling through this website was not as fun as I thought it was going to be.  I was expecting more of this website as its name screams ""S.O.S."" though it was not much help to me.  It wasn't a complete lost as there are useful information but I felt that the information wasn't enough or complete for me personally.  I was hoping to use it as a resource or tool to help me more in my math studies and final, but it seems to lack a great deal of information.  The title does not seem as fitting.  I was a little disappointed in this site.  Perhaps those that are better in math would find this site more helpful and can use it as a refresher tool, but not for those like myself that needs more help in the math area.",3
2167,"I spent two hours browsing and reviewing my Algebra skills on this webpage and found it to be useful but that it didn't provide enough step-by-step detail for my needs. The topics are clearly outlined and the information was simplified, but it was difficult to interpret some of the content and figure out how the author came to some of their conclusions. This particular website would be good for someone who just needs a brief review of past Algebra material, but would not be a good source to refresh the concepts if you struggled in Algebra because there isn't quite enough detail and explanation.  First time users will find using the software easy to use because its straightforward and user-friendly.  What will be difficult is locating this website directly from the sub-categories provided by MERLOT.  It's easier to do a search on ""Algebra review"".",3
2168,"I'm not exactly sure what is considered an eportfolio on MERLOT but from this it looks sort of like a poster. I like the idea behind this work, unfortunately the sample size was small. I would love to see a follow up study if this was implemented the second year. ",4

2174,"Overall this STAIR was very easy to follow.  I liked that you could choose the path you wanted to take and I did not feel that is was overwhelming because it only had the three choices.  One problem I had right away was with the prior knowledge question.  If you clicked either ""yes"" or ""no"" for your answer, it said you were correct and took you to the same slide.  The purpose and objectives were stated at the begining, which I thought was nice to inform students what they would be learning about.  I also thought the scenarios were great examples to tie in the real world.  This STAIR contained mostly text and although it was nicely organized I thought it was too much.  When answering questions in the STAIR slides it gave feedback right away and provided help if you chose the wrong answer.  I also liked that in the Quizlet there was both multiple choice and written response questions.  I did not like that there was no information provided to help if you choose an incorrect answer.  I would think that because of all the information provided in the STAIR, it would be hard to answer the questions in the Quizlet correctly.",3
2174,"Positive Feedback: Multiple pathways presented in a way that allows student choice in the order of the lesson. Once on a path, the lesson is linear and easy to navigate through. The StAIR does a good job of activating and accessing prior knowledge with the question about people’s religious practices in the 13 colonies. The insertion of the Youtube video added to the multimedia nature of the StAIR concept. The Quizlet quiz did a good job of checking for understanding and provided excellent feedback in terms of correct answers and grade.Critical Feedback: More sounds and images could be used to engage the audience. There seem to be some missing gaps in the historical narratives of the two main characters’ lives. For example, how did an uneducated man become the president of a relatively prestigious school like Oberlin College? The StAIR made me think of this and other questions, but did not always answer questions. There were a few typos/grammatical errors in the StAIR. The Youtube video was somewhat long and did not hold interest because it was largely text based. The Quizlet did not allow for variance in correct answers. For example, when Garrison’s last name was provided the answer was marked wrong. Overall, the StAIR was extremely text based and provided few, if any, adaptations for students with language or vision impairments.Technical Remarks:Good embedding of Youtube and Quizlet links.  Image actions and sounds would have been helpful for interest and feedback.",3
2175,"I use these videos in my non-majors bio class.  Each video is around 10 minutes long and I typically use them as a discussion starter.  I have the students watch the video, we discuss the issue, and then that sets up the content covered in lecture.  I have also used these videos in an online class, where I have students discuss the issues as part of a discussion board.  Very nicely done, very topical, and they promote discussion amongst students.",5

2192,"I think the quality of content is good.  Its a hard concept for many high schoolers to understand.  Thinking about it reverse is an interesting and different way to come at this type of problem.  As someone who considers themselves good wtih Math, I would tend to want to skip ahead and pick answers to just ""get done"" with it, since the program allowed me to do that.   If its used as an introductory activity and I had no prior knowledge , I would find this extremely confusing...not enough visuals for me as someone who learns that way.   I was getting lost in all the words, with no way to remember what problem I was on( unless you are requiring them to write it down as a grade).It was very easy to use, with no major technical difficulties. There was one problem that talked about solving for ""y"" but I never saw a ""y"" in the question.  I think it was the one that said -9x+5=53.  Assuming this was new material to me, I would have been very frustrated.I think graphics would have added to the presentation and understanding for all learners.",3
2192,"What can I say.  Old dog, new tricks.  I found this method very interesting but hard to grasp.  I think I played it about 4 times and still had some difficulties.  It is hard to unlearn the traditional method of problem solving that I have used for the last 30 years.  Is this something new that you came up with, or is this a varient of how they teach solving for x nowadays?  If this is something you came up with, this is sweet.  Different ways to solve the same problems is the best way to reach as many of the learners as possible.  Hats off, and I'll raise you a star for inginuity.  However, I think you might want to take it slow, and use baby steps.  I started to twitch on the last problem.  If this is one of the newer ways to teach this topic, well, I suppose I should just sit back down and try not to hurt myself. That being said, It is a well thought out and well put together lesson,I just all that confident with the topics and tactics in a couple of places.The only other thing that I might suggest is to put a little flavor into it.  This is just my opinion, but I like to offer the viewer a bit of fun when navigating.  Throw some clip art in, some sound files, maybe something on the visually silly side to lighten things up.  I did like the whole regurgitation thing.  That will wake them up. Technical Remarks:No real technical issues.  There were a couple slides that I wanted to go back on, but the buttons were not available.  It was during the question and answer section where we were suppossed to write the equation down.  I thought I had the right answer, I answered wrong and I wanted to see the equation again.  Then at the end there was no end button.  The show just looped around to the beginning and started again.",3
2193,"This way of solving equations was quite interesting. Learning how to solve the equations by just simply balancing out the equation by putting the right numbers on the right side and adding and subtracting the problem made it a breeze. I would definitely recommend this program or ""method"" to anyone who has problems solving Linear Equations.",4
2194,"Things Done Well:Nice use of many different quadratic examples!  It is great if the students get the questions incorrect that you show them how to 'start' the problem, and continue the answer further, if they need more assistance.Nice use of the fading in of examples, along with the timing of the next button, so the students could not skip over the examples.Things that could be added/corrected:I think that it would have been nice if the video was embedded in the StAIR (but I was also having problems doing this!)It would have incorporated more UDL requirements if it had had some voice over some where throughout the presentation.The you trys were a little confusing because they didn't actually have you ""try"" you watch the example but then they had examples later for you to ""try"" Technical Remarks:Nice use of power point kiosk!  Some the links were not visible if I had made a ""mistake"" on the questions (the answers were not visible on all of the links)",3
2194,StrengthsGood examples and textual explanations of the concept.Strong instructional scaffolding.Provided user feedback when links were present and functioning.WeeknessesWhat should the students be looking for in the video?Does not meet UDL principles for most of the lesson.

2196,"Teresa Madyun’s Stair Design: Solving Two-Step Equations, Solving Multi-Step Equations is a “drill and practice” type of instructional resource written for 9th grade alternative education math students. This stand-alone instructional resource is straightforward and easy to use. It would be effective when used for its intended purpose as a source of additional practice or review in preparation for a test. In addition to the practice examples presented, the author provides a hyperlink to an on-line game called Hoopshoot which challenges students to solve two-step equations. The link to this game worked fine, however, when I clicked on it, I was then “kicked out” of the PowerPoint. It would be better to put this slide at the end of the PowerPoint so there would be no need for the user to reopen the presentation. One of my favorite parts of the StAIR was in the author’s selection of audio positive reinforcement for correct answers. These were “laughing out loud” moments for me and I’m sure would also be fun for students! I would have liked to see some “reteaching” on the slides for incorrect answers and the submission to MERLOT could be improved on by providing a more detailed description of the lesson plan as well as an accompanying graphic.",5
2196,"I navigated through the presentation easily and found it to be very engaging. Categorizing it as drill and practice seems appropriate. I added a new math resource to my bookmarks as well: math-play.com. Thanks. The slide transitions and feedback help motivate the user forward. The examples were appropriate. However, I couldn’t get the video solutions to play. I thought the game links were fun and appropriate. I could see myself getting distracted and practicing too long. I liked the variety of instructional techniques, including paper and pencil to solve the quiz questions. I would suggest adding some audio instructions the slides to assist students with reading difficulties.Technical Remarks:I could not get videos to play.",4
2197,"If it weren't for all of the technical errors, I would recommend this StAIR because I LOVE Google Docs.  There are a few things (listed below) that need to be tweeked on this presentation but other than that it seems like it could be a very fun, interactive and useful tool to use in the classroom.  I liked how the students follow along with the presentation to do a practice Google Doc.  The objectives were listed at the beginning so students knew what they were going to be learning about and it also included some screen shots which were helpful as well.  The whole concept was based on a tool that uses technology.  For pedagogy, the StAIR used different learning styles such as reading, communicating, and hands on.  The content of this StAIR was good but it would have been better if the videos worked.  If I could add one thing to this StAIR it would be some quiz questions where the students could click the answer on the screen so that they could have some instant feedback and remediation if necessary.  I think that a StAIR is something students do that doesn't require any type of supervision or external guidance.  Especially without the videos, this StAIR seemed like it would not be a stand ALONE instructional resource.   If I could change two things, I would make the forward navigation arrows be timed so they don't show up for at least five seconds so the student can not simply click trhough the whole presentation without reading it and the other thing I would do would be to fix all of the technical errors.Technical Remarks:There were quite a few technical errors in this presentation.  It did not open in Kiosk mode which means that anyone who opened this presentation from Merlot could modify it however they wanted.  However, I was lucky that it was editable because when I got to the second slide, there was no forward or backward arrow to I was stuck on the page.  I had to go in and edit the page so I would be able to move on to the next one.  None of the videos worked.  There is no link where it says ""print out quiz from the following link."" and the quiz answers slide does not have any answers on it.",3
2197,"This is a good learning experience for students. It involves higher level thinking, hands on practice and communication between students.

2215,"This StAIR is engaging and well designed. The content is presented in through the use of both audio and visual, scaffold to build on prior knowledge, and appropriately focused toward primary students. The heavy vocabulary on the slides could prove to be a hurdle for many primary users and in that way I think it takes a great instructional resource and knocks it down to a good stand-alone instructional resource.   While I do not have the opportunity to use this in a classroom to assess its effectiveness, I cannot believe that primary users would be able to get the full benefit of such a great design with the navigation and vocabulary standing in the way. Having said that, it’s a great design for a slightly older audience and the use of the embedded video (counting by 5) adds to its strength. While I loved that there was teacher interaction through the recorded audio, from a UDL perspective I would have liked to see captions for students with impaired hearing. Again, because this isn’t just a lesson plan but a stand-alone resource, accessibility to information is key for students.Technical Remarks:All the technical aspects of this document functioned properly. No links were broken and all of the embedded media worked.",4
2215,"This is a very high quality resource. It is intended for young elementary children as they learn to tell time. The overall product design features child-friendly images, directions, and language. Graphics also help highlight and emphasize key concepts.Instructional strategies featured in this resource support learning. For example, when students are asked to practice counting by fives, scaffolding is provided by allowing students to click on an audio clip that they can count along with. Audio clips that read directions or text aloud to students are also featured on some slides. This supports developing readers, auditory learners, and English language learners. This feature can also be used as an assistive technology for students with special needs, which is vitally important when working to plan lessons according to Universal Learning Design. To improve this learning material, audio could be included on every slide to provide consistent support throughout use of the resource.This resource also encourages students to connect new concepts to their lives. Text on several slides encourages learners to compare time-telling to recess and lunch – ideas that are very significant to students!At several points, students have opportunities to show what they are learning by answering questions. Instant feedback is given based on their responses – they are either directed to a motivating celebratory slide, or to a slide to reteach the concept. This immediate feedback greatly benefits learners.Another strength of this resource is that it offers additional resources that would appeal to multiple intelligences – specifically, embedded videos of animated songs are used to reinforce concepts, and links to external websites featuring activities are used to practice skills.One thing to note is that this resource includes a great deal of information and may quickly become overwhelming to students who are not yet confident in the topic. I believe it would best be used after students have already had some exposure to time-telling concepts – perhaps as support while students review a concept in the later part of teaching the topic.Technical Remarks:I did not have any technical issues while using this resource. All links and buttons work properly.",5
2216,"The weblink takes the user to the a list of articles that are available online from the Coalition of Essential Schools.  The 10 Common Principles is one of those documents.

Students could use these tools in the field to learn more about schools and the principles.Technical Remarks: Since these are all PDF documents, users will need to have the Adobe Acrobat plugin with their web browser, and students need to be properly advised.  Fortunately, none of the download times for the documents are very long.",5

Apart of the fact that it was fun and educational it is extremely easy to use.  <",5
2219,It gives a good representation of theorum form.It shows specific examples on how to apply to applications. It has great illustrations on material on learning theorum forms. Technical Remarks: great teaching tool,4
2219,"I enjoyed this site very much.  Maybe if my 7th grade geometry teacher had used this tool when teaching us, I might have understood.  I am a visual hands on person, I learn best that way.  I spent about 15 minutes playing with all the various applets on this website - thales circle, pythagorean theorem.  Shows formulas, types of triangles, circles, lots of graphics.  Whole program was very easy to use and educational but need more instructional information. Site seems to assume that you already have the basics of geometry down, which is why I think it would be great used in conjunction with geomtery class.  Site also reviews trigonometry and complex numbers. Technical Remarks: No technical problems.",5
2219,"I SPENT A 20 MINTUES PLAYIN WITH ALL THE ANNIMATIONS. THALES CIRLCE I JUST FOOLED AROUND WITH THE ANIMATION TRYING TO ADJUST THE SEMICIRCLES IN DIFFERANT ANGLES. THEN I LOOKED THROUGH DIFFERANT APPLETS. THE MATERIAL IS COOL BASICALLY BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE ANIMATIONS AND SEE HOW THE DIFFERANT ANGLES,TRIANGLE CIRCLES ECT.... WORK. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE INSTRUCTION TO IT AND LITTLE EXPLANATION BECAUSE I JUST MOVED THE MOUSE THE AROUND REALLY NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. I THINK IS THIS IS TAUGHT TO STUDENTS BY THE TEACHER THE STUDENTS CAN BE GREATLY ENHANCED. THE STRUDENT CAN GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE ANIMATIONS BETTER. AS A FIRST TIME USER I THINK ITS VERY COOL TO USE THE MOUSE TO PLAY WITH ANIMATIONS, BUT YOU HAVE LOOK AT THE SITE KNOWING SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT . ",3
2219,"I spent approximately 1 hour reviewing the material at this site.  I used one of the applets (Thales Circle) for mathematics methods classes.Quality of ContentExcellent!  I first saw this when I was searching for information on Thales Circle (James Stigler, The Learning Gap, mentions an eighth grade teaching/learning episode on Thales Circle.).  Potential EffectivenessThese animations provide a semi-concrete experience for students.  If students just watch the animations, the students will not be helped much toward understanding the concept/principle being presented.  If students take the next step and do the exercises themselves, those students' own understanding should be greatly facilitated.  Also, this site would be good for expanding teachers' ideas of how to present the lessons to their own students.If lesson plans accompanied these applets, this site would be great for teachers to use.""This item is currently under review by the Teacher Education Editorial Board."" 7Technical Remarks:Ease of UseFirst time user would have to know about dragging and how to use interactive learning objects.  Requires level-4 (or higher) Java-enabled browser.Delay:  http://home.a-city.de/walter.fendt/me/anglesum.htmThe coloring (red) is very slow to cover the marked angle.  This could interfere with students' understanding at first.",5

2221,"I spent 30 minutes reviewing the website. The information provided helps the reader to identify the CMM levels, associate key process process areas and practices with the different levels, and identify features that are common among the levels.  The material was written in a language that was easy to understand.  It really did help to better understand what the CMM really is.",5
2222,"The teach/quiz/review format looks like an excellent way to either present or review the Chemistry of Life Unit; from atoms to molecules to the four macro molecules, Lipids, Carbohydrates, Nucleic Acids, and Proteins.Technical Remarks:Material is supposed to be a power point but I am having trouble using the file on my XP desktop. ",4
2222,"This easy to use Stair is a great introduction to the Chemistry of Life.  Even though there were many words on there which I did not understand, the content was clearly described and I came out better informed.  The addition of a navigation page at the beginning and navigation buttons throughout made the PPT easy to access.The review quizzes were well done and worked well.  Links are provided along with quizzes in order to encourage students not to take wild guesses but review if needed.The overall feel and look of the PPT was quite agreeable. The learning objectives should be met well with this Stair.To make this product even better, I could suggest the use of a short video introducing the topic, prompting students to activate prior knowledge. Technical Remarks:At 2.2MB it was fast and easy to download.  However, since I was accessing the PPT on a Mac, some of the action buttons do not work.  I was not able to watch the included video.",5
2223,I spent about thirty minutes reviewing the material. I thought that this website was very educational to both students and teachers. The material was really interesting.Technical Remarks: This website was very easy to navigate through. ,5
2223,1.  I spent about 15 minutes looking around the site. 2.  I think that the quality of the site is good. It has factual information and be educationally significant.  This is the best site I have seen on child psychology 3.  I think that if this site was used appropriately that it could enhance teaching and learning because it is very informational.Technical Remarks:This site was easy to use and it was my first time at this site.,4
2223,"This was one of the best sites I have found on child psychology.  There was extensive information on childhood disorders ranging from ADD to Downes Syndrome and included information on testing, advocacy, legal aspects, and treatments.I spent about an hour going through this site.  The material was very thorough, well written and easy to comprehend.  This site would be an ideal resource for many students and faculty members.  I expecially appreciated the legal and advocacy section.  This was the first time I have seen this subject covered in such a comprehensive fashion.Technical Remarks: This site was very easy to navigate.  Moving from section to section was smooth and all of the links functioned as they should.  ",5
2223,"This a interesting site that teaches the user in a simplified format. I read about several disorders I had known about and  learned about some that I had never heard of before. The disorders Spina Bifida which is a defect that results in cleft or mishapen spine that sometimes protrudes out of the victims back and can cause serious physical limitations that can only be corrected with a series of surguries. I also leaned about the disorder Prader-Willi syndrome which prevents proper muscle development, causes an over active appitite that can lead to over eating and obesity, learning disabilities, and some behavioral problems. Technical Remarks: The site is set up in a simple way that makes it easy to navigate and locate informnation. Unlike many sites that are congested with tons of information and numerous links, this site keeps it small and simple.",3
2223,I found this site to be very informative and it was full of information relating to children. Alot of the information was stuff I never thought possible.,4
2223,"I reviewed the materials on the site for approximately one hour.  The site has alot of information and accessible resources for assistance.  Dr. Rene Thomas Folse is both a licensed psychologist and Attorney at Law in California.  Her legal expertise provides a valuable resource.  The website provides treatment, resources and remediation information.  There is even information about how to become a ""Child Psychologist"".Technical Remarks: The site menu is all on the first page which makes it very easy to navigate through.  One negative comment is that some of the specific disorders were last updated in 1997or 1998.  Dr. Folse does provide her email for comments.  ",3
2223,This website definitely has a VAST amount of information! I'll probably book mark it - as it may be helpful in the future. good choice. keep up the good work.  ,5
2223,I thought this web site had a lot of useful information.  It is very educational ofr women who are planning to have children becuase it gives them an idea of what can effect their child.Technical Remarks: This website is easy to navigate with clearly marked and functional links.,4
2223,"This is a phenominal site. If you are interested in becoming a special education teacher, or have a child with a disability this site is for you!

2223,"I spent around 20 minutes reading through this site.It is very informative on several childhood conditions such as;ADD, cerebral palsy, autism,epilepsy, down syndrome, and so on. It also discusses advocacy for the child, psychological testing, and resources and services.If one is searching any of these topics, this site has a great deal of knowledgable information. Technical Remarks: This site is very easy to use, the topic headings are clearly marked and the links are all available.",5
2224,"In my experience, the Compleat Lexical Tutor is one of the more powerful online resources for teaching and learning English vocabulary. There are any number of tools on the site to benefit both instructors and students, including concordancers, frequency and grammar checkers, quiz and test builders, etc., all of which can be used together with established English language corpora (such as Brown) and word lists (such as the Academic Word List). As an instructor, I have taken most advantage from the easy-to-use cloze passage builder, as well as the ""Text Lex Compare"" option, which compares the frequency of words in a text of any length with a chosen corpus. One other positive and attractive feature of the site is its continuous updates--in the two years that I have been making use of this resource, teaching and learning tools have been added regularly.

Possibly the only downsides to the Compleat Lexical Tutor are that 1) it does not place a high priority on attractive physical layout and 2) it might not be immediately or obviously user-friendly to students. Instructors with some training in vocabulary teaching will benefit from the resource, but untrained instructors and especially ESL/EFL students will most likely require guided overview of targeted tools before using them on their own.Technical Remarks:There is a stated requirement of Internet Explorer 5 and above, though those users of Firefox will find the Mozilla browser equally compatible.",5
2225,"This material is telling us about the diamond theory and how to realize the different puzzle and surfaces of diamond with different cutting. According to it, we can make 322,560 pairs of patterns.Technical Remarks:I like the technique because I can change the different look of pattern by myself",5
2226,the nobel prize site is a great resource! This is a great game to test the student's knowledge of the base pairing rules.,5
2226,"This game makes learning about DNA fun and interactive. It reminds me of Space Invaders from ""Atari"". The best part is that you actually get to learn Science from this game.",5
2227,I couldn't get this site to work. :o(,1
2228,"The third Merlot link I came upon was one desinged by author Russell Schwager. Schwager?s webpage entitled ?How Does The Enigma Work?? For those who are history buffs, the Enigma Machine (which has a strong resemblance to a typewriter) was the device that the Third Reich employed to send and receive coded messages, during WWII (more recently, the Enigma machine was prominently shown in the fictional WWII films ?Das Boot? and ?U-571?). For years the Enigma Code played havoc with the Allies and their ability to crack and be capable of deciphering the encoded messages. One man, Alan Turing, is credited with near genius for his successful efforts in cracking the Enigma Code. The arrogant Germans were over confident in their technology and never realized that their machine and Enigma codes had fallen into the hands of the Allies. Consequently, the Allies were enabled to keep track of all the German orders, field commands, and troop deployment and positions. The curious feature about Schwager webpage is that a workable applet (facsimile) is displayed which allows the viewer to work with the machine as it was employed during the war. Another nice feature about Schwager webpage is its detailed explanation of how all the components, ?a plug board, a light board, a keyboard, a set of rotors, and a reflector (half rotor) [were] used in the machine.? Of particular note was that this machine happens to function quite similarly to our Math G discussion of the algebra ?input and output? diagram. There are several other links that offer the viewer the history I encapsulated here, along with multiple links to the Polish Academic Information Center,
 Bletchly Park, A Story on the Breaking of the Enigma Machine, UK Science site with a whole section devoted to Code-breaking, Another Enigma simulator, Code and Ciphers in WWII, The Code War, JHU?s Cryptology Class, The Enigma Exhibit at the NSA Museum, Making Magic, U-Web, The U-BoatWar 1939-45, The Enigma, More on the Enigma, and Think Quest Entry on Encryption. Encryption has been with humankind for thousands of years. But for those of us living in the Twenty-first century encryption is common place, in fact, it is ubiquitous; from military applications, to protecting intellection property (think Microsoft and its current OS: XP), and computer privacy (for example, making a purchase online with a credit card). On Schwager's webpage I read for a couple of hours (made use of several links) about encryption and the complex mathematical calculations that are routinely used in everyday software and internet usage, and toyed with the cipher applet as instructed (which I found fascinating). For students who envision becoming programmers, Schwager webpage hosts detailed information about how the encryption process is addressed and employed throughout the world; therefore, I suspect this somewhat historical as well as current application usages would be of benefit for math students and their instructors for in-class discussions, and I can not perceive an instance wherein this webpage would not enhance any classroom environment. Schwager's webpage appeared to me as having the highest quality content of the three I have visited thus far. Properly employed by an instructor, I think that a student?s knowledge of said subject would be immeasurably enhance, because there is the Enigma applet itself (how it worked),
 multiple links that accord consideration of history, applications, and instruction of the mathematical processes (concepts laid down with easily comprehendible language). Overall, I was rather impressed, and did enjoy having my knowledge expanded considerably (I like to understand how things work and their relationships in the real world). My overall evaluation of the Schwager webpage, its design and function, should not challenge anyone with the most basic knowledge and experience with computersand the internet.",5
2228,"It is an attractive applet that does a great job in implementing the Enigma cipher. It has plenty of options that can be fully used.From the learning standpoint, the author did a reasonable job in providing some explanation on how the cipher works, how the applet can be used, and also history about the cipher. Unfortunately, it does not look like a standalone teaching tool. The descriptions are rather sketchy and force you to find better sources of information (some provided as links). However, nice visual display, looking close to the real machine.Technical Remarks:No difficulties in running the applet (done it on Win2000 / IE5). On the accuracy of the implementation I have only one comment. It seems that the plugboard allows a connection to the same node (i.e. connect A to A). Although this really does not make any difference, it is not fully accurate to the original method. In addition, since each letter can belong to only one connection, having a copnnection to itself makes the node unusable.",4
2228,"What hooked me on this site was the name ""Enigma"" and ""code breaker"". The page begins with a model of the machine and it was fun to type out an encrypted message. An explanation follows, along with a description of its components, a brief history, and links to more sites loaded with information. The best link was ""The Story on the Breaking of the Enigma Machine Code"", which is an 8-part story about Joe Desch, the NCR engineer, who developed the machine to break the Nazi's codes.The story recounts how, in 1942, he designed and manufactured high-speed electronic counters for the code breaker machines at NCR contributting to war effort. The machines relied on gas tubes ,which he invented, for computations. By using three rotors, a plug board, keys, and a display board, the number possible for each letter was 10^23 for three rotors or 10^26 for four rotors. WOW!Interestingly enough, these same electronic counters were sent to the Manhattan Project. Much more information about the enigma machines was recently declassified, in 1992, by former President Clinton.This is a fascinating retelling of how this information was discovered by Joe Desch's daughter.Technical Remarks: It was very easy to navigate around the site and to visit other hyperlinks. I wish there were more demonstration encrypted messages to practice with or instructions on how to set the rotors, plug board, and key strokes to simulate the decoding process. ",5
2228,"I was rolling the dice on this assignment. I asked a friend to pick a number for the page, and a number for the material. I had no clue on what the Emigma Machine was, but as I read along it was very interesting. This machine was a simple cipher that was used in the WW II by the Germans for military messages, and it look simular to a typewriter. The machine has several variable settings, for operation. When a key is is pressed an electrical current is sent and becomes an encrypted letter.Well the whole encryption process for contains a minimum of 7 remappings and a max of 9 remappings.The effectiveness was cool, there was a lot of material and history behind the information. Yes the information given was easy to understand and thorough .",5
2229,"It worked well, took a small bit of time to read through all the typing/explainations of everything.  Graphics were clear and user friendly.",3
2230,"I spent about a half and hour browsing the information on this website and I found it to be extremely useful and interesting.  I went to some of the different topics it had to offer and looked at what some of the pages had to offer.  As a math student, like myself it was a relief to see that there is an actual website that acknoledges that math mistakes are being made in politics, the media and in our everyday lives.  This website can be a great educational tool for students becuse students can learn from the math mistakes that are being made daily in the media and elsewhere.  This website is also a useful math education tool because students might see mistakes that they have made and recognize them on the website and then learn how to correct the mistake.  If students and teachers used this tool in the classroom it would show that it is not just math students who make math mistakes but also people in the media who we can tend to look to for the right answers.  This website can enhance teaching and learning by showing studnets common math mistakes and how to fix them and by showing teachers that math is not perfect and teaching the students that many misconceptions in math.  I found this website to be visually appealing and easy to use.  As a first time user I had no trouble navigating through the website.  The homepage on the website was clear and it made it easy to decide what information I wanted to learn more about.  This website is user friendly to first time and return users.  ",4
2231,"The depth and breadth of the information is well done and still relevant today.  However, the information is somewhat dated as it was written in 1999 and much has been done in the subsequent seven years with technology, accessibility and standards.  The organizations referenced do exist but some of the methods and technology have been greatly improved upon.",4
2232,"I was able to read much of the material, from start to finish in about an hour or so. There is quite a bit more information from the past right up to recently if you wish to spend more time. Just before I quit the session I did the ""put in your year of birth to find out what happened then"" & found even more detailed information. I could spend hours & hours here but, alas, I have people to see, places to go & only so much time to spend on this. The content is excellent. I would recommend some spellchecking...The history presented here is interesting & easy to read. Most high school & college students will understand & enjoy this site. Teachers might find it useful material as they could present parts of it in their own presentations. There is really no math here which makes it even easier for me to follow! All in all, I found the experience to be positive and informative.",5
2233,I like this video. the animations were great and it put things in persoective such as space and time. I do wonder where the information was gathered from though. ,3
2233,"It was a well made video of the current theories, but a little difficult to follow at times. I do take some exceptions with your comment about the video. First, the scientific community is far from unaminous about evolution, and if you try to tell kids in school that religions are all wrong, the PTA will have you drummed out in a heart beat. It is not your job to express your religious views to someone else's children. When teaching evolution, it is important to remind people it is a theory, not a fact or law. Evolution goes against the law of entropy. Many scientists believe in divine design along with natural selection. It is up to everyone to make up their own minds.",3
2233,"The best astronomy/evolution video that I have ever seen! More gripping, entertaining, and informative than the Fantasia version. I plan to show this to my 5-year-old twins at least once per year until high school, and plan to incorporate this into my Jr. High science classes as well.",5
2234,1.  Time Spent:  15 minutes of browsing the site and following links.2. Content:  The content does not really give the user enough information about the ICON programming language to give you a feel for what to do and how to do it.  It does not give compelling reasons for using this language or how it is better than more standard languages.  Links often lead you to either a dead end and do not provide you with a way to get back to your starting point.3. Enhanced Learning:  Unless this language is a part of a program of study of various languages it does not seem to provide additional skills for a programming course.4. Ease of Use:  The site mentions various text editors and attempts to give the user information about how to use them and their differences but fails to explain where to get them.

This is a lesson which can be easily converted to various age groups and for any destination needed to cover in the curriculum. If I were a fourth grader, I think this would be a really fun assignment to do. Nicely done.Technical Remarks:This lesson only requires basic programs that can be found on any school's computers, thus making it useful to most school applications.",5
2249,"As a fourth grade teacher I think that this is an outstanding lesson for this age group. This is a high interest lesson plan, it utilizes several different technologies, Google Earth, Power Point, Google Docs, as well as taking screen shots, completing research and putting together a presentation to be shared with peers. By allowing students to create their own individualized tour of Italy you are not only giving them control over how this project plays out, you are also giving them an unique sense of ownership over the final project that is not always possible in a classroom. If students had the basic background knowledge of using a word processing document and power point I believe that the other skills would come naturally after some demonstrations and practice.Technical Remarks:I think that this would be an easy lesson to implement. The only difficulties might be the speed of downloads and internet searches due to the age of the computers at school.",5

2265,I feel these training tools will be helpful in developing self-development workshops for the adult learner in any materal content levelsTechnical Remarks:Easy to access and navigate,4
2266,"It`s amazing how telomeres can explain our natural life clock. In this way, the replication series ""destroy"" the full extended chromosomic DNA. So, flies can live longer with incorporation of telomerase. This fact becomes to a long list of studies about ""eternity"" life and substances for skin maintance.Technical Remarks:Good video. Easy explanation of the DNA machine.",4
2267,This applet would be a good idea if the explanation was more closely tied to the applet.  As it stands I had a hard time understanding what was happening.,3
2268,"Nice graphical depiction of transverse and longitudinal waves.  As with some other applets, the largest amplitude of the wave didn't appear to correlate with the highest density of the gas.",4

2270,"I found your STAIR to be very thorough and quite challenging for me as I have not done trigonometry for about 15 years!I thought it was a little word heavy at the start which put me off a bit. I don't know if the HS students need to know all the information in the second and third slide. I would probably slim it down to the bare essentials. With UDL in mind I would have included some more audio feedback or assistance for learners who require that sort of instruction. But it was very much along the lines of UDL with the inclusion of a calculator and glossary to aide the learners with multiple means of representation. There were multiple means of expression with the different levels of quiz also.Design wise, I felt the colors were a little muted; the quiz and home icons got a little lost with their size and color.Overall, your students will be lucky to have this as a learning aide with such a tricky aspect of Math! They can take control of their learning and use it home to go over issues in their own timeTechnical Remarks:Nothing to note.",4
2270,"Your StAIR is very easy to use and to navigate.  This helps the learner to not be intimidated while learning a lesson on Trigonometry.  Adding a page for standards is a great way of communicating to the student the value of learning the skills after completing the StAIR.  I think it is a great approach having a quiz at three skill levels.  The way you presented the concept is very effective, I may suggest to give more practical and visual examples where we can use these concepts.  I saw at the end of your page there is a .pdf page quiz with practical questions.  If a student decided to print this out and solve the problems, an answer key page would be nice to verify his answers. Please correct me if I’m wrong, there were a couple of pages with Copyright marks from Holt, Rinehart and Winston.  You may have already verified its terms and conditions of use, but just in case, it’s always a good idea to make sure it’s acceptable to distribute these pages online. You might also want to add a short note for the user to download and save the StAIR on their computer, then open it from where they save it.  If the user directly opens the StAIR on MERLOT and clicks on the online calculator the calculator doesn’t open in a new window. It changes the current ""quiz"" window to the calculator causing the user to have to use the back button to return to the quiz. Overall, this is a well-put together StAIR.",5
2270,Great lesson! Thanks for submitting.,5
2271,The tutorial creates a useful resource for teachers. The screen shots with directional arrows makes it easy for the user to identify the areas to which reference is being made in each instance. The downloadable template with guidelines for each frame is easy to use and will be a time saving device for those who want a ready made template for their class. It is interesting that the free template provides some idea about the ease of template creation for those who might be timid to embrace this technology.,4
2272,i really liked this site.Technical Remarks: i browsed this site for about 10 minutes.  its content was informative and very easy to follow.  ,4
2273,"A good idea, with nice graphics.   The applet suffers from the lack of versatility.",3
2274,Having the two motion frames available makes this applet better than the usual.,4
2275,"There is a lot of valuable information in USA's Online Learning Laboratory (OLL). This is definitely a site to be enjoyed in pieces. One of the great things about the site is that the layout makes it easy to use. The layout is clean with clear buttons and links. There is even a QR scanner to access the site from a mobile device. I did not review all of the site, so I picked the topics that were of most interest to me. I love the eLeader series, which allows a visitor to quickly target and easily find strategies on using different technologies. The pictures of the faculty sharing these strategies reduced the transactional distance that can be problematic in learning. I would like to see some updated content on some of the pages. For example, the Redesign Academy has the schedule from Summer 2010. While these advertised sessions seem to be internal to USA, it would look better to remove or update the date. Another example is Producing Podcasts. There could be content added, a link to the How To Guides, or at least an email for contacting someone within the OLL. The How-To Guides are an excellent feature and a very practical way to help faculty gain comfort in producing their own multimedia pieces. I liked the idea of the Research Rundown as a quick source of scholarly support for reluctant faculty or anyone! The latest research cited under Multimedia is from 2006, and under Distance Learning from 2009, so there are opportunities to update the evidence for reluctant instructors. Or, perhaps there aren't any more of those at USA! There is so much to appreciate at the site that I will be sure to return to it, and probably use some of its materials, in my instructional design courses.",4
2275,"I lingered at this web resource a long time.  It is bookmarked and I will return.  Well worth a visit and spending some time viewing the good resources for teaching and learning online.Technical Remarks:Could navigate fairly well, all the links I perused opened for me.  Some really good sites are accessed through this online laboratory.",4
2276,"I spent aobut 30 minutes reviewing a number of the links provided on the website.  While the focus was primarily on website design, a number of the concepts can be carried over to a traditional application.The quality of the content varies since this website is a collection of websites, each written and maintained by different people.  As expected, some websites are better than others and it does take some time to find the ones worth readingThis website is easy to use since it is basically a collection of URLs, categorized by subject.",4

2285,"Very nice! A lot of good ideas and things to do in a linear algebra class and other classes too.  The Gaussian elimination program is excellent.  There are also some more complicated processes included that most sites do not bother to attempt.Technical Remarks:It is a little difficult to understand the nature of the material from just the title.  Perhaps, now that you have so many wonderful topics, it is time for some indexing and collection organization.  Thank you for a great set of materials.",4
2286,The site was easy to access and it provided a lot of information.Technical Remarks: It was effective to my learning and it was also fun to read.,4
2286,The site was very interesting. The material was broke down to make it easier to understand. The activities where very good with lots of color and visual effects.Technical Remarks: The material was well done. The site ran very well and the effects where good.,5
2286,"As a college freshman, I found the The Internet Psychology Lab to be an entertaining theme park of interactive illusions and experiments.  Three of the four main topics--audio perception, visual perception, and cognition--took you on a fascinating journey into the world of perception and illusion.The interactive illusion demonstrations were fascinating, stimulating, mind boggling, and, for the most part, fun.  However, when clicking on the ""selective adaptation"" link accessed from the visual perception category, I must warn those who are susceptible to migrain headaches to be careful.  This one is an eye shocker.  The graphics may trigger a migraine.  Since black and white images zing my eyes, and, yes, trigger migraines, I did not review this section further.Also, those who suffer from motion sickness, do not go into motion parallax!!!  This section is reserved for you daredevils!  It looks great and fun; however, I get dizzy riding in the back seat, so I quickly exited this section without hesitation.Now, remember, the main link from Merlot will take you directly to the ""visual perception"" page, only; if you want to visit the other three main topics: auditory, cognition, and memory (this one is currently under construction)--you need to click ""home"" at the bottom of the page.  This will give you access to the previously mentioned links.  And from this home page--Internet Psychology Lab--you can find access to several other sources offering illusional and perceptional sites.So go for it, guys.  Take a tour of this site and be prepared to stimulate your eyes!But,
 remember, this site is not only fun, it has a wealth of information incorporated within each section that is highly educational, and extremely useful for both student and faculty.Graphs, charts, diagrams, interactive experiments, research data; it's all in there.Be prepared to spend a lot of time navigating this site.  I spent over an hour there, and did not even scratch the surface of what's offered. Technical Remarks:You will need RealTime Player and a Java compatible browser to successfully navigate this site.  Some experiments were difficult to get up and running; however, for the majority, the pages changed quickly and the interactive projects ran smoothly.",5
2286,"I really liked this site..... enough to persue it with all the trouble I had accessing it... some sort of technical glitch. It was very informative and explained each ""trick""My eyes hurt afterwards though!Technical Remarks: Could not access this site right off the bat. I had to try lots of times over a period of 4 days. I finally got in, thank heavens because it was definitely worth it!!!!!!!!",5
2287,Excellent app for just about any subject. It creates a good collaborative space and can even inspire the non-participatory students just because they can use their mobile devices and interact with the lessons. ,5
2287,"VoiceThread was already easy to use as a web-based (cloud?) app, now it's optimized for use on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Making annotations via voice, video, or by drawing on the screen is simple and intuitive. The touch interface is a no-brainer for VoiceThread, and it integrates well with the other means of feedback.",5
2288,"Very good, realistic case study, but consisted of only a pdf file. Content is very helpful for the early nursing student.Technical Remarks:Much more technological capabilites could be incorporated. Narration would improve this immensely. Even if someone is just reading the case study like a book reader would read a story with emotion, etc. ",3
2289,Excellent (and short!) presentation on what Creative Commons is and how people can use it to share their creative works.  This will be particularly useful for faculty members looking both to share with and use the work of others.Technical Remarks:Excellent production; easy to access and view.,5
2290,Good material for a module on a circle. Thanks for posting. ,5
2291,This is a great site for dinosaurs!,4
2292,This was a fun and easy test to take. Test takers will enjoy the links and readings provided in the scored test. I did.Technical Remarks:Links all worked.  Extensive links to writings and journal articles.,5
2293,Needs radical 'bug' fixing.,2
2293,I loved this site and linked to it for my students but just discovered that the site seems to no longer exist (Feb. 2009). I have just contacted the AAR to find out what happened to it and ask them to bring it back!,4
2294,I found this article to be VERY interesting. The biological and evolutionary aspects that the hammerhead shark has gone through is remarkable and this article covered it very well. Kudos!,4
2294,"This is a great article to introduce to children, it deomonsrates the importance of selection and how specific gene mutations allow for greater survival amongst a large population.  One might wonder why all sharks did not have the same adapatation if they all live in the same enviornment.  But the hammerhead allows for it too hunt prey that other species of sharks are not successful at catching.  Thus a greater success rate.  ",4
2296,"I sepnt about 40 min. going through the materials. I specially liked ""Illusions"" the most.  It explained in clear detail how the illusions are achieved. For example, in Black Dot illusion, black dots appear as the eye scans across the image. The dots completely disappear when you turn your head at a 45 degree angle.  This site would be good for students interested in graphic/arts design, since many of them can be used in building a website.",5
2296,"hmmmm....this was my fault.  I didn't like this site very much because I thought it would be fun, hence ""recreational"".  I had just visited other sites that were playful, calendar games, puzzles, etc., so I thought this would be the same.  Rather, it's math.  Math that's over my head.  I stayed for awhile, and tried to ""get it"", but every time I clicked on a link I seemed to go deeper into ""this is not where I should be"" territory.  I must admit I'm not even sure I can pronounce (let alone understand) some of the words in the site.  Again, as Castanza says on Seinfeld, ""it's not you, it's totally me.""Technical Remarks: See above.  It was frustrating because I seemed to get deeper and deeper into stuff I didn't understand.  It was almost like a haunted house ride for me.  (nothing personal, of course).",4
2296,This site was very easy to navigate through because it was very self explanitory of how to go through the information. Recreational Mathematics is good for different age groups because it has different things for different age brackets. It is like abstract math and different things for different things. It was good for a student such as myself because it had us look at math at different point of view and angle.I learned alot about different types of math and different concepts to challange yourself. It was hard to pick and choose what to look at because there were so many hperlinks but once you made up your mind it was very easy to sift through what you were looking for or what interested you. It took me about hour to go through enough information to write remarks but overall it was very interesting.Technical Remarks: Need time and a plan to go through all the hperlinks but it is worth it once you figure out what you are looking for.,3
2296,"I found this site to be pretty interesting to me.I saw the recreation part and had to see what it was about. I think this site was the best one I looked at, it gave me so much info that I didn't even know existed in math, but now I do.Like the cryton... thing. I didn't even now what that was. this would be a fun and interesting site to use as an activity in class, to try and solve some of the problems, or at least discuss them to see what students have to say.Again this was easy for me to use, and I don't use the computer very often. I think I spent about an hour, hour and a half just looking and experimenting with things.",4
2296,"I browsed this website for about 45 minutes. I stopped and played with illusions, games, and sports. At these subcategories, they showed me how to relate math with each of these categories. I am a recreation major and work in the field and can see myself doing some projects with the kids that actually make them think mathematically when it comes to certain sports or games. I enjoyed playing with this site.Technical Remarks: The Merlot website is very easy to access and browse. I recommend using this subcategory - ""Recreational Mathematics,"" for individuals who teach math to all age levels. ",4
2296,"After 30 minutes into looking into this page, I clicked to find organized, alphabetical categories for recreational mathematics.  The material presents fun games and formulas that pertain to it.  These games will help learn formulas a lot faster and a lot more fun.  I believe first time computer users will find this site easy to use and understand.  A simple click of a button takes you to any game or any puzzle that is fun and understandable.",3
2296,"I spent quite a bit of time going through the different links.  My favorite was the ""I met a man on the way to St. Ives"" With seven wives, seven sacks, seven cats, each cat seven kittens, etc.  I tried it out myself but found my arithmatic not adding up.  It would be a fun activity for an advanced children's math course however.  I also enjoyed the information on the Rubik's Cube and the page regarding Baseball's mathematics. Represented were various daily puzzles and images that we don't normally put much thought into. I thought this page was very usefull.Technical Remarks: The layout was very simple to use.  It was hard to get lost, and very easy to find a way back to the starting point.  The use of the menues simplifyed the page well.",5
2296,"I learned a lot from this website. I spent an hour learning group theory. I learned about groups and group G for example is a finite and infinite binary set of elements. The operation of a binary is the four fundamental properites of closure,associativity,identity and the inverse property. If all four properties are satisfied then the system is a group. For example you can check this by using a negative number and a positive number -1 and 1. Under the operation of multiplication you can check the four properties.  You will find that all four work with -1 and 1.      The website shows diagrams and equations that are more complex, but you can still follow along. This helped me to have a better understanding of group theory.     This website is great if your willing to take the time to read the material. ",4
2297,Comprehensive app for wound care that contains a valuable information with a link to Wound Care Education Institute. Install was very easy.  Great resources for student nurses and practicing nurses.,5
2298,"I browsed this site, for about 10 minutes.  I saved it in my favorites list so I could come back to it.  I have never seen a website dedicated for accounting professionals for writing and it even had lessn for your voice and what words to use.  I can't wait to get back to this site to learn more.Technical Remarks: Ease of use, everything is oulined so clearly. Very easy to navigate.",5
2299,"There are quite a few applets that demonstrate this idea, and this one is much like the rest. Still, it works well and gets the point across.",4
2300,An effective applet with beautiful graphics.  The role the frequency plays in wave diffraction is made very apparent.,4
2301,Nice site with very useful links.,4
2302,"Like the rest of the sites in the author's collection, this site is very  informative, clear, and uses nice graphics (some animated) to illustrate the  points.   Very extensive discussion.  For a nontechnical discussion, this site  should be very helpful.",5
2303,Could be a great tool for creating virtual manipulatives to use in a math or science class.,5
2304,The best general purpose 2-d wave simulator I've seen.  Easy to use and incredibly flexible.,5
2305,"I'm a big fan of the podcast This American Life - they prioritize thorough research and engaging storytelling.  This case is a fascinating example of trying to create organizational change - the resistance, the successes, the failures.  Students would benefit a great deal from studying this case while learning theories of change.  However, there are a couple drawbacks - the audio recording is an hour, and the transcript version is an unconventional way to format a business case study.  The instructor would need to frame the use of the case in such a way that students take it seriously and understand how to use it.",4
2305,"This documentary, teamed with a study of John Kotter's Steps to Effective Change, can be eye-opening to many business students who are used to the idea that change is bad.  In today's economic environment, many working adults have suffered through change initiatives that failed due to poor communication and/or poor initiation of the change.  This video compares two GM plants who were told to change in two different manners and as a result had vastly different results. The differences are clearly delineated and apply themselves well to any discussion of organizational behavior, organizational communication, business strategy, or leadership.The video is easy to watch; the materials also include a transcript for those who prefer to read or who don't have time to access a video.  It should lend itself well to a discussion of how to communicate change and why.",4
2306,"This site is a large collection of applets with high quality graphics. Some of these applets have been listed separately on MERLOT. Graphics are consistently very nice in the applets that I looked at (I stayed in the ?Mathematical Ideas in Science? part). In some cases I am unsure about the content, in other cases the applets appear very useful. It?s worth to go through the site and try to find what you may need.Technical Remarks:Runs fine under WIN98 and Explorer.",4

2308,A great website containing articles about various international business issues in Asia.  Great for seeing how management is handled from an international perspective.  Discusses trends and business strategy.,5
2309,"This is one of the best sites I have ever visited, in terms of both content and presentation.  It contains useful information, is comprehensive, and uses a wide variety of presentation techniques, from games and quizzes to hyperlinked text.  The site is well above average in aesthetic appeal by its visual appearance.   There is also an invitation to enter your email address so you can be notified when new tutorials are added to the site.  (Since I chose not to submit my address, I skipped over this page and then had to return when I found this is the only place through which to reach the tutorials.  The site is very easy to navigate except for this minor blip, which probably reflects more about the user than about the site.)  ",5
2310,"Some of the ""tests"" were extremely long - like the recycling one.  While this material might be of interest, I 'm not sure I believe in its value for students.  Comparing themselves with Liberals, Conservatives and Independents is a curiosity, but personally, I would not take the reslts seriously.",3
2311,"This site is information about the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.The biographies of Alvin Ailey and Judith Jamison are good and are oneof the main reasons I direct my students to this site.  Many have never heard orseen this dance company so the site offers a thoughtful introduction.  The Company also does arts education outreach.Technical Remarks: There is a video clip in .avi format of the dance company available for viewing. My Mac converted it to QuickTime with no problem, but it did take over five minutes to download.",3
2312,"The website provided a good foundation of information about the topic.  The website is very text dependent.  Some visualization of the topic might catch the interest of the viewer more quickly. Overall, a nice foundational site for the beginner to explore podcasting.",3
2313,"This is a good reference material for conversion between ASCII and EBCDIC.  There is no tutorial available, it only contains an ASCII-EBCDIC chart with four columns (Dec, Hex, ASCII, and EBCDIC).",2
2313,"As a quick look-up for ASCII to EBCDIC conversion this is a useful, well-laid out, complete, and accurate table.As a learning object this page is not particularly useful because it does not provide a neophyte user with any explanations of the terminology and codes used. What, for example, would the term DLE Data Link Escape (CC) mean to someone unfamiliar with either ASCII or EBCDIC? Although the acromyms ASCII and EBCDIC are expanded upon, the links provided go to the parent sites (ansi.org and ibm.com, for example) rather than to pages that would explain anything about ASCII and EBCDIC encoding. My low rating reflects the fact that little, if anything, can be learned from this page. As a reference source for comparing ASCII and EBCDIC encoding it is very well done.Technical Remarks:The links for URL encoding and Quoted-Printable encoding near the top of the page are broken. The link labelled pdf for the ansi.org web site results in a page that says that the product requested is not available.",1
2313,This site is just a reference someone would use for ascll and ebcdic.             ,3
2313,"This chart show all of the required information.  However, it does not give any explanation to help with the information presented.",2
2313,"Works well as a quick reference for the two codes. Other than that, its a pretty self explanatory site and not very exciting.",3
2313,A plain site that just compares the two codes.  The links to other sites at the bottom of the page are in the same format.,3
2313,Gets to the point. No real information besides a chart comparing ASCII and EBCDIC codes side by side.,3
2313,"It is ordinary site, nothing exciting.  It has useful side-by-side charts of ASCII & EBCDIC.  That?s the only thing site contain.",3
2313,It is noting fancy.  It just provides the what all the characters are in EBCIDIC and ASCII.  It is nice though how they are right next to each other in the chart so that you can compare them.Technical Remarks: The first link what you enter the page does not work any more.,3
2313,"A no thrills chart that contains the conversions for decimal, Hex, ASCII, and EBCDIC values. This is a very practical site containing useful information.",4
2314,"Using animations is always very important for the effectiveness of digital learning materials. However, in this particular case, the quality of the animations is poor. The development of multimedia and interactive resources should be reviewed, in order to stimulate the meaningful learning. In addition to this, it is not clear the instructions for the navigation through the material. That is to say, it is necessary to show clearly how the students can use this learning tool and how to explore the animations. These instructions should not be only in the text, otherwise it is confusing to use the animations.",3
2314,This interactive site is excellent in everyfeature. I recommend to be used in the classroom to teach the students as agreat teaching tool.,5
2315,"Excellent collection of articles, tutorials and sample code on the subject of object oriented programming.  The site brings together a combination of commercial and non-commercial sites with background information as well as examples in many programming languages.  Sections of this site could easily substitute or supplement classroom lectures, practice exercises and assignments.  Students would benefit by using these links to supplement classroom lectures and textbooks.  The site organization is easy to follow.Technical Remarks: Several links are broken but using the back button takes you to the previous page.",4

2317,Unable to get into the site.,2
2318,"The information is good as a supplement to a course. The QuickBooks and the Excel videos are dated 2007 and 2008, respectively, and use an obsolete version of the software that may be confusing for some students. As a video resource, this is good and contains correct information. However, the presentation is a bit lackluster in someplaces and obviously dated in others.",3
2319,The site provides students with a visual representation on nine concepts in algebra and three in geometry. In addition the site show the steps on solving the problems.,5
2320,"Note from the author. ""This activity was written for a Microbiology course for health sciencestudents.  However, it could be used in a variety of courses, and does notrequire much background knowledge of biology or microbiology.  The maingoal is to illustrate the relationship between the use of antibiotics andthe proliferation of antibiotic-resistant strains of microbes, especiallywhen antibiotics are improperly used.  The activity can be used assupporting material for discussions on issues surrounding the use andmisuse of antibiotics, and the increasing problem of drug-resistantmicrobes.""",4
2321,"This is an excellent Tutorial about how to use Active Serve Pages (ASP).  It explains in detail from very basic components to how to write advanced ASP code.  For beginners, the step-by-step instructions on how to install Microsoft's Personal Web Server (PWS) or Internet Information Services (IIS) on different operating systems are very helpful.  I especially like the Examples/Quiz section.  Each example window has two panes which display ASP code and the output side by side.  This feature allows students to conveniently study the code on the left pane and see the result on the right pane.  This is really a nice feature and on-line learning tool.Technical Remarks:This tutorial is very well organized for on-line learning.  It has topics on the left of the window so users can easily choose a topic from the list.  It also has two navigation buttons (previous, next) at the bottom of each page so users can move from one page to another.  I don?t see any technical problems to use the material.",5
2322,"This site promotes discovery through multidisciplinary approaches. It has a wonderful history of calendars and how they have changed through time. It cleverly presents the mathematics behind the adoption of different calendars. There is also an excellent ""Do It Yourself"" section, which presents a study of the phases of the moon. This would be a great activity for students of all ages. There are many activities that could be created from the information on site for science and mathematics.Technical Remarks:The web site uses the an interactive program called Spicy Nodes. It allows you to go to different areas quickly.  It is extremely helpful since the material is vast.",5
2322,"This is an interesting site dealing with how callendars came into effect, how different cultures/countries use callendars and even day lights saving time. It also has sections on laws and why they came into effect, how they affect the community and the after effects on them. As for math though, it has actually very little math related material which, since it is under the math section, is highly disapointing.",4
2322,"I always take interest in materials such as these due to the fact that it is something we deal with everyday, all the while, not really knowing the level of complexity that goes into calculating it all out. All this time I have never looked into other calendars around the world and it was very intriguing to see how the use the moon or the earth, or both in their calculations.",5

2325,"This is a lesson that is relevant for all teachers. I am sure that most secondary teachers have their students complete research for their class. Many students do not know what a credible source is or how to make sure that there source is credible.  I like that you go through and explain what CARDDSS stands for and provide examples for each of the parts of the acronym. It will break down the meaning for the students and make it easier for them to relate to it and understand it better. I think it is good that you are teaching students what the different endings of a website mean (.org, .edu, etc). This will also help the students to better evaluate credible resources. It is a great idea to put the powerpoint on the class Moodle so the students can always access it and the struggling students can work on it at their own pace.  It is great that the students will not only be able to evaluate if the source is credible, but why it is credible or not credible. I think it is meaningful that you are extending the lesson into a powerpoint and something like a glogster so the students are able to work with credible and not credible sources. Overall, this is a great lesson that is applicable to teachers of many content areas. Technical Remarks:I really like how you indicated by highlighting where you were making adaptions to the lesson to make it more universally designed. It was nice to see in the comments on the side and it still gave it a neat, clean and organized look. ",5
2325,"This resource covers a real problem that I (and I imagine most other teachers) have encountered which is teaching students to evaluate web resources for credibility.  When looking at the lesson through the lense of the UDL principles this lesson seems to stand out as being great.  It's multiple layers provides multple means of representation particularly in the area of providing and activating background knowledge.  I felt that the opening discussion mentioned was a great way to accomplish this task.  The lesson also allowed students to take action and express their opinions through the discussion which is another UDL principle.  Finally, it seemed to provide a variety of levels and challenge and support through its use of CARRDSS and follow-up discussions.  This seems like a useful lesson for any teacher teaching research.  Technical Remarks:Everything seemed to work fine.  ",5
2326,"This site is incredibly comprehensive. the volume of examples are impressive by themselves, yet the details on each of these is also exciting. An index that is a little bit easier to navigate would be helpful, though it's hard with that much volume. very helpful for a beginnier trying to pin down exactly what characterstics make up a particular disorder, and I imagine also very helpful for a professional doing research or brushing up.",4
2327,"Excellent resource, I am a member of an A.H.I.M.T. and only wish we could get one of these written with all hazards in mind. This is a great tool to use during N.I.M.S. training and i have used it several times for students.",4
2328,"Really good - except that there are a lot of background concepts in GIT ( for example staging etc) that I find many undergrads to not really understand even after weeks of using it. For some, the phrase ""little knowledge is dangerous"" becomes really true and they wreak havoc on their repositories by using git commands without understanding what is really going on. 
So I am weary of tools/materials that seem to say - it is really simple - because it is not.

2329,Excellent source for those who are taking anatomy. Really great how the different bodily systems are separated to simplify studying.,4
2329,This website is great for teachers with no budget to actually be able to have disections in the classroom. This website would be so benifical to students!,5
2329,"Nicely broken up into anatomical systems and subdivided again for easy assignment and study.  A student should be able to focus on certain areas to a greater extent as necessary.  I found some of the numbers on the specimen pictures hard to locate, however.",4

2330,This app makes a collection of references on a selected topic. The range of reference types makes the learning fun and engaging. The app is free which my student teachers appreciate. They can gather current information on their topic of choice quickly and discern what might apply to their upcoming lessons. It is worth checking out.Technical Remarks:This app is designed for both iPhone and iPad.,4
2331,this is a good piece of education material . it gives people a reminder not to rely on the credit card when every time they go shopping.,4
2332,"Hi Jon,Wow an insightful and very engaging presentation. It was able to clarify maths concepts. the excercises where focussed and related to the content. The one aspect of the presentation is that I found it a bit to wordy. Technical Remarks:i like to fomat of your presentation and liked the manner in which you used slide transition. The music also made it a bit more engaging. You had the buttons at the correct places and it was easy to navigate. Although I have to admit there were times when I dod not know where I was.",4
2332,"This StAIR was very informative and visually attractive.  In particular, the music added a nice element to the presentation.  It would be very useful for students to use, but parents would also benefit from the tutorial especially as they help students with homework.  To improve the presentation you might consider,  allowing viewers more time to read through each slide or allow them total control so they can move to the next step when they're ready.  On the example slides adding audio describing the steps (particularly with the lattice slide and all the arrows) would also be helpful.",4
2332,"The presentation does not load from the MERLOT website.  I found the link on angel.  All bias aside, the presentation was ok.  I found myself unsure if I was supposed to click to go to the next slide or let the presentation automatically go to the next one.   The tables worked well for partial product method, however on the practice problem, I clicked one answer and they tried clicking another answer and it stated I was wrong.  (I am a math teacher)  The arrows on the lattice method also were a little confusing.  Possibly load each arrow one at a time so a student can see the process.  I also had problems with that practice problem as well and was not sure if i reached the end of the presentation or not.  With some tweaking and some different animations, I think this could be a really strong resourceTechnical Remarks:Timing versus clicking, some links in the practice weren't working correctly.  Adding some directions for the learner",3
2332,"The presentation of the material is very nice.  And, the music is a great element of the module.  The explanations and interactive portions were informative and easy to use.Some of the slides moved faster than could be read aloud.  I think it would be beneficial to the user if the user could control the pace of the slides in case a person needs to read the presented information more than once, or needs to read it slowly, or aloud. Other than that, the module seems very useful, informative and fun to use.Technical Remarks:All pages, arrows, and functions seemed to work the way they were intended.",4
2333,"I was first alerted to this site by one of my students who wrote a research project on N. Boulanger. The site includes a lot of original materials and the listed links attempt to be comprehensive.

2334,"This is a collection of ESL Student Resource websites for teachers of English as a second language, including material for listening, reading, speaking, writing, grammar, and vocabulary, with a separate section devoted to interactive quizzes and proficiency tests, as well as a large variety of reference materials.  A few of the links are not operational, but with the abundance of materials you should certainly find something worth using.  While an advanced student could probably navigate the site, I would not recommend it to the non-native speaking student because of its large amount of text used throughout.Technical Remarks:I opened the site up directly from my browser window (Safari) and all the links (except those that weren't working) opened up just fine.",4
2335,"Excellent presentation of the material.  The application does an excellent job of laying out the lesson objectives and learning process for the exercise.  The list of external resources provides additional information for interested students.  I also admire the active learning aspect of the tool, which asks for students to submit answers to questions posed from various web links.",5
2336,"I like the idea but with only one question per category, it would not really be that helpful for the students.Technical Remarks:Because of the format, I thought that I should move from slide to slide rather than playing the game.  More directions would have been helpful.",3
2337,"I've started to use this iOS app in my curriculum development work and my facilitation work. One challenge that I've found is that while it collects the contents of Post-it notes well, it ""misses"" any other notes. So, for example, if you have faculty members clustering Post-it notes and adding a label to them on a whiteboard, this level of analysis gets lost within the app. A work around would be to have clusters labelled with a different-coloured Post-it Note.
It does, however, offer a really quick way to capture & share work done with Post-its. To use the app fully, I will have to adapt my facilitation processes.",4
2338,I used this brief paper which addresses the need to protect crime scene in a introductory criminal investigation course. The students found the material useful but by adding practical exercises to this guide the students were able to connect the abstract to the actual methods of protecting a crime scene.,4
2339,"This is so well done. You do an outstanding job as a narrator. I was impressed with your ability to speak so coherently and flawlessly. You are very thorough in your presentation. A lot of information to take in. Your contact information in the end is a nice touch. I like how you presented information and then offered a quiz at the end. I would like to learn how to do this. I would have also liked instant quiz results too. Other than that, I don't think I would have done anything else any different. Overall, a great StAIR presentation. Technical Remarks:No technical difficulties.",5
2339,Tone of voice is clear as well as the pace is good.    The 'instructor' appears to be an expert in this area.  An excellent lesson for a new process that would save a lot of time in the registration process.,4
2339,"This was well done. It was presented clearly, which is hard when it is narrated! I gathered a lot of information and felt mostly confident when going into the quiz--I had to stop and think on a couple of the questions, largely because I haven't actually tried the software as most of the users/viewers will.Technical Remarks:Everything was done clearly. I like that I got to see my responses at the end after submitting. I did get stuck on a couple of the questions as I am not familiar with the software (more information would have been helpful in the presentation, but actual users might not need this as much), but my educated guesses still seemed to work.",4
2339,"Your explanation and voice were very clear and concise. I don't think I could recorde a screencast that long without saying ""um"" or ""like"" and you did an extremely good job at not using any filler words!  I'm not familiar with the program or the need for the various spreadsheets, but if I needed to gather the information or share it with other offices in the registration circle this would be a beneficial video. It was a little overwhelming for me, but that is probably because I have no background knowledge with this program. The quiz covered some basic questions from the video, but I'm not sure how I did on it. It would have been nice to have instant feedback to notify me if the answers were correct or incorrect. I would have also needed to see an example or written explanation of the task that I was going to need to perform since I am such a visual learner.Technical Remarks:The video worked just fine and the links during the quiz seemed to function as well.",5
2340,I found the video to be extremely funny.,5
2341,"I really enjoyed reading your lesson plan.  Your lesson plan includes a variety of pedagogical strategies such as engagement strategies, practice opportunities, feedback, setting goals, and scaffolding.I have not heard of the websites that you used to create the surveys and graphs. I cannot wait to implement the Kids’ Zone website into my math curriculum. It is very kid-friendly and would benefit my students in so many ways.It is important for teachers to make learning fun and keep the students engaged with strategies beyond a textbook. Allowing students to apply their learning to the world beyond the classroom teaches them more than just basics of the language.Technical Remarks:The links worked well!",5
2342,"This work is extensive and precise.  It would be very useful on different levels for different people doing workplace research.  For example I found Figure 1: Themes and characteristics related to work group effectiveness very useful for leadership students.  A concern I have, from a research perspective, is the age of the material.  Published in 2007, it is based on research not later than 2005.  That does not mean that the data is necessarily too old to be useful, but that currently it might not be applicable.  Because it is so specific to European countries, and their results varied, I would be hesitant to try to assign it in other cultures without additional study.  It does inspire researchers to try to replicate.",4
2343,"1. I have looked over your material for the past hour and feel it is great work.
2. I feel the quality of your work is great because you include so many options for the learner to pick from.
3. I feel this Web site will enhance the learning experience because students enjoy using the Internet and the information is clearly stated and organized. I feel teachers can benefit as well because of the convenience of it being on the web.
4. I believe 1st time users will not have a problem using your material because it is so organized and there are hyperlinks to each section of information.",4

2347,"This somewhat interactive PPT includes information about different library resources, and explains how to choose and evaluate them based on the information need. The information literacy definition is based on a British standard. Most of the content about locating resources is specific to the Everett library, and as the information is somewhat dated, cannot be easily generalized. The end quiz also largely pertains to that one library. The PPT is easy to navigate, and the images are appropriate. Sometimes the screen dumps are hard to read. This PPT would normally be used to orient students to library resources; however, its applicability is severely limited because of its specificity to Everett's resources.",2
2348,"The presentation is an excellent resource for any course that had a fraud component.  It provides definitions of terms (missappropriation of assets, financial statement fraud, and corruption) and provides real world examples.  Statistics regarding detection methods are detailed along with traits typical of fraud perpetrators.  Enables faculty to tie real world findings to the classroom.   Charts can be imported into a personally developed presentation with ease.",5
2349,As someone new to Google+ this presentation was helpful to me. It presented me with ideas on how to utilize Google+ both personally and professional.  This was a simple presentation that was easy to understand and easy to use.  ,4
2350,"How you reviewed the materials     I used the web site to perform several problems in preparation for an exam.  I spent around an hour working 20 or so problems that I already had the answers to.  The tables were very accurate and much faster then using my tables.Quality of content     The applet removes the redundancy associated with working thermodynamics problems.  By using the software, the student can focus on solving the problem and applying what was learned in class instead of wasting time flipping through tables looking up values.  The applet greatly reduced the amount of time needed to solve many of the problems.Potential effectiveness for enhanced teaching and learning     This applet is  another great tool in the arsenal of an engineer.  It should not be used solely by the students.  They should first learn how to navigate and use the steam tables.  This tool is great for upper level students that are trying to save time working problems as well as beginning students that already understand the use of steam tables.  Because most teachers dont allow students to use computers on their tests then the student may get in trouble using this applet as a crutch to much out side of class.Ease of using     The older applet was very confusing to use for me.  It however did have more features that were helpful.  It gave you the properties for the gas as well as the properties of the liquid.  The charts found on the instructions page were not able to be found in the applet.  The newer applet is not as helpful for me anyway,
 because most of the information I needed to look up was the entropy of gas or liquid contained in a mixture.  All in all, though, it was a valuable tool.Technical Remarks:The large java download before being able to use the applet may pose a problem.  Especially for students that are working on school computers.  In order to use the applet they would have to download the 25 MB packet each time they logged on to the computer.  The applet also gets some getting used to before it becomes really effective.  The applet is pretty user friendly when the user finally figures out how the check marks effect the newer applet or how to navigate through the tabs in the older applet.",5

2353,"I worked with this applet for about half an hour.  Although the applet appearance is rather plain, it works well, and cleverly presents a topic not easily described by text. The physics appears to be correct (e.g., momentum is conserved, energy is conserved when it should be), even in the limits. Calculations are done only to about 5 significant figures, so the velocity values can be off somewhat after many collisions. There are minor grammatical problems in the text, particularly in subject/verb agreement.  Overall this applet has a good potential to be effective in teaching the concepts of collisions in different reference frames. Its effectiveness for self-study could be substantially enhanced by including assignments or suggested items for students to look at.Technical Remarks:The velocity of the center-of-mass is not displayed in the lab frame, and the velocity of the right barrier is not displayed in any of the other frames while running under Netscape 4.75. Each is displayed under IE 5.5.",4

2364,"As a professional librarian I am concerned about this module. It promotes itself as a way to help students to effectively perform business research on the Internet. I find it completely lacking in that respect,in that it only provides a few recommended sites with no guidance or evaluation. As someone pointed out, the American Demographics site is going to be of little use without a membership. Yet a valuable site such as the Statistical Sources on the Internet site (u of mich) isn't even mentioned. Worse yet, why isn't there any mention of the university library and all of its far better business research databases. I could find more information related to this case in sources such as Company and Business Resource Center, ABI/Inform, or Business Source Elite than in all of the web sites mentioned in this module. I think it needs to be reconsidered as a Merlot resource.",1
2365,"This site was very easy to follow.  I actually used it myself to find my daily caloric intake and have bookmarked it for future use.  This site will be used in my classroom as interactive material. Another nice feature of this site is the online diet tracker - it is actually a link to a diet service that one can join for a minimal fee.  It seemed so good that I am actually going to join. The site has a massive list of popular foods as well as fast foods and nutritional value.   Technical Remarks: I liked the way the initial page was set up.  Instead of linking to each site from the 'popular features', there is a caption containing the contents of the link.  From there, you would actually link to a further site.  There is not an abundance of information on each page which is nice.  It is very condensed.  There is no guessing about what is a link and what is not.  All links are blue and other text is black.  Instead of adding a lot of text to the page, the site utilzes well thought out tabs and pull downs.  There is even a link for a nutrition glossary to help with vocabulary needs.  A user can also Google from the site.  ",5

2367,"1. How you reviewed the materials (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing, 2 hours trying it, or actually use it in teaching-learning activities?). I spent about 15-20 minutes reviewing this material. 2. The quality of content (Does the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) The quality of the content was good because the author presented how an abacus works in a simple and easy to understand way. It is educationally significant because the abacus was essentially the ?first calculator?. Although the abacus is no longer a practical tool now that we have electronic calculators, it is still interesting to know how an abacus works from a historical perspective. 3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning (If used appropriately, will students' learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?) If used appropriately students learning could certainly be enhanced. Although the lesson on how the abacus works was not particularly long, it was clear and easy to understand. Technical Remarks: 4. The ease of using the materials (Will first time users find it easy to use the software?)The website was fairly easy to use.  The information was well organized, and although sometimes the material was slightly confusing at times, I mostly understood the author?s explanations of how the abacus works. I also liked that he included a graphic where you could move the abacus beads up and down. ",4
2367,"I spent about an hour reading and playing with the abacus. After reading the tutorial, I continued to make many attempts at creating and solving a multitude of simple arithmetic problems. Now I know how to use an abacus!!!  The tutorial is written in a very simple and clear manner with step by step explanations. In learning any hands-on tool, simplicity in explanation is essential. This format is a very strong example of how arithmetics can be taught to those students whom are kinesthetic and visual learners. The abacus is an ancient yet very applicable tool for todays learning environments.Technical Remarks:      It would make the arithmetic explanations stronger if there were an abacus available right next to the explanation, in comparison to reading the explanation then scrolling back up to try it. I know it takes a lot of time to create that ability, but it would make the tutorial all the more stronger. Overall, it was great and very informative.",4
2367,"I approximately spent about 35 minutes on this site. It was fascinating for me because I have never actually interacted with an Abacus before. As an addition and subtraction tool, I can see the effectiveness and utility that could come out of an Abacus for a young student. Also, the Chinese characters that were includeded in the site were an incentive for me because, once again, I have never been subjected to them. This site could most definitely be an accessory and a teaching aid for an instructor. Technical Remarks: I had no technical difficulties with this site. In addition, it was a pleasure interacting with the virtual Abacus. ",4
2367,"Very simple and informative site regarding the Abacus.  I have never actually used an Abacus so I found the site to be interesting.  The general explanations and intructions on how to add/subtract using the Abacus were good.  I spent about 20 minutes reading the site and trying the Abacus.  As far as a teaching tool, if for some reason I needed to explain how to use the abacus or give a demonstration of what an Abacus is I would definitely reference this site because it is brief and concise.  I think that anyone could learn using this site.Technical Remarks: My computer did not have Java Virtual Machine installed so I had to download it and install it prior to viewing the online abacus.  ",4
2367,"I enjoyed reading about the abacus. I knew that the abacus was created as a counting mechanism centuries ago but never understood how it was used.  This report could use some more diagrams as Luis explains how to add and subtract, especially give examples of moving the beads from one rod to another.  The content is understandable.  I spent about 10 minutes reviewing the material.  Again, with more diagrams this could be a very effective teaching tool in showing children the history ""grassroots"" of mathematics and in teaching them how to count.Technical Remarks: I had no technical difficulties.",4
2368,"These quizzes are fun and  provide an opportunity to reflect on the outcome with learners. The website format makes me question the validity and appear to be a scam or lacking in credibility.

2. Convince the math department to make the necessary modifications in these problematic courses and continue to take the responsibility of teaching them.

Although the second solution looks more natural, in the Tel-Aviv University we were not successful in convincing the math department to adopt it, and we had to choose the first one.

The project ""Bridging the vector calculus gap"" is trying to influence the mathematicians to adopt the second (the better) solution. It could require a long and courageous effort, but it seems that by the use of pictorial and animated means among others, there is a good chance that the project will finally succeed. In such a case this will bring a great benefit to all sides concerned, and there are already partial indications of attitude's change in the right direction.",5

The multi-media presentations have been edited into bites requiring seconds to download, even with my archaic dial-up Internet connection. I give this site a five star rating in all three of the evaluation standards. It's content is inclusive, authentic, and endearing: *****. As a teaching tool, I will use it as reference, to elicit discussion, and (probably most important) to introduce my 80's born students to these jewels of truly American poetry: *****. There is a sigh of relief when the home page pops up. It is organized with a main set of links down the side; this is the only navigation needed and it anchors the pages together: *****.

2402,"How to Design using ProEngineer defines vocabulary terms such as axis and sketch, that are essential in the steps of designing. The tutorial provide options that guide information processing. Prompts for each steps are provided with an example of what the model robot, boat, and car should look like. The teacher understands how students vary in skill and abilitry level. Students have options of an easy robot, a medium level car, and hard boat, and an advanced level. Easy gives you step by step, medium gives minimum help, and hard gives no help.",4
2402,"There are NUMEROUS reasons why this tutorial creates an ideal learning experience for a wide range of learners.  To start, this author clearly highlights the intended goals for the learner at the very beginning of the tutorial. She uses a separate slide to highlight big ideas and relationships that the learners should be able to accomplish/understand as a result of completing this tutorial. This is definitely a great thing for ALL learners to be aware of at the START of any lesson. Next, one FABULOUS feature of this tutorial is that it is designed with varying levels of challenge and support; it’s up to the learner to choose their own preferred pacing of the tutorial. “EASY” for “step-by-step help”, “MEDIUM” for “minimum help”, and “HARD” for “no help.” This author has clearly made the decision to provide varied ways for a wide-spectrum audience to interact with the materials and achieve the desired outcomes. There is even an “ADVANCED” tab where the author has chosen to integrate assistive technologies by providing the more experienced learners with links to more challenging situations found on youtube.com.Moving on, if the learner chooses the “EASY” option, they are taken through a set of important vocabulary terms and concepts that are essential in understanding the basics of the CAD process. The words are broken down with visual information in diagrams- giving the learner options that illustrate the key concepts non-linguistically. If the learner starts at the “EASY” option, they are then on track to be guided through the “MEDIUM” and “HARD” options as well; because each of the three levels illustrate the creation of three different designs- a robot, a car, and a boat, the learner is being exposed to three design procedures, each of which gets increasingly more difficult, yet still scaffolds the learner for practice and performance.  In each of the three options the biggest thing that attracts me as a learner is the way that the author has chosen to break down the learning procedures so that the larger, long-term objectives can more easily be met- this certainly heightens the salience of the goals for the audience.At the end of the tutorial, the learner is expected to take an assessment that allows them to self-assess and reflect upon their newly acquired knowledge. The learner receives instant feedback with a detailed explanation for each “incorrect response” after providing an answer to each question- not only is this timely feedback imperative to the learner’s experience, but the explanations for WHY an answer is not correct (in comparison with just a simple “INCORRECT” slide) provide the learner with mastery-oriented feedback helping them to further reach their goals.The final slide leaves the learner with the option of experiencing more advanced tutorials, again allowing the learner the option of taking on a more complex understanding of the material.Very well done.",5

2416,You did a great job with adding redirect and review when the wrong answer was selected. I also appreciated the pen tool at the bottom of the presentation. It would be very handy for the viewer to make notes as they move through the StAIR. You might consider adding at the end of the PPT a way to contact you via email with an embedded link if there are questions that have not been answered yet. I understand this a “part 1” so this may be something for “part 2”. The other area that could potentially be helpful is to add a section where the camera user can access all of the forms to sign out equipment or permission forms for others to videotape can be accessed at. I think a “one stop” saves the viewer time is very helpful and appreciated. ,4

This site is not for ornithologists only: it is for everyone.  Just to mention one, the composer Olivier Messiaen in his work for the piano, The Catalogue d'oiseaux of 1959 is derived from bird-song and demonstrates the complexity and beauty of the subject.

2442,"This lesson on Google Calendar was very thorough. I liked the way that the presentation was embedded into a web page. The videos and the forward arrows allowed the user to work at his/own pace as well as giving time for review if needed. The inclusion of the Part 4 alternative review was very thoughtful. The struture of the lesson, especially the alternative reviews, take into account the various learning needs of students and naturally allows for student differentiation.This lesson would be approrpriate for students as well as adults wanting to learn how to use Google Calendar.Technical Remarks:Website, videos, links and forward buttons in web lesson worked without issue. The quiz that was part of the Google Presentation appears to not be linked correctly for the ""correct"" answer. All answer responses were given as ""incorrect"".

2454,An interesting concept and looks like an effective teaching tool if all of the parts would work as represented. The site would be more effective for religious study if many of the founders of religions were plugged into the system to show how they represent the Hero's Adventure. There seems to be a gap between the ideal of the site and the real of its use or uselessness.Technical Remarks:I could not get any of the story examples to open.,3
2454,"I have studied and taught this subject for years (in fact I have a PhD in folklore). So although I only spent 15 minutes perusing the site and have not actually used it for a class, I am familiar enough with the material and similar sites.This site allows students to get familiarized with the idea of heroic quest stories and to read both classic examples of such stories and those written by other students (a good idea). It's a well-designed site with nice graphics easy-to-use links. My problem with it is that it is all based on Joseph Campbell's ideas about the hero. And Campbell was not a very good scholar of folklore because he usually uses only PARTS of stories, completely extracted from their contexts, to prove his pre-existing theories. He also completely ignores other scholarship (in print) from his own time on the same subject. These are two definitions of bad scholarship. Also, his information and assumptions are sometimes inaccurate, or at the very least incomplete and slanted.Nonetheless, Campbell clearly appeals to many people and is often responsible for getting them excited about studying myth. So it is good to have familiarity with his work (just not to rely solely on it0. And as I said, I do like the idea of reading contemporary versions of the hero stories (written by students) that this web site includes. I often incorporate similar assignments and find them very effective, but haven't included students' stories on my website. That element of this site is nice.If I were to use this website for my hero's quest class, I would simply have to really emphasize what is good and BAD about Campbel and be sure my students also understand and are accountable for the many other ideas of the hero and myth generally. I have a website that does some of this: http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm (go to the heroic patterns link for instance).Technical Remarks: Technically the website seems well-designed and efficient.",3
2454,This site breaks down the steps taken by Campbell's  hero and clearly defines them.  Having examples to look through helps crystalize the theory for students.  Students would have a blast creating their own hero's journey stories!Technical Remarks:The only problem I encountered was in trying to read some of the stories in the archive.  The instructions on how to acess them were not terribly clear.,5

The site includes various features, such as sections on “teens and segregation” (comparing Mississippi, then and now, to the North), the meaning and significance of sex to racial dominance, the functions of lynching in the South, and more.  This site could also serve as a benchmark from which to launch class discussion about the extent to which race relations have changed over time and place.Technical Remarks:The site is well-organized and easy to navigate.",4

2462,"The lesson introduces young students to navigating the Internet by using humor and student guided practice. This lesson would be very easy to implement and provide students with a life-long skill of searching and using the internet to find information. I think that students would enjoy not only using the laptops but searching out information and pictures for their science projects. After teacher and student led instruction students will be working at their own pace, on individual projects with the teacher available for additional support should they need it.Technical Remarks:This lesson is suitable for young students just learning about the Internet. They will have no problem completing the activities outlined in this lesson.",4
2462,"Locating and discerning information is a daunting task for any learner, but to do this with younger students is an even more monumental task.  This lesson provides a great basis for where to go and how to go about it when teaching students about two kid-friendly search engines.  I can totally envision a teacher walking in with an armful of books, magazines, encyclopedias, etc. in order to captivate the attention of the students.  What a great example!  This opening visual and then demonstration using the laptop with an overhead projector would appeal to all students and be accessible to students whether gifted or with cognitive issues.  Also, having them work in pairs is a great way to ensure that they are working and understanding the material.  Guiding students with audio and a visual presentation works on so many levels and involves all students.  Also, limiting their time to explore to five minutes will keep them on task and focused.Technical Remarks:I would have liked links to the YouTube video and Yahookids and Askkids websites.",5

2465,"The amount of potential lecture material here for a medieval history course, or even a survey course that addresses the Crusades is enormous. However, as pointed out by other reviewers, there is no clear indicator of sources for most of the information; this could be problematic if the site were used by students for reference. Whether for instructor or student, the number of possible detours in the material is cumbersome and distracting, though the information contained therein is interesting.I don't know that this material is useful for students, though I would imagine many faculty could make use of the material if time allowed them to find specific information they were looking for. A more streamlined method of finding material within the context of the whole would be of great benefit, and would likely add to the number of instructors who might use it.",3
2465,"The creator of this site generously provides for free use of its contents. Persons who wish to use the contents for profit must contact the course creator. An introduction to this site explains that it contains myriad pages and that it would require several hours to fully read all material located therein. After a nearly hour review of the module's layout and content I found it quite useful for a prepatory discussions on medieval lifeways, pilgrimages, and the effects of the crusades. Full of insights and anecdotes, the material is potentially engaging, but navigation through the pages is somewhat cumbersome. No site map exists--one has to page by page make one's way around. The site contains primarily architectural imagery of important structures that ""our pilgrim"" might see as he travels from southern France to the Holy Land. However there exists little more visually here leaving me wondering more about the look and feel of the medieval world. The quality of the historical material itself is quite good and the bibliography underscores its reliance on worthy material. Text heavy, it could use both better quality imagery and bullet point summaries. Still, if an instructor is looking for a thorough discussion of the experiences of a pilgrim in the late medieval world, the sites one might see, key cities, troublesome occurances, and a window into the intricacies of the age, this site will satisfy as an introduction. Maintenance on this site is ongoing as is underscored by this comment by the site's creator,""I now will get busy filling in the empty spaces with at least some sort of description. After that will come a picture hunt, trying to find something to illustrate each stop. After that,
 I intend to add sounds: both samples of songs from the era and sound files pronouncing the many strange words. Finally will come the side trips (e.g., to Damascus). This all will take months to complete. You will be able to check here to see how it's coming along."" WSTechnical Remarks:For general use no additional pluggin or audio/visual software needed",3

2478,"I spent approximately one-half hour ""going through"" this article.  I spent time reading it, but did not download the necessary plug-ins to view the accompanying multimedia presentations.Quality of content:  The article is well written and addresses issues that should be emphasized, e.g., logical reasoning.  They present ideas for using discourse to promote students' thinking.  I would even like to see greater development of some of the ideas.  For example, ""How do I know I'm right?""  In terms of mathematical reasoning it would be good to have included several scenarios about counterexamples, the use of many examples not serving as proof that a fact/principle/algorithm is true, etc.  The Math Forum staff are continuing to provide materials that help mathematics educators improve the teaching of mathematics.Effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning:  Links between their findings and the research on student learning and  instruction are noted. Discussion focuses on the specific strategies that are used to help students become engaged in inquiry and take more responsibility and initiative in their learning.Technical Remarks: Difficult to use.

It provides the reader with pictures and videos of IT topics that a viewer cannot get in a textbook format.The material was easy to use.

The text of the presentations sometimes blended into the backgrounds making them a little difficult to read.Technical Remarks: The topics I reviewed seemed accurate and well-done.",4
2480,"After checking a few entries to determine the nature of the contents, I watched a few of the ""movies"".  The content is not laid out in a dictionary format, with a definition of a term and alternative definitions, but rather a series of pictures with texts describing associated terminology.  Thus the name ""Techtionary"" is a little misleading-- this is laid out more like an encyclopedia.Being familiar with most of the terminology presented, I found this site presented an entertaining, animated look at some of the technical concepts presented.  However, those not familiar with the terminology are at a disadvantage using this site-- while presenting itself as a ""Techtionary"" (implying definitions of terminology will be found here), many terms and especially acronyms are not defined at all.  This format has a lot of promise but in its current state it's either a work in progress or incomplete.Technical Remarks: Selecting items from the left term index was tricky because moving the mouse over other letters often put a new list there before an item could be picked.Some ""movies"" were too ""busy""-- too much visual content can distract from the needed information.A visible ""Cancel"" button would allow termination of a clip if the user found this was not what they were looking for.Overall, shows a great deal of expertise with the media was required, along with artistic proficiency.",4
2480,"Site was well layed out and easy to navigate. Approximate time spent viewing was 15 minutes. A wide selection of topics were available for selection.  Although the graphics were well done in quality, the quantity seemed to be overbearing. Animation was often provided where none was needed. Also, on some screens, graphic loading appeared slow, even over T1 connection.In general, I would like to see more depth on the topics, and a little less animation.Technical Remarks: Information provided appeared to be accurate. Some topics were covered in significant more depth than others. For example, NAT had little more than a brief definition compared to more thorough discussions such as ATM.",4
2480,"It is a good animated learning web site on telecommunications, data networking and internet technology. It's easy to read by using animations and textual descriptions. I took about 40 min to view the website. The waiting time for the animations was probably 5 min. So it should be better if there are no that many animations.

2480,"I thought there was a great deal of valuable information out there.  I spent around 10 minutes looking through some of the different terms.  I didn't have any problem loading the graphics, but uderstand how some might.  The only real complaint I had, is that some of the screens went too fast for me to read the info and take in the picture.Technical Remarks: Found many great terms out there, and even read up on some that pertain to the final project.  The graphics were nice, but became a bit overkill after awhile.",4
2480,"It seems that the website http://www.techtionary.com/index_in.html has more items than http://www.crosstouch.com/techtionary/index_in.html. Although maybe the website is the first and largest animated dictionary for some technologies in the world, although it indeed has a lot of valuable information, but I do not like it. Sorry, this is my personal opinion. I spend about one hour to explore the whole website. Sometimes I enjoy the animation rather than study the content. I think it should focus more on the studing material rather than animation. Technical Remarks: The dictionary is not important to a college student who is studing in a relevant major. Maybe it is more suitable to professionals. The loading is too slow. ",3
2480,Very good with terms and definitions in the networking field.,5

2497,I like the other commenters think that more explaination as to what each of the business entities are would be helpful.,3
2497,"The idea of the interactivity with the vocabulary terms is a great idea, but there was no consistency or organization as to the topics. Also if you got an answer wrong, it does not explain what is the correct answer.  Finally, there there were several spelling errors which makes the program unusable.",3
2497,"I believe this is an excellent tool to study and review the vocabulary terms.  The application incorporates auditory and visual stimulation, and presents the material in a unique fashion.  However, it does need revision in the areas of grammar and spelling.",4
2497,"This is a great idea for a self-study or review in class. However, there are too many grammatical errors for me to actually use. I would like to see a revision to correct the errors and I would use it in my intro classes.

This is good page for people to find a large amount of information regarding pascals triangle and the many ways it can be applied. Plenty of examples are provided and the steps are broken down making and clearly described.

This site makes an excellent supplement to typical mathematics text books due to the in-depth nature of the explanations. I have bookmarked it for future use.",5
2502,The details of this performance appraisal could either be very helpful or very overwhelming to both the appraiser and the employee.  If the manager has a large span of control he or she would spend much of their time completing the appraisal and providing this feedback to the employee.  This form would probably be best in smaller organizations with a horizontal hierarchy.Technical Remarks:This form could serve as a motivational tool for a highly engaged employee that has goals of upward mobility within the organization.,3
2503,This is a wonderfully easy to use App that can help educators at all levels add annotations to pictures.  I've used it effectively in helping individual students understand an assignment.,5
2504,"I jumped straight to the applet, as most students would after seeing the amount of text on the intro page. This is a neat little applet, but I wish it was a little more interactive and had a few more options for students to play with.

This site provides you with a very clear view of what exactly shapes like A deltoid and an astroid are and how the calculations draw them out on an X ,Y axis.  

This site would be very useful for a geometry class. Rather than looking at a static image on the board, pulling this up on the overhead will give students a more in depth look at how exactly these shapes are formed.

2508,"This lesson is designed to increase students’ awareness of Common Core Standard Writing (WRI) 4 (grades 9-12). I really like how the resource breaks down the standard from the beginning; thus, the content of this resource is easy to follow and the objectives of it are clear. I also like the checkpoints that the author provides after each section of the resource. This is another feature of the lesson that also helps students easily comprehend the information in the resource. However, I would like to see more visuals and/or videos presenting the content more interactively. Technical Remarks:Tutorial is in GoogleDrive.",4
2508,"I really liked the presentation.  What keeps it interesting is the visual layout.  For example, Not all slides are set up the same.  What was really nice is where you combine several quesions on a slide.  Visually it ties it together to show the student that these questions are related to one another (example-slide 28- task and purpose).  Technical Remarks:The slide show flows along very nicely.  Is this straight from Google Drive to the blog, or did you go to a host site, like Slideshare.net?  Just curious. ",5
2508,"This resource is intended for high school students to teach them  how to write with purpose and for an intended audience. She lists and gives examples of many different types of purpose for writing, such as, to inform, to entertain, to socialize or to explain.  The author breaks down each component; task, purpose, audience, development, organization and style.  I loved her use of real world examples that students can relate to and apply to their own writing.  The author includes checkpoints throughout the tutorial so students can check their understanding and follow along with the content.  The students are also asked questions to get them thinking such as ""Why are you writing? What are you writing? Who are you writing for"".  This tutorial was very well organized and informative. Technical Remarks:Tutorial is in GoogleDrive.  Many links are contained throughout the tutorial and returning to the slides can be done with ease.",4

In addition, the examples are thoroughly explained so students can understand how the examples can be applied to their own writing.Technical Remarks:Tutorial is in GoogleDrive.",4
2508,I LOVED the breakdown of the objective at the beginning. Many schools require the objective to be posted and in student-friendly language. It is good for the students to be able to see and understand the breakdown of what they are expected. There are mini-assessments throughout that allow the student to understand if they are on the right track. This is extremely text heavy. It is a big topic so it might be nice if there was a way for the students tobreak up some of the text by listening to an audio or video to go along with the content.  ,4
2508,"This StAIR is intended for high school use. It starts with a breakdown of the standard that the students are learning, which would be helpful for students in that they will learn the content better if they have a deeper understanding of what is expected. The presentation continues by explaning different aspects of the purpose an author can use for writing. After each section, the author includes a ""Checkpoint"" question, allowing for student interaction. While there is interaction and a few graphics, the tool is very text heavy and may be difficult for reluctant readers to stick with. Technical Remarks:Students must be using a computer that can run a Google Drive Presentation.",4

The concepts presented in the site are very useful and accurate.  The site is a good example of capturing the ""essence"" of operating systems. It is also easy to use. This source for operating systems can be a definite enhancement to learning and teaching.Technical Remarks: Understand that there is some prerequisite terminology that is needed for the potential effectiveness in learning can be realized from the site.

Otherwise, unremarkable.",4
2515,I spent 1/2 or so reviewing this information.  The quality of the material is presented in a clear and easy to read and understand format. It is easy for the first time users. This material could be used to enhance learning.Technical Remarks: I did not find any problems with this site.,4
2516,"I took ""a quick glance"" at this material and would say that there is a lot of material here that could be useful. The site is licened under creative commons which is usually a good indicator of its potential as a good resource and the gentle reminder to users to observe fair use policies. The videos and graphics on the main page presents a quick refresher of the discipline. I like the fact the videos are short and are also embedded in the page. I have found that redirection to a thirdparty website often proves distracting. There is a wealth of information available in this resourse. The potential for classroom application is evident through the suggestion of strategies in ""How do adults learn"" Persons using the site might wish to decide on an area of focus and use additional resource support from the references. I was not particularly taken with the layout and think the presentation could be more visually appealing.

2527,I am currently a  college student.  I viewed the website for about a half hour.  I used the site for two reasons: the first was the read out calculators and there affect in the class room and secondly to play the broken calculator game.

2530,"I spent about 20 minutes working with the applet and reading the accompanying textual material.  This is a learning item in progress, as several parts (applet tutorial, worksheet, quiz, SPICE simulation) are just stubs, and only one reference is given, and that is not on-line.  It could be effectively used as a lecture/demo, but probably not as a tutorial or homework without substantial instructor-supplied material.    The applet has the flexibility to show or hide various functions (density of states, Fermi distribution, density of occupied states), and because of this the instructor will need to spend a lot of time explaining what is being shown.  The default mode for the left display is too dense, but the applet gives the option of showing or hiding each of the various functions. The textual information currently in the introduction and mathematical analysis is not sufficiently clear for most students to understand the display on their own.   The change in the energy distribution of the carrier density with temperature is particularly informative, in part because of its simple display.  ",4

There is a useful selection of topics organized clearly -- Starting, Adding Text, Copying Clip Art, Creating Links, etc.  Information is presented simply and with effective illustrations of appropriate  dialog boxes, menus, buttons, etc. Actions are clearly described.  It might be helpful to also illustrate expected results so users can confirm their actions. Unfortunately this would counteract the simplicity of the tutorial.  However, it might be useful to do occasionally -- as when dealing with tables.  Technical Remarks: The selection of recommendations, e.g., ""no spaces in file names"",  ""text must be highlighted to apply settings"", ""save the graphic in the same location as your html page"",  is well-chosen.  It has been my experience that these and others included by the author are worthy of emphasis.

The applet is simple to operate, and generally straight-forward. There are some undocumented features: For example, the user can click and drag the slits closer together or further apart (however, the change is not reflected in the ""distance"" box). Also, clicking the right mouse button toggles the effect of the left mouse button.    The applet is visually effective, with the regions of maximum interference clearly visible. Unfortunately, these regions appear white, the opposite from the black representing matching phase points (e.g., peak values).    As is, the applet is a simple way to illustrate qualitative effects of constructive interference, although the explanation of a teacher needs to accompany its use.

Instead of continuing her ""voice"" and presenting herself as a professional educator, albieit a new one, she used colloquialisms and casual language typically used by the young people she refers to within her exposition. In terms of accuracy and thorough documentation, her work is excellent. And, she supports her thesis well.",3

At the time of this user's reading, this site had some spelling errors (Backgrounds section).Potential EffectivenessThe planned learning experiences could be valuable.  For example:  Task: Folding + 1 cut.  The animated graphics make the idea come alive, but the graphics go fast, without pausing, so the graphics don't necessarily help. There are some good ideas, such as trial version, among the suggestions for ""Making worksheets."" I didn't see any comment about creating a rubric that assesses students' understanding the concept.The other tasks look stimulating.  The ""Backgrounds"" section is really an essay.

2604,"I spent half an hour browsing through all the materials, thinking about how I would use them, and taking notes. Some pages I bookmarked.The one concern I have is that some of the links are stale. This is of particular importance in the case of the Collaborative Self-Study Latin course and the Continuing Education for Latin Teachers. I can see both of these topics arousing interest, only to disappoint users who discover that they refer to activities from 2001.Technical Remarks:The materials are designed for a variety of different audiences -- all Latin teachers, certainly, but of different courses and at different levels. There should be something there for everyone.Most of the material is easy to use, even by novice teachers. In fact, it's extremely helpful to new teachers to have such a collection of tested ideas described in detail (in most cases) in one place! If used appropriately, I think the materials would definitely enhance both teaching and learning.The concepts and models that are presented are frequently geared toward high school Latin classes and quite often offer ways to approach material on  the AP exam. Since I teach at a small liberal arts college, much of this material would not be particularly useful to me (which is not to say that it would not be useful to others, obviously). Even so, I would say that the concepts and models presented are educationally significant.These are the materials that I particularly liked and hope to use in my classes:Rhetoric ActivityMultiple Intelligence EvaluationsAeneid Book I Comprehension packetBacchus BallCrazy CardsDerivative SkitsForum Romanum webquestThese are the materials that I do plan to use in my courses and lectures this semester:Interleaving of Macaulay's Horatius poem with Livy's account (I will be lecturing on Catullus Monday night,
 and this is exactly what I wanted to do with some of the poems!)Mnemonics (every semester, my students tell me about some of these, and, since I never learned them, I haven't been able to use them to help my students. Now I can!Rhetoric Activity (every year, I teach medieval Latin literature in translation, and every year I struggle with getting the importance of the use of rhetorical figures across to them. I think this activity will help a lot!)I would be interested in using the Travelling with Students page and the Roman family tree chart, but neither of these resources mesh very well with the courses I am currently teaching.Overall, I found this to be a useful site with few areas of concern.",3

2606,"I spent about 30 minutes working with the applet and reading the accompanying textual material.  The applet gives a good qualitative sense of the Fermi level and temperature effects on the occupation of energy states. The supplementary material is very good.  The applet is simple to use and serves its purpose. It could be used as tutorial or as a lecture/demo.  The supplementary material provides a clear mathematical analysis of the occupation of energy states and a worksheet for students to check their understanding. In addition, the reference section gives links to many other sources that will be of interest to students seeking more information.Technical Remarks: I occasionally had problems bringing up a couple of the supplementary textual pages using Netscape 4.76, but no problems with IE 5.5.",4
2606,"This Physlet offers a clear and concise presentation of how electron distribution depends on the two different parameters of temperature and Fermi energy level. The user may interact with the physlet by varying temperature for a given Fermi energy level and vice versa. By doing so the user may witness how the two different parameters have different effects on the distribution of electrons. The presentation, however, is somewhat stark in that it lacks context. Specifically, it seems almost necessary in an introductory discussion of Fermi statistics to briefly talk about the Boltzman and Bose-Einstein distributions, how they describe the behavior of particles other than electrons and how they compare with the electron distribution. In short this tutorial provides a clear yet brief introduction to Fermi statistics and how it explains the behavior of electrons in a solid.Technical Remarks: It takes about an hour to hit every page of this physlet and do some of the calculations reqired in moving through the tutorial. A calculator at your side will help with the calculations. There is also a page designated for a quiz, however I could not find the quiz anywhere in the tutorial.",4

2607,I am sure all physics teacher knew about this site.  With teaching science to young children it is easier to get the point across with deomonstrations and live experiments instead of just talking about it.  To some students the distractions that occur during these experiments amy be too much for and the principles behind the experiments are lost.  But these all seem too apply a lot of background on the information of the experiment taking place. ,5

2612,"This was a fantastic lesson that I would definitely utilize if I were a high school biology teacher who taught about genetics. This would be really useful to students who missed class or who needed some review. The explanations are very clear and easy to follow.The standards and objectives are clearly stated at the beginning of the powerpoint, so that students know where they are going and what the end goals are. The lesson also caters to multiple learning styles, especially auditory and visual learners. The lesson accomodates students who have trouble reading/decoding text because each slide also has an audio recording that reads the information and questions on the slide. Ample modeling is provided--explanation is given first, then examples are shown, then students are given the opportunity to practice, and in the case of the wrong answer, students are provided with an explanation of why it was wrong and shown how to find the correct answer. Lots of motion and color are on the slides, making them visually appealing.Technical Remarks:The technology in the powerpoint progam was well used to create a slideshow that kids would really enjoy, and it's easy to use so students completing the assignment wouldn't run into technical difficultiesThe only suggestion I would make would be to provide a choice to play sound/reading rather than having it play automatically. For students who aren't auditory learners, it would probably be more preferable to read the information at their own pace.",5
2612,"This is a wonderful lesson! From a technological perspective this lesson utilizes PowerPoint that enhances the learning for students. It also provides an instructional video to cater toward learners who struggle with reading comprehension or fluency. This was also a great way to have an engaging anticipatory set in the lesson. Both of these technology enhancements provide students with added motivation for learning.From a pedagogical and content perspective, this lesson does a good job of walking students step- by- step though understanding the concepts taught. There is text, backed up by diagrams and visual representations to accommodate all learning types.  I also like how this lesson ties into a learner’s life. I think by providing meaningful experiences through the use of examples in this lesson provide more motivation for learning. This lesson has clearly stated objectives, goals, assessments and feedback. I like how students are given clear feedback upon how to correct incorrect responses. This helps students who need more scaffolding throughout instruction.  The lesson also caters towards visual learners because there are many visual representations used throughout the lesson to guide students to reaching their learning objectives. I am not a science person at all, and I could understand many parts of this lesson by looking at the pictures! Also, the use of colors really enhances the lesson and attracts learners to it. I also feel that this provides motivation for learning. Through the use of multiple assessments, the teacher is really able to know if the students are grasping the concepts and students are able to assess their understanding of the learning objectives. Additionally, there are clear instructions that guide students to completing this lesson independently.  Finally, there are many different tasks asked for students to do in this lesson that provides for higher level thinking and really gives the students a challenge by setting high expectations for learning. I would definitely use this presentation if I were teaching these concepts in my classroom. Technical Remarks:The only change I would make in this lesson is to split up the content into different parts. Especially for special education students or low achieving students, this may be too much information to throw at students in one sitting.",5

This lesson also includes a Voki character and voice on each slide, which would make this lesson accessible to a variety of learners and learning styles.Technical Remarks:I was unable to play the voice on the Voki character on the slides or hear the sound on the second to last slide. I am not sure if this is due to the fact that I am using an older version of PowerPoint.",4
2617,This is a really neat project!,5
2617,Very nice way to have students learn about music.  I like how you incorporated clips into your final slide before having students try to play the sequence.  Did you think of adding questions where you gave students an audio clip and asked them what type of note it was?  This may help with students who have difficulty seeing what is on the screen.  Giving the students the phrases or words to go with the note length is a nice touch to help with understanding.Technical Remarks:Audio clip didn't work for me - could you add where you got the clip from if it is available online?,5

I'm curious why ""simile"" is in a different color and thought there was going to be a focus on that figurative language tool during the lesson, but that wasn't the case. It's not a bad thing, I was just waiting for simile to take center stage. :)  Adding the hologram concert is a great way to connect to present time also. I was a little confused by the arrow on the top-left corner at first and had to click on it a few times to figure out what it's function was, but it didn't take away from the lesson at all. This is a fantastic lesson for teaching figurative language/poetry - expecially for students that don't typically want to learn about that topic.Technical Remarks:The link to the ""You are listening to..."" did not appear to be working. All of the other links and ""buttons"" worked just fine.",5
2638,"I created this Stand Alone Instructional Resource for my students to reinforce knowledge of poetic devices and support poetry appreciation. After purchasing a classroom set of ""The Rose That Grew From Concrete,"" I found my students to be highly engaged in the poet and his poems. This is intended to be independent practice for the student but could also be used in instruction to introduce/reteach simple poetic device terms or may be an introduction to the book.The presentation consists of navigational buttons where studens can read a short bio of legendary rapper Tupac Shakur, review poetic device terms, read his poetry, and even few some videos.Technical Remarks:This is a PowerPoint presentation in Kiosk mode. Once in viewing mode, press the escape button to exit.",5
2639,"Applet works well, but it is confusing because so many things are going on at once. Also, the graphics are a little primitive. For those having the patience to study it and understand what is happening this applet should be very helpful.",3
2640,"The Nolan lab has provided three tutorials, each containing multiple pages with illustrations and text. The tutorials are basic biology of Retrovirus Life Cycle and Evolution and Retrovirus Classification, and a more detailed overview of Retroviral Packaging Systems. The illustrations in the basic biology are those common to most virology chapters on retroviruses.  The Packaging tutorial discusses how retroviruses can be used as vectors to deliver foreign genes to cells, giving details of methodology. The site also provides protocols used by the Nolan lab and forms to request cell lines and plasmid vectors that are probably only of interest to research groups. ",3
2641,A fantastic tool. I find it can be used over and over again while teaching waves to provide a quick visualization of exactly what a property mans.Technical Remarks:Fairly processor heavy.  Certainly you will to download and attempt to run on your in class machine before getting the kids hopes up in class.,5
2642,"30 minutes is about all the time you need to get a good idea about what RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT FOR PROJECTS is about. It is relatively easy to read, useful and will enhance a student's learning.Technical Remarks: It is interesting to see this type of information from a European point of view. The site references several interesting examples. It is a commercial for the RAMP Handbook and ordering by phone may be confusing for those of use who live stateside. Other than that, useful information!",4
2642,"I spent an hour reading through the site.It is quite informative on the subject of risk, and risk management.  The examples are excellent.The instruction on the method is reasonable.  It is an advertisment for their book, the explanation on the method is rudimantary thoguh sufficient for a basic understanding.  If you want more details, you'll need to buy the book.  As a primer of risk managment, it is excellent. Beyond that, you need the book.",4
2642,"Some of the important issues concerning Risk Management are presented, however when you want to go in depth some of the links send you to the advertising of the book. The content is short and general; I liked the way they have structured the risks in a company/projects.",3
2642,Used this document when reviewing the SRMP designed for our Software Engineering class. Helped me sort through alot of the jargon in the document.,5
2642,After spending about 15-20 mins you have a good understanding of the different aspects of risks associated with different projects.,4
2642,I spent about 15 minutes browsing this site. Definitely a useful resource to have when starting a project.,5
2642,I spend about an hour reading the material. It was an advertisement for their book. It did give some of the basics about Risk Analysis and Management. ,3
2642,I reviewed the material by reading the Methods and Analysis page and then simply browsing the rest of the site.  Yes the content presents concepts that are educationally significant.  Students' learning will be enhanced the way this site breaks down the concept of RAMP into simple everyday decisions.  ,5
2642,I spent 30 minutes reading through the site.  This is very informative site on assessing risks and their affect on a project to be undertaken.  I was suprised at how well the information was presented with the subject being so complex and important.  This is definitely a technique to look at when the next project comes up.  Very well done.Technical Remarks: Website navigation was well designed to make it easy to follow.  Always room for improvment.,5
2642,I spent about 45 minutes reviewing the various pages on the website.  I used it to verify that the Risk Management Plan for our project is on target.  The website was very informative and clarified some fuzzy issues.  It went step by step from beginning to end on how to develop a risk plan.  The website was very easy to use and follow.  It would be a good supplement for the classroom.,4
2642,This site is devoted to reducing or eliminating negative outcomes in projects.  It provides an overview of risk management from why it is needed to how it exists during the life of a project or assest.  This collection would be useful for background material or supplement in a discussion on risk management in projects of any kind.  Links are easy to navigate.,4
2643,"There are so many different versions of this game and they depict the fundamentals of newtonian physics. They are fun, informative, and beneficial to teachers and students!",4
2643,Really cool website. Includes an interactive simulation where the factors of the rocket can be changed to viusually see the impact on the rocket's performance. The website as a whole is pretty good too. Website includes other visual information about rockets. Useful for students learning about how rockets work.,4
2644,The information is a great intro to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). OSA is a critical public health issue. There is not much posted in Merlot. Sleep Health is a new initiative in Healthy People 2020.Technical Remarks:Easy,5
2645,Useful beyond regular textbook,4
2646,"This applet is the same one that we looked at in class, but I think is very useful. The relationship between the motion of an object attached to the spring and circular motion is demonstrated. It is still funny how the applet moves so fast. The relationship of the force and velocity vectors is shown on the applet. The most interesting aspect of this applet is that one circular orbit is equal to one oscillation.",3
2646,Nicely done demonstration that displays clearly the concepts involved in simple harmonic motion. Similar demos are common. Aimed at introductory physics students.Technical Remarks:Easy to use applets. Worked fine.,3
2647,"the flow of the material is linear and difficult for the student/user to navigate around; as a material for tutorial, it lacks substance and features that reinforce learning  Technical Remarks:there's a need to improve the graphics, layout, and even the entire package; the material glares with all the red font and lines ",2
2647,"This item has been triaged by the Teacher Education Editorial Board.  Although it will not be reviewed, we invite you to add a comment if you have used this item.  It offers several, brief but useful suggestions to anyone having problems getting started or understanding how to study effectively.",3

2649,Very useful to the practicing surgeon,4
2650,"This is a well-respected, always current reference site for accounting sources on the internet",5
2651,"Volumes of information here, as I wanted to direct my K-12 inservice students here but at first look they were cognitively overwhelmed. If the information was less ""clicks"" away, navigation could be improved. Also, some links not operable.Technical Remarks:Changing to a matrix display of sorts could help. The tools and examples are valuable, but with the goal of reaching out to teachers to integrate technology, it almost reinforces the difficulties and challenges they are fearful of. ",3
2652,"I do not teach language arts, but I do teach keyboarding and business classes where the semi colon is used.  This lesson is geared towards Middle School, so it is a little more colorful than I would prefer for High School age students.  It would have been nice to indicate that there is not any space before the semi colon, but there is one space after the semi colon.  This is something we teach at High School level.  Another thing I noted was that the colon in many of the headings were not the same font as the heading.  Students would get marked down for this in a business class.  It would also be preferred to move to the next line if your reducing the font in the heading.  Overall, it was a good lesson, but these few things were noted for a High School level class.Technical Remarks:Overall, the technical aspect of this lesson works.  Here are some petty changes that should be made to make the presentation perfect: Some of the icons used to click on to navigate contained text that was not hyperlinked.  The icon itself was hyperlinked, so clicking towards the outside edge of the icon will work.  This may cause confusion for some students trying to click on the text within the icon to move ahead.   At the end of Quiz 1, the icon to take the quiz again indicates the user will go to Quiz 2 instead of Quiz 1.  This may cause some confusion for the user. I personally did not care for the end of the lesson how the user is prompted to review again instead of giving them the option of going right to the final quiz.",4
2652,"This lesson was a good instruction on how to use Semicolons in writing.  Seeing that I am a viewer coming into this StAIR with little knowledge of how to use of semicolons properly, I found the resource valuable.   The lessons on how to use them were successful for this viewer, but I did find the “pattern” slides for the use of semicolons a little confusing.  It uses UDL principles and engages the viewer with slides that are interesting to look at.  Some of the slides are heavy with words, and could possibly be broken up with an image.  I really liked the assessment at the end of the resource and think it is a great way to evaluate how well the kids did.  I would also have liked a back button in case I wanted to go back and review, as I didn’t know I was about to leave the Power Point to take the final quiz.Technical Remarks:Would only like to see a back button on some of the slides in case I wanted to go back and review.",4
2652,"Great presentation for Middle School students to learn about semicolons.  The information is well represented, with key ideas defined and illustrated. I found the individual response slides to each quiz answer helpful in reaffirming and summarizing the content.  Both Rule sections provided a scaffolding of helpful content information, culminating in the Quizzes.  The use of bright colors should help keep the student's attention and engagement, although at times I was overwhelmed by the amount of different colors (would have preferred the navigation links used the same icon and color themes throughout).  Chunking of content for each rule made it easy to follow, and wrapping it up with a Google assessment is an excellent way to capture student's progress, and source to provide later feedback to the students.  Nice job!Technical Remarks:1) Portion of description in lower left-hand area on slide #4 is missing.2) Navigation worked as noted, except for slide #24 which indicates ""Rule 1 Recap"" when actually returns user to the beginning of Rule 2 (the description is incorrect).3)  I would have preferred a note on the last slide to let me know that I was being taken outside the presentation; that it was the last slide and that I would need to return to close the presentation after completing the Google assessment (although am sure students would figure this out).4)  Would have been helpful to have a ""Back"" navigation button on slides after a ""Rule 1"" or ""Rule 2"" selection was made, in case the wrong option was selected.  Would save time over having the user click to the end of each rule paths.",4
2653,"The materials you have listed to complete this lesson are an Interactive whiteboard, Internet access and media player with example recordings. Recordings will be useful in helping your students hear a dotted rhythm, but how will you incorporate the use of the internet and the smart board? This resource will be better rounded once these materials are addressed. The techniques you have listed are worthwhile to keep, but might be challenging to accomplish with a larger group of students.",3
2653,"If a dotted quarter note is something that is heard is music by 5th adn 6th grades, might it be appropriate for them to hear it in their own popular music? Offering students the opportunity to find these types of notes in their own choice of music might be a way to engage them into the lesson as well. Technical Remarks:Nice Job.",4
2654,"This site compiled five instruments for assessing teachers’ use of technology in many areas of educational technology including technology integration, attitude towards computer and information technology, technology adoption, and technology competencies. The instruments are available in web-based, PDF file, and Word document formats. While these instruments seem to have been reviewed for inclusion, no critique is given, just a brief descriptive note. The overall site links to many resources browsable and searchable by grade.",3
2655,"Terrain is an online, open access journal addressing sustainability at an interesting intersection of science, art, and philosophy. The journal consists of articles that include personal expressions, editorials, and scholarly papers. The journal has seven main sections: Columns, Poetry, Nonfiction, Fiction, Interviews, Reads/Reviews, Arterrain, Unsprawl.
 
Immediately I found material that I plan to use (columns, interviews, and articles from the UNSPRAWL section) as reading related to current event or discussion board assignments in our college’s Environmental Conservation course.
 
I went to this journal seeking these instructional materials. However, the design of the web site has a visual appeal and ease of navigation that drew me to explore further and the power of the content I found spurred me on. I read columns and interviews that inspired me to think deeper about integrating sustainability into my daily life at home and as a community college instructor. I will certainly return to these sections in the future and to the poetry and fiction sections for leisure reading.
 
The levels of interest that this journal sparked in me make its use as an educational tool even more appealing. I look forward to exposing my students and colleagues to the materials in this journal.",4
2656,I am planning on adding this material to a packet of support materials which will be used by a small cohort of faculty as they develop collaborative learnng projects.  Will comment again after I get feedback from faculty.,4
2656,"After reviewing the content of the website, I employed this strategy within my own college methods course.  The students enjoyed the collaborative method, indicating that it was a strategy to place in their ""toolboxes.""  The website provides specific information implementing the strategy in the classroom and could be of value to any teacher-leader.",4
2657,"I used the Aesthetic Realism Teaching Method in New York City HS classrooms for more than 30 years.  It brings the very best out of young people's minds--enables them to learn successfully, pass standardized tests and become kinder, more just human beings.  This method gracefully joins, in every lesson, the subject and ethics in a way every teacher would find beneficial.",5

2659,This really show how chemistry and physics is used in cooking meat or anything that requires cooking,5
2659,Great website that explains the thermodynamics of cooking. Its great how thermodynamics can be incorporated to everyday matters. I think the description of the five processes for heating food was.... most interesting.,4
2659,This is an experiment that all children can follow and teaches them simple reactions that occur while cooking. It translates what they are learning to something they observe everyday and can understand.  It  will also intrigue them to qusstion why and how certain things occur in nature. ,4
2660,Very useful for students,5
2661,"Basically, this is a very simple site.  I spent approximately 30 minutes clicking on different dates that were related to family member's birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  It was interesting to see what happened if anything in the history of psychology on your birthday.  A lot of information is provided.  If you were looking for something specific and had a general idea of when it happended, you could easily find it.Technical Remarks: Very user-friendly.  I had no problems using the site.  Rather self-explanatory.",4
2661,very good site. I found it very informativeTechnical Remarks: Very easy to navigate.,5
2661,I spent about 15 minutes clicking on different dates in this site.  This was a very simple site to use.  It is an easy and quick way to get history facts in psychology.  ,2
2661,"Interesting web page.  Very simple to use.  You plug in a date and it tells you what, of importance in the history of Psychology, went on that day.Technical Remarks: Easy to understand and use.",5
2662,"Educational value: Way above any standard textbook - Actual patient's MRI rendered in the form of a video, with labels and narration",5
2663,"This thorough fill-in-the-plan tutorial template can be incorporated into a webpage. As such, it also provides instructional designers with the elements that they should consider when creating a tutorial. Even if the person does not have the technical skill to embed the tutorial, the documentation is useful.",3

2665,"a. I found out topics and how the topics/concepts/practices are introduced.  
b. The material accurately presents the concepts since it is a good refreshener to pull back my memories about the Algebra learned before.  
c. If used appropriately, learning will be enhanced since it covers all the Algebra basics.  
d. It is not hard to use since once you get familiar with the format of topics and sub-topics, it becomes a handy reference material.Technical Remarks:The topics, examples and graphs/figures match effectively.",4
2665,"This is a great and easy to use site for people who are either just starting algebra or those who need a refresher course.  This site has topics that range from basic arithmetic to quadratic equations.Technical Remarks:The website is well organized like a math text book, so every topic is split into different topics.  Also included are graphs and samples, and its very easy to read.",4

2669,"Nice, short summary of 1) Need for maintaining contact with students, especially distance students, and 2) Some tools available for offering ""virtual office hourse.""   The technical information is a little outdated, but still a useful introduction.",3
2670,"Currently there are over 300 syllabi in this collection.  Not every discipline is available, but if yours is, this would be a great way to see what others are doing in their classes.",4
2671,This is a very useful site for faculty teaching voice disorders at the graduate level. The site is easily navigable and consists of copious multimedia material which demonstrates normal and abnormal anatomy and physiology along with technical aspects of videostroboscopy. Although the author is an Otolaryngologist the site is specific to laryngology and as such relates very well to speech-language pathologists.Technical Remarks:Vidoes are linked to youtube so most multimedia will play easily regardless of browser.,5
2671,Good way to introduce pictures and video and voice samples into the classroom via laryngoscopy.  Negatives are that there is not a mention of Speech Pathologists role in voice treatment nor is ASHA mentioned in the links. A student would be able to go through the web site and view anatomy of the vocal cords and surrounding area during a diagnositic test and problem solve and/or discuss with others in a group. Technical Remarks:not easy to navigate,3
2672,"This website provides valuable resources for pre-professional and practicing educators.  Students in my English/language arts methods were able to use this site as a means to ""break ground"" on initial topics concerning language arts and ideas for unit and lesson planning.  This website does inspire or motivate creativity for educators to integrate reading, writing, listening, and viewing in the elementary, middle, and secondary English classroom.Technical Remarks: For the individual with a specific topic in mind, the website provides smooth initial navigation through a wealth of resources possible.  Most tend to be website, but other downloads are available through further link navigation.  To invest some time sifting through the data is an advantage, allowing for a rich evaluation of content and store or ""favorite"" sites which are seemingly applicable in the moment.  Most links are accessible.",4
2673,Thanks for making this site available for teachers and students. ,5
2674,The photographs and information provided in this site is easily located and navigated.  Information is provided in terms students will understand.  Interactive features are a bonus!,4
2674,This explanation of planets is well-detailed without using a lot of technical jargon which makes it more accessible to students.  I think that I would easily be able to simplify the information even further to teach to the lower grades in elementary education.,5
2675,The authors made a good start and this video could certainly be helpful added to a patient educational program.  It could be better by fully discussing the importance triggers play in control of asthma.,3
2676,A fine presentation of the concept of pseudo science with a rich listing of sites that illustrate various aspects of the presentation.  There are many examples of what is being presented.Technical Remarks:The visual appearance of the basic page could be improved.  The size and types of fonts and the use of color needs to be rethought.,4
2676,"I found this to be a thorough examination of pseudoscience. Also, the materials include not only information but also thought-provoking images and humorous cartoons. In addition, there are many resources embedded in the page that professors might find useful for their own purposes.",4
2677,"This is a very well presented tutorial on what makes an article peer reviewed. The section on using Ulrich's to determine peer review is helpful.It would also have been nice if they would have included some of the visual cues that students can use to determine peer reviewed materials (e.g., advertising, etc.).

This tutorial would be very easy to incorporate into a class or into a larger online tutorial  on evaluating resources.",4

2682,"I played around with this for about 10 minutes.  It is a very easy to use Java applet that simultaneously displays position, velocity, and acceleration graphs, with the capability of varying the values of the acceleration (taken as constant), and initial position and velocity.  It has substantial potential for helping students understand kinematics graphs, but requires some instructor-supplied textual assignments to go with it.Technical Remarks: It works well with both IE 5.5 and Netscape 4.7.",4
2683,"Many of the pages are useful resources in physics instruction.  Others are not-so useful.  The online quiz on circular motion, however, is quite good and could be used as an assignment by teachers.  The author needs to differentiate between ""centripetal"" and ""net centripetal,"" however.",3

2685,"I spent about 20 minutes reading this article.  I really enjoyed learining more about the n-tier approach to application architecture.  The article is a detailed explaination of an approach to developing architecture that has two or more isolated layers.  The typical model that is shown in the article separates the architecture into the Presentation GUI, Presentation Logic , Business, Data Access and Data.  The benefits of this separation are explained in the article.  I was particularly interested in learning more about this approach because I have seen it in the workplace, but did not completly understand it until now.",5
2686,"With brief browsing, I did not find educational resources (like simple handouts) that were easily accessible for patients or clients who were grieving. I suppose if they bought your book, that would be their resource. It was interesting to have an active chat for support of each other. Nicely done.",3
2686,I spent about a half an hour reviewing this material and found it very helpful.  The quality of content was very good.  It is a very good website for someone going through grief to read other stories and how they handled it.  I believe it is a good learning tool to help understand what people go through when they grieve.,4
2686,This site is very informative and I would highly suggest it to someone who as lost someone they were close to as a support group.  I was in this site for about an hour reading the stories from some of the people who lost loved ones.  It puts things into perspective.,4

I believe the quality of the content is througrough, and easy to read.  I believe someone could learn from this site, and is beneficial.  Technical Remarks: This site was easy to obtain the information, and was clear and focused on the main points, as well as the major contributions.  ",5
2686,"I spent nearly an hour reviewing this site. The site portray's peoples grief, in their own words, and allows others to share, or respond. It is very enlightening, to read how people deal with their grief, and what they wish to express. If someone was researching, dealing with death, this would be a good site for them.Technical Remarks: The site is well divided into sections allowing the user to pick what they are interested in. After choosing, the link's information flows easily. ",5
2687,this is a good site for refreshing what we hve learned so far.,3
2688,This is a nice series of short videos on using social media tools. It would be particularly using for K12 pre-service teachers.,5
2689,"I liked the cross curricular offerings in your STAIR...Your inclusion of Graphing concepts to show the changes in Supply and Demand were a way to incorporate UDL principles visually depicting concepts presented logically earlier.    I think the scaffolding concept works well with your STAIR because the higher level students could review these slides and take the quizzes and walk away empowered about some key economic concepts of changes in quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The vocabulary in your slides was also appropriate to the age group, and the vocabulary challenges them...example, A plague decimates the cattle population.  A blight on coffee plants....so I think at many levels you are challenging students.  You also employ UDL concepts to make the information relevant by examples of the iphone 5, etc.   I know economics, supply and demand concepts, and the monetary implications.  I saw you used a number of Icons, $ in gold, dollar bills as backdrops, which at times seemed all I could concentrate on vs. the quizzes, so  is there a way to include the symbols but tone them down?  Technical Remarks:  20 minutes",4
2689,"I love the diagrams used in your STaIR. It allows the teacher to see if the students truely understand the concepts. I was a bit nervous when I received a quiz question after the first slide, yet, I feel it made me focus more on the material. I've only have experience teaching middle school Social Studies for two years, therefore, I am no expert. Yet, majority of the slides seemed a little wordy. Although, speaking from experience, the tests are also wordy. I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to use visual representations in your multiple choice options (i.e. up & down arrows to represent increase and decrease). I really loved that a couple of the slides encouraged students to compared/contrast the diagrams to create a true statement about the diagrams.Technical Remarks:This would be a great activity to incorporate active responses (clickers).",4
2689,"This resource can be a great way to review Demand/Supply. I really like the questions and the quiz style that you used. However, I would suggest some improvements. Firstly, I'd suggest the addition of images to the presentation, as it provides better comprehesion for visual learners such as myself. Your graphs are great, but could work better if dialogue boxes were connected to them to better demonstrate how and why the arrows move up or down. I also find that the amount of text per slide should be downsized.Technical Remarks:Links work correctly, but I feel like a ""back"" button, as well as a ""home"" button, is missing. It would be helpful in case the student wanted to review the info before answering the questions provided. ",3

A design pattern is a successful solution to a set of forces and problems that arise when building software. Patterns aid the development of reusable software by expressing the structure and collaboration of components to developers at a level higher than (1) source code or (2) object-oriented design models that focus on individual objects and classes. Therefore, patterns facilitate reuse of software architecture, even when other forms of reuse are infeasible (e.g., due to fundamental differences in operating system mechanisms or programming language features).3.

2696,"The lesson looks at the need to make computer science and engineering more exciting to students. Technology is growing and changing everyday which and students need to be able to keep up. Four instructional objectives are reached during the lesson. They include performing skills, recalling facts, indentifyng concepts and applying pricniciples. The lesson strengthens the students ablility to collaborate within groups, promote creativity and independent thinking. The intended audience is elementary through high school who will be able to communicate through a safe social place by the name of Edmodo. In this lesson, students will need access to a school computer or home computer, CAD software, and access to email, google docs, and the internet.",4
2697,We used the interactive case for disaster (trauma pt).  Visually engaging.  Very interesting.,5
2698,I spent an hour or so browsing the site and reading many of the WebQuests that were provided as links.  Most of the WebQuests that I viewed could easily and very effectively be used in the classroom with little or no adjustments being made.  This is great resource for increasing Internet use in the classroom in an effective way.Technical Remarks: The web page is easy to navigate and most of the links are active.,4
2699,"I like the idea of using a virtual titration to help prepare students for a real titration that they will be doing the next day.  I know how challenging this can be for students the first time and I know, even in advanced classes, that they usually screw it up.  I think doing it virtually first is a good step to preventing that.  In addition, I like how you say this is the first lab where the students will be graded on accuracy because I think that will make the students pay closer attention to the virtual titration in hopes of being more successful the next day.  I think the amount of technology you need to do this lesson is very doable and is not outside of the scope of a chemistry class.  As a question though, where did you get the virtual titration simulation?  Is it a web based application that is out there for free or is it software that had to be purchased from a vendor?As a suggestion for making this lesson plan better, I believe including some form of state content standards might be a good idea.  I know that where I teach every lesson I do has to be directly aligned to some content standard or another and I have to be able to demonstrate that alignment if needed.  Perhaps simply finding one and throwing it in there would be a good idea.  The only other thing I would perhaps suggest is that you physically have the students practice the act of titrating before grading them on it.  I know the virtual titration is designed to help that but at the same time I know how difficult the physical act of doing it is.  No amount of virtual training can make up for that.  I really like the idea though and would be interested in using the virtual simulation myself.Technical Remarks:Technically, everything worked fine in the document itself.  I also believe the virtual simulation would work fine in a high school class.  My only question is where the virtual simulation software is coming from, either web based or purchased software?  Otherwise, no problems at all.",4
2699,"I think this lesson is fantastic because the more a student titrates the better they get.  Using an online simulation is an excellent way of having students practice the physical skills and procedures, along with working through titration calculations, which are some of the hardest in all of chemistry.  The hands-on components of the lesson will engage students and will also provide you time to see how students work together on these problems. Having the students complete an actual live titration will solidify and confirm what they learn in the simulation.  It is important to have the students apply what they experienced in the simulation, and I believe they would have the opportunity to transfer their understanding of the online titration to the live titration.Have you found a simulation that you would like to use?  Including the link to the simulation, if it is available, would be a great addition to your lesson. Technical Remarks:Your lesson is organized and easy to follow.  I do not see any technical problems or issues.",4
2700,"Useful, but not terrific, government site that provides the basics of advertising law.",3

2705,Interesting if you are interested in early psych.  The pictures were helpful.  I spent about a half an hour here.  It can be educational if the early history of psychology is needed.Technical Remarks: Easy to navigate.,4
2705,This site was interesting in that I never knew what instruments were used in psycology testing. There is a lot of information on this site.Technical Remarks: The site is easy to navigate through. It is a  little plain and could use something to make it more interesting.,4
2705,"I spent about 30 minutes reviewing this site.    The information was very clear and easy to understand. The information would be valuable for someone studying early psychology. Technical Remarks: This site was very informative, however, it was not very interactive.  The pictures were helpful though.",4
2705,"I spent about 30 to 40 minutes reviewing the material on this site. I thought it was very interesting and well written. I think that this site is great for educational purposes, and to enhance teaching and learning. Technical Remarks: It was very easy to access the information, and it was easy reading. People will find this site easy to find information.",5
2705,I spent about 45 minutes reviewing this site. The quality of the content is are educational if you are interested in early technology. It may have potential to enhance teaching if you are studying and learning about early interventions and instruments in psychology. The first time user will be able to obtain the material with ease.,2
2705,This site is great for very anyone who wants to know about the history of psychology. It tells the main people who first started the psychology feild and what there interests were. It is very educational and I think any psychology major should read it.Technical Remarks: The site has one main home page and links to all of it's information. It is technically very easy to use.,4
2705,"I spent 1/2 to 1 hour reviewing this site.  I was interested in the tuning forks. I used them for hearing tests in my A&PII class. It was interesting to read that John Shore invented the tuning fork in 1714. He was the ""lutenist"" at the Chapel Royal. He called it a ""pitchfork"" as he tuned his lute. The site has an on-line cyber museum. It's wonderful that the instruments are shown in color.Technical Remarks: First time users will find it easy to navigate through the site. You will be at a disadvantage only if your computer does not have high quality graphic resolution.  You don't want to miss the details of the pictures.  They are wonderful.",4
2706,(Revised)  General review of the site to compare content with course taught at the undergraduate level.Technical Remarks: This isn't a turnkey site.  However it is a very thorough course outline.  Additional materials are necessary to gnerate a quality course but this is a very good roadmap.Material can be combined with a study of NFPA 101 or Building Codes,4

2712,Interesting website with helpful links and an effective narrative.,4
2713,I used this learning object to introduce some concepts to my first grade class since it has information at varying grade levels. The students found it interesting.  The assignment written by Troy Tenhet would be great for a high school grade level.Technical Remarks:No problems navigating the site.,4
2713,"This article is a nice start, but is not the most up to date...",3
2714,Good resource...Full of data. It is geared for the high school population.,3
2715,Solid resource.,5
2716,This is a versatile learning object and a personal favorite!,5
2717,I used this when I taught 3rd grade. I really like that the data and the phases are actually current.,5
2718,The virtual book is what does it for me.,5
2718,"I enjoyed this site particulary for it's games and activities for students.  I have found many that AI can use in the classroom teaching earth science.  Our students enjoyed creating their own ocean and making their own asteroids.  These activities allow for student participation which helps the English learners relate to the areas of science that are difficult to teach in expository texts.Technical Remarks:The only problem a teacher may face with the ""Making Asteroid"" activities is having a place to bake the asteroids.  Our school has a full size kitchen which allows us to utilize the ovens.  Another solution would be to utilize the ""Sun Pizza oven"" offered on this site to create an oven for the asteroids.  This activity would need to be done during hot climate times in order to bake the asteroids.",4
2719,"My first grade students loved using this site.  The challenge of motivating my students to write was made easier by the Windows to the Universe Journal, Postcards, and ask a Scientist.  They learned about weather, the planets and wanted to learn even more about space in general.  I appreciated being able to use the site to stimulate their interest in space and writing about space.Technical Remarks:The program is easy to navigate and understand.",4
2720,"I spent about an hour surfing through the site and found it most intriguing.  This entertaining, yet interactive and educational site was designed with both the student and educator in mind. The varying activities encompass a good cross-section of the science disciplines and for the student helps create a correlation between theory and application. From an educator?s perspective the site offers completed lesson plans as well as ideas for lessons, some of which come with handout material.   Technical Remarks: The only draw back I found with the site, although vast with resources, was a lack of instruction with some of the activities.",4
2720,"I spent about an hour and a half looking through the site.  I found many very useful activities that could be used for physical science.  I will be studying these further to design activities, assignments and labs. Technical Remarks: Most activities were easy to use and intuitive as far as what was expected.",5
2721,I liked this one; the game would be fun and challenging for students and would really make them think about fractions.  The video segments were interesting; I did have some difficulty getting the video to run.,4
2722,"This looks like a great lesson. I think the technology is used in a way that is helpful and not artificial. Students may have to use PowerPoint and Excel in their futures be in higher education or in their careers. I like that they will be teaching each other a concept. This is another useful skill and real world application. I would recommend including a copy of the rubric you will be giving students. I might have them complete a peer review sheet, so that they can provide feedback to the author.",5
2722,"This lesson involves different types of learning activities.  I like the idea of presenting their powerpoints to one other student.  I think this will make for easier feedback opportunities and a less stressful situation than whole class presentations.  It will also be better in terms of time management.  The ability to use excel spreadsheets is another valuable tool, so the more practice with them, and powerpoint as well, the better.",5
2722,This lesson plan is very clear and logically organized. Great job Dan. Your students will not have any issues following the steps/instructions layed out on the lesson plan. Excel graphs are a wonderful way to explain relationships shuch between two different data sests (position vs time). This will be specially helpful for visual learners.Technical Remarks:No technical issues were encountered.,5
2722,Very professional looking. Nice job!,5
2723,Although this assignment is beyond my current grade level there is enough material to warrant adapting the lesson for my first grade class.Technical Remarks:There were no difficulties in navigating this site or the links it provides.,4
2723,Very information-rich website that enables students to ask an astronomer questions. There are useful links as well. A good site for 7th graders.,4
2724,3-2-1 IMPACT! Pretty interesting way to show perception of stats. I attempted the simulation 10 times and progressively got better. I started out at 72% average error rate then gradually got down to 20%. This shows us that even if something appears to be statistically easy you can gain perspective by analyzing again. I think this would be a great way to introduce stats in a classroom setting because its easy to start up and get right into. I think an expansion into either better graphics or different circumstances of the probability would be a nice touch.Technical Remarks:Initially very interesting and colorful but pretty much a one trick pony.,3
2724,"This was a simulation on how data can be biased. The experiment itself was interesting (I tried it twice)the first time was a suprise just to see how ""off"" my count was to the actual number of hits. It demonstrates human error in data collecting can be a very significant down side for accuracy and outcome of finished data.Technical Remarks:Easy to use, all you have to do is count different colored dots and put the number you come up with in box. System calculates/compares your answer with actual number. It would have been interesting to see if there was a solution or technic to help cut down on errors.",3
2726,"I have used this material for 6 years in Neuroscience classes in Medical schools in 2 different countries - Seychelles and St. Kitts-Nevis. Using this material, Basic Science Medical student's average grade in National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Shelf Exam in Neuroscience reached a peak of 480 (3-digit NBME score), with a Median value of 493 (3-digit NBME score) in the Fall of 2011. This is close to US National average figure.This video was created in Medical University of the Americas in May 2011 by Med 3 Neuroscience students of Summer 2011 batch. It has been in circulation among the students since then. They find it very helpful to learn the material after they have listened to the video lecture. That is why it has been rendered online. ",4

2737,"This is a site has 2 different levels containing different facts about Pluto.  Level 1 gives a description of Pluto’s properties, composition and its moons.  It also discusses when Pluto was demoted from being a planet to a dwarf planet.  There is also an audio function that reads the webpage to students and a short quiz question at the end testing their comprehension.  The audio function also makes this site accessible to students with reading and language difficulties as well as students with vision impairments.  Level 2 gives more detailed explanations of Pluto’s moons and details their composition.  There is also a short quiz at the end to test comprehension, but no audio option.",5

2740,"This site is well constructed, easy to navigate, and has a good site map.  The online virtual tours for Van Gogh, Calder, and Cambodia earn a ranking of 5 on their own.  They are offered in two different formats--virtual reality and no special requirements which allows all to see the exhibits.  The entire site has much to offer those that appreciate art and those that are learning about art and how to view it.  My student teachers and the public school teachers with whom I work are impressed with what is here.  You will return to this site.Technical Remarks: For the virtual tours at this site, you need a frames-enabled browser; 16"" monitor (800 x 600 resolution) or larger; resized window to maximum width at 800 x 600 resolution; bandwidth considerations: file sizes vary from approximately 2k to 150k; allocate as much memory to your browser as possible.  Also, virtual tours can be viewed with version 3.x of QuickTime or higher on any browser version 3.x or higher.  Audio portions of the virtual tour are available in RealAudio (RealPlayer) or wav formats.The opening page of the tour has direct links to any plug-ins or downloads you might need.",5
2741,"All policy makers, science teachers, and teacher educators should refer to these recommendations in deciding what to teach in the science classroom.Technical Remarks: The published book can be read onlione - but a book in hand works better.

2743,"I really did not find much value in using this site.  There was to much of a delay and the sound was not clear.  Maybe someone who is fascinated with science and music, might get some use from this site.  The Jingle Bells song that you are suppose to be able to play did not even sound correct during some parts. You can make the wave form, frequency, and fade change.  You can here the difference and see the actual wave form change. I would not recommend this site to band directors.Technical Remarks: This site takes time to load.  When you click on the keys of the piano keyboard there is a delay, as well as when you use the computer keyboard to play the piano keyboard. You are suppose to be able to change songs and then play them, but I was unable to get it to change songs.",2

If the author has credentials (which he does not provide here) to support or refute Breggin, the materials would have more meaning for students.",2
2744,"This site is entertaining at best and possibly dangerous at worst.  Dr. Breggin is well known in the psychiatric comunity for his strident views.  Be sure to read this link: http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/NegativeBR/breggin.html""Quack Watch"" may be the best summary.",2
2745,"This video is not an assessment tool. It looks like tape of a talk show called Innovations in Education. The host interviewed someone who used problem based learning in his classes. I think it would be difficult to watch the video in a classroom setting because a slider bar must be used to rewind and advance the video. Locating specific segments to show to a class would not be easy.The interview maybe used as an additional reference because the steps of how to use problem based learning were summarized at the bottom of the screen after the guest discussed them. However, they should have been listed altogether again at the end of the show for review. The interview was also unstructured in certain parts especially the discussion of incorporating social media in class websites. Some may find it distracting.",2

2747,"This site is very useful.  My teaching methods students designed a lesson around the Billy Joel song, We Didnt Start the Fire.  Feedback was very favorable from the students.  They all were able to articulate specific historical events or identify people they had not been familiar with.  I would encourage use of this site.  The students claimed that the site was very valuable to their learning experience.Technical Remarks: They claimed that some links were either broken or not helpful, but they didn't seem to think those problems were devastating.",5
2748,"The JASON Project is an excellent site to use a model for elementary preservice teachers in a science methods course.  The previous Jason Projects (e.g., Rainforest Adventures; Journey to the Center of the Earth) are ready to use models or examples for preservice teachers, while the active or future projects allow for interaction and participation of students. The projects models developing fun and educational activities based on the National Educational Standards. Examples of the National Educational Standards that the JASON Projects include:1.	Science as Inquiry: Content Standard A a.	Students should learn about scientific inquiry and develop the abilities needed to perform it.2.	Life Science: Content Standard C a.	Students should develop an understanding about the structure and function of living systems, reproduction and heredity, regulation and behavior, populations and ecosystems, and the diversity and adaptations of organisms. In addition, the JASON Project curricula are aligned with the National Education Standards in Science, Geography, English, and Technology, as well as with state educations standards.Technical Remarks: It is easy to move throughout the site.

2750,"After exploring this interactive toy store for use in my classroom, I have concluded that it is visually pleasing and appropriate for primary students to practice money skills. I liked how the activities could be leveled based on grade.Technical Remarks:My only suggestion would be to clarify directions. Teachers will need to explain directions to primary aged students so that they know how to put items in carts and empty the cart when they are finished.",4
2751,This is a really well organized and helpful site.  I've found it incredibly easy to use and my students love having materials online rather than in a textbook.  The MyClassroom system is great.  Bravo!Technical Remarks: Top notch.,5

This site contains professionally reviewed lessons that are exceptionally accurate and easy to read.  These materials cover interdisciplinary topics and thus are widely applicable to core college and advanced high school courses.  This material very directly improves teaching and is relatively easy to use.  I would rate the overall effectiveness of this material as excellent.Technical Remarks: This site contains text-based lessons, an interactive glossary, animations, news stories, scientific biographies, multimedia, and practice tests all in a single understandable format.  I found the interface very easy to use with virtually no errors.  An excellent resource.",5
2752,This calculator will be very useful in particular situations.  It will not be reviewed by the Teacher Education Board because its use is so specific.,4

2755,"As an elementary teacher I found AAA math website very useful. I plan to use AAA Math practice and drill games with my students as a way to reinforce the skills we learned. The first concept I will teach my students using the website is the concept of money recognition and counting. It is fairly difficult for young children to grasp the concept of money. Not only they have to be able to recognize the coins and they value but they also have to learn how to count by 5s, 10s, and 25s. This websites concept explanations, models and skills building games are well written in language comprehensible to younger students. I found this website educationally significant and it will be a part of my regular classroom learning as a teaching-learning tool. The only thing I would like the authors to think about is to offer the possibility to set up the level of difficulty for each skill practice. For example, on the page Adding Dimes, Nickels, and Pennies, the counting game starts with adding together 9 nickels, 9 dimes, and 17 pennies. These numbers seems to be a little high for beginners. It would be better, if the user or the instructor could set up the number of coins to be used. Technical Remarks: AAA Math contains hundreds of basic math skills. Each page has an explanation and interactive practice. The navigation through the website is very user-friendly. The user can browse by Grade School Level or Math Topics. There are also Index of Exercises and Table of Contents. The only technical note I have is to include a search engine to search through the website by a keyword. I did not encounter any technical problems during my work with AAA math. ",5

Ideas range from a selfie project to tweeting about the day's learning, from making video to creating memes. The ideas are student-centric, and most involve student production. These ideas just provide inspiration;they but do not provide details. The ideas could be shared with students, who can then select ones that intrigue them.",3
2758,This presents a very high level summary of the economic discipline.  The material would serve well as an introduction to economics. ,3
2759,"Sounds realistic and engaging.  You bring up a good point about publishing to the world vs. just to you as the teacher.  I think the idea of a group work project after learning a skill set is a great idea.  The lesson incorporates many different kinds of pedagogy, and many skills sets for students.With the amount of time that it takes to set up a wiki, I wonder how you have them reference this page again.  Would this be something that year after year would get added onto?  How would all students set up a wiki (if this is the main skill set) or is one person setting it up for the group?I am curious to how this turns out for you.",4
2759,"Useful in so many ways.  Not only is the ability to recognize, interperate and understand different types of visual data explored (ACT, MEAP, SAT), but the collaborative aspect is explored as well.  Great lesson!  The wiki collaboration is a nice touch.  I don't have any experience with wikis, and to tell you the truth, after trying to put some of them together for CEP 811 for the first time, I'm not loving this part right now.  I didn't find setting up my own wiki page pleasant at all.  Maybe a bit more patience and time to heal those wounds.  That being said, students may find using wikis a bit difficult if not properly introduced and guided through them.  This is probably for a more familiar wiki user.  My own fears aside, I think this would be a fantastic lesson plan if students were comfortable with the format.Technical Remarks:Even though this pains me to say, more and more emphasis is, and will be, placed on standardized testing.  Many of the questions on the science and math portion of the MEAP, ACT, and SAT are based on data interpretation from graphs, tables and illustrations.  This would be a great way to hit the content areas, but at the same time, introduce and nuture the problem solving aspect of recognizing univarient data.",4

2760,"I explored this site for about an hour and found it quite intersting- but I love learing about birthing alternatives besides the just having a baby in a typical hospital room. This site can be discribed as a main site which gives a bunch of different links for you to go check out, depending upon the topic your researching. Some topics include: The benefits of water birth, Drugs in Labour- what effects do they have?, Pregnancy for vegetarians, Natural nutrition during pregnancy, and so fourth. I found the site extremely informative and helpful since the site does direct you to websites that include pictures, and clearly explains the topics being discussed. I feel that if a student, or a parent-to-be wanted information on child birth, options available, breast feeding, etc. than this site would be extremely educationally significant since there is such an array of topics available. Being a first time user, I found this site easy to use because the topic areas were clearly marked and highlighted, and when the page directed me to the proper web address, it was easy to follow through and arrive at the destination I wanted. I highly recommend this page for people wanting to learn about child birth and all that goes along with it.Technical Remarks: The site was very easy to navigate through for first time users- when the page re-directed me to the proper website for the topic I was researching, it was clearly marked and easy to get to the right page.",5

The information was very well written, very clear and very understandable to anyone from a layperson to a professional therapist.  I am not sure that use of this website would enhance a student's learning or a faculty's teaching.  It would be a good reference for a paper, but it is extremely specific and does not link to other sites regarding Asperger's or spychology in general.

As a ""20-something,"" I am on the bubble between Generation X and the Millennial generation, I find myself stuck between two generations having not truly grown up with the internet or cell phones. I still remember using rotary phones and white walls on tires!  

	I find this article written by Oblinger to be truly insightful. The one issue I find to be most salient is the issue of trial-and-error learning. Our nation has produced a generation of push-click. It is almost as if Millennials have the sense that if something does not work, Lets try it again or try something else until it does function as we want it to. This eventually becomes an issue of sustainability and therein lays two enduring questions: How many resources will this generation exhaust in their trial and error?  When will they figure out where to draw the line if something is actually not feasible and they cannot just keep attempting to push-click to see if it functions?",5

It presents access to several journals and several other research facilities.  The information is fairly advanced and would not be appropriate for an introductory level class, but would be very usefull for an advanced student looking for research materials or writing articles themselves.Technical Remarks: The site was very easy to navigate.   The use of navigation bars at the top is always a nice touch - it helps you keep track of where you are in the site.",3
2797,"This site is interesting and shows the importance of ecological psycology in studying behavior.

There is also a large list of different publications produced by the Center. I spent about an hour leafing through the different links and reading the information on the site. The content of the site was very accurately presented, though, I admit a bit wordy. The site itself was very easy to navigate.

2810,"This is a great activity that allows students to practice a necessary reading skill. Taking the time to first use context clues and then looking the words up in the dictionary can give students the confidence that they really can be successful using context clues to decode meaning in text. This confidence is important for when they are later reading on their own. It is also an activity easy for teachers to use no matter the content. If the teacher is picking the sentences and words, it can easily fit into any unit and with any reading material. The flexibility of this activity is definitely a strength. I also like how the lesson gives a resource for teachers to go to if they choose to use pre-selected sentences that fit specifically for this activity. Scaffolding during class is needed. The teacher would need to do a number of examples with students before having them try it on their own.Technical Remarks:I like how an online and free resource is available for teachers who would like to use pre-selected sentences that fit will with this activity. Kids are able to use an online dictionary. Using computers will give students a little extra motivation and teaches them multiples ways they can find definitions for words.",4
2810,"From a technological teaching perspective, students are using websites to look up unfamiliar words to understand meaning of text. I think by providing students with websites, instead of paper text increases a students’ motivation to learn. Being a 21st century learner, it is also important to teach students skills that they will use in the real world. Providing students with these online resources can really benefit students.From a pedagogical and content teacing perspective, there are clearly stated objectives and goals. This lesson also does a great job of connecting to a students’ real life to provide more meaning and motivation for learning.  I like how students are given the choice of the text they want to interpret. It gives students the freedom they need when learning and makes them feel more of a want to complete the lesson. By giving students the choice of websites allows more avenues for learning to occur by allowing different types of learners to be successful.Technical Remarks:I feel like I would provide more scaffolding throughout the lesson. I think students need to have this process modeled first and there needs to be some support for students who cannot figure out the meaning of the words from the websites. Also, maybe having some peer collaboration towards the end of the lesson could be effective for students. Maybe students could discuss their meaning of the text with their peers to see if they agree with each others’ responses. This might provide for a higher level thinking activity. To add more technology, maybe you could create a Wiki page to have students share their interpretations of their text on so that they could see all their classmates responses. Additionally, that would make it really easy for teachers to assess their students’ understanding of reading for meaning.",4

3. This site is extremely useful for teaching and learning. It’s a great place to go to bury yourself in the math that you need to practice and learn. The amount of material on the site is immense. The tutorials are very helpful. It walks you through step by step and uses colors and pictures to help you better understand and learn. 
4. This site is really easy to use. If your familiar with browsing the internet you will have no problem with this. At the bottom of every page there is a link that says “continued on the next page” which would of course take you to the next page of the tutorial.

2812,"Coolmath.com is an interesting resource. I spent about a half hour using the educational resources (playing the games) and thought that they were quite useful and entertaining. This website markets towards a younger audience.

The quality of the content is good, really fun to explore. The design and graphics were marvelously constructed. You can tell that a lot of hard work and thought were put into it. I wish I had known about this resource in high school! 

Because of the versatility and the fun setting of the website I believe that it would be a great way to help kids and adolescents learn and do well in math. Playing games is a type of positive reinforcement in itself. Learning will definetly be enhanced by this positive and fun resource.

Lastly this resource is highlighted by it's user friendlyness. Its as simple as clicking the subject you interested in and getting several fun, interactive educational games to play (and learn with).",5

I guess by playing it for about four times, and thinking it was my fault that it didn't answer right. Just made me try harder. I think that it is a good teaching tool and that people learn things from the site. I liked the fallowing games: Number fun #1, 2,and Genius test. I found that this was a very fun, the use of numbers and letters to come up with the old sayings. This site is easy to use and very fun to play, I think that it is a great teaching tool and a fun site.The teaching and learning potential is there and has good content for the user to lean and teach to others.

Some of the link went over prime numbers, wind shield factors,calorie burning, sales tax and savings.  These links were pretty basic except for the atmospheric pressure calculator.  The site was very colorful and eye catching.  I would not consider it one of the best learning tools as it does not show nor explain how the formulas are calculated.  It is simply a calculator, you just plug in the numbers and the calculator gives you the answer.  Simple as that.  The site was user friendly and very non-threatening.  I recommend it for fun! ",4

By simplifying each geometry, trignomotry, and algebra concept, the reader can easily understand the math in its simplest form. For example, the Pythagorean Theorem is broken down into its elements through visual aids and catchy phrases. This site proves to be effective in its tutorial purposes, but teaching aid would definitely be necessary.Technical Remarks: The site was easily accessible and the icons were very helpful in locating which concept was needed to explore. In addition, the visuals were effective.",4

I enjoyed reading everything on this site. I was able to relate many of the things such as graphing lines and fractuals to math that I have already learned.Technical Remarks: Accessing coolmath.com was very simple. It was easy to bounce around, yet return to previous pages if I wanted to. If you are the slightest bit familiar in using a compute then it will be easy to access the Merlot site completely and explore different categories, however, if one doesn't even know how to type in a website, then they might have a problem exploring different web pages. I recommend this site for students who have difficulties in math.",5
2812,"Coolmath.com is a super fun site offering a variety of math related recreational tutorials and puzzles!  I selected Number Fun 2 ... walked thru all the steps/questions asked, keep tally of my final number and then was truly shocked that the game was able to guess my age :( - I liked it anyway!  I was able to maneuver around this site with extreme ease, including guidence & explanations provided. I have never really experienced fun while learning about math related subjects.  I believe this site is geared towards a probability approach to math with numerical speculation as a predictable success factor.",5
2812,"I spent two hours on the CoolMath website because it really is ""cool"". According to the homepage, their goal is to make math fun and they really pull it off. They have math mixed in with math games which make it more interesting. Their fonts and colorful graphics make it appealing for kids because my six year old daughter had me playing Connect 4 and 3-D Maze for almost an hour. The screen caught her eye and she was hooked. She even bookmarked the site for her own future use.Technical Remarks: The website is very easy to navigate. Aside from the games, the site also covers serious math subjects such as fractal, functions, graphing, etc. The lessons are very easy to follow and are very detailed. There is something for everyone here because the site is divided into math levels and subject matter. There's even a link for kids, parents, and teachers. I was kind of put off by the ad banners and online store, but I suppose they need to support the website. That is my only minor criticism. Other than that, the sight is very helpful and fun at the same time.",5
2812,"I spent about 45 minutes to an hour playing the games and the other programs they had to offer.  Coolmath.com made math more fun to learn.  People who go to this site will definately enjoy math and will can learn a lot.  I got to figure out payments on loans, also go to figure out my Blood Alcohol Level.  I recommend this to every one.Technical Remarks: I did not find any technical problems",5
2812,"I never found math to be as fun as it is now after exploring the contents of coolmath.com. I spent about a half an hour browsing and playing games that can build a person's math mind. While I was on the site, I not only balanced my check book for the day, but I also figured out my BAC(Blood Alcohol Level) would be if I was to drink three beers, very interesting. So if you ever think that math is boring, take a visit a coolmath.com and you will agree at the end of your visit that math is indeed pretty cool!",5
2812,"I spent quite a bit of time on this site (about an hour) playing different games and reading through the resources.  Not only is the information presented in a fun and creative way; but also the site presents interesting concepts that drag you in. This site would be very useful to anyone struggling to become motivated for math.  The site is easy to use, although a ""search"" capability would be convenient.",5
2812,I spent some time on this site and tried some of the activities. I am a big believer that Math should be fun and could be taught in fun ways. This site gave me the opportunity to experiment with math in different ways. Not only do you get to try different math activities but they tell you how to study for math and become a better math student. In my case that is helpful. The material is easy to use and gives helpful hints incase you get stuck. Anyone who uses this site will have fun and learn too.  Bravo for this site!!! ,4
2813,This is a compendium of all the countries of the world and their historical backgrounds and cultures.  It needs updating but otherwise a very useful reference for any level.,4
2813,"Great material. Extraordinary. I read the information about Chile (I'm Chilean) and although it is slightly out of date, it still is very complete and exact.Really very useful when it comes to learn about a culture or a country.",5
2814,This is not a fre resource,3
2815,This is a television program about nature by a boy who loves science.  Very appealing to children.,5
2816,"This engaging and interactive textbook uses the applied approach, teaching students to apply the legal principles they have learned to fact patterns.  It also contains hundreds of links, illustrations, charts, tables, and diagrams, to break up the text and appeal to various learning styles.",5
2817,I'm amazed to see something as simple as this from our friends at Goddard. I am happy to see that you posted it...great work. I now challenge you to focus the learning object with an actual assignment (lesson plan).,5
2818,"This syllabus is for a course that takes an anthropological approach to literacy, mainly in terms of popular culture and daily life. The syllabus consists largely of readings, which offer intriguing ideas.",3
2819,"I spent about half an hour reading the essays and going through the links and advice column.  There were no activities, and except for the Q&A, no interactive elements to this site.  The content of this website was very sketchy.  The essays were a simple regurgitation of the writings of Albert Ellis and of the simpler concepts of REBT therapy.  The book suggestions were thinly veiled advertisements for the writings of the Psychologist who hosted the site and the responses to the Q&A worried me.This site was not educational nor significant in any way except as a tool for self promotion.  Why it was submitted to an educational website confuses me.  I don't see any redeeming value in this site and don't think that it would be an effective tool for teaching. Technical Remarks: This site was laid out in a very straight forward way.  All the pages were easily accesible from the home page and the tool bars allowed for quick and easy movement through the site.",1
2819,"I really liked this site because it serves two purposes. First it gives you an overview of different types of mental problems people go through, a brief discription of what the problem. Second it provides with helpful hints and ideas how to get rid of that particular problem which range from Stress/Anxiety to Self-Esteem and Depression. Another idea that I really liked was that there were links to places where you can get real help from real psychologists if you think that you cannot help yourself by using the methods and ideas metioned on the site. I also liked the idea that the language used can be understood by anyone, there were no complicated words or phrases that can only be understood by other psychologists. I spent extensive amount of time browsing this site and I think that it is wort while to visit it if your are interested in ways you can aliviate some of mental problems that most people face. I think this site provides a general overview of topics and solutions of different mental problems in simple terms and because of that I think it can be easily understood by anyone.",4
2819,"I spent about 40 minutes going through the information avialable on this site.  The self tests are educational to anyone.  This is a very usefull and informative site.  A student or teacher can take self tests or learn about certain disorders, such as depression.Technical Remarks: Easy to use and read.",4
2819,"This site is a self help site on psychology issues. It helps people reduce stress and depression, overcome addictive behaviors, improve relationships and enhance career and personal satisfaction. I think this site is a great way for someone to get private help on a psychology issue. I am not sure how relable the results are, but it does seem to pretty good. Technical Remarks: The site is very easy to use. You simply click on the information you want and it sends you straight to it. ",4
2820,One of the best demonstrations of how a cyclotron works available.  The nice thing is the applet shows how the particle is boosted in speed at each half-revolution.,5
2821,I love this resource! I have a number of colleagues that deal with WW2 and I will steer them in this direction. I especially love the fact sheets and the supporting bibliography.,5
2821,Contains a really nice online exhibit about Christmas during World War II.,5
2822,"Wow, this is a great resource for anyone who uses Desire @ Learn.  Well done!",5
2823,"A brief review of this site reveals that it provides a useful introduction to ethics in general and the special ethical concerns that arise when using computers. While not an appropriate site to be used as a teaching tool in psychology (where there is much written about moral development), it would certainly be a site to which instructors could refer students to advise them of the relevant issues.",5
2823,"Not long ago, ethical technology questions were only of interest to a very few specialists. But as the use of information technologies spreads throughout society and its importance to our national economies and individual careers grows, everyone will need to make good ethical decisions when using computers. Studies show that persons involved in computer crimes acquire both their interest and skills at an early age. This site contains much valuable information for bringing ethical issues into a practical ""real world"" view. This is an excellent reference site - even if it seems ""dated.""",4
2824,"The information about building an objective was good.  It was easy to read and understand and broke down the different aspects of a good/measurable objective.  However, in my experience knowing what compenents an objective needs to is only half the battle.  The harder part is turning your content into those good objectives and I did not see much in the way of practice or examples that could be followed.",3
2825,Link is bad.Technical Remarks:Link is bad.,1
2825,"The amount of information on this site is enormous.   For those needing information about a paricular unit of measure (no matter how obscure), this should be the first place they visit.",5
2826,"A great article, this just excites me even more to eventually make a trip to witness the Northen lights myself. ",5
2826,This is very interesting. I had no idea that the lights could possibly be making a noise. ,4
2826,The video is very interesting and goes into great detail on the northern lights and the process that takes place.  For many thousands of years it has been a mystery on what and how they formed.  This video may be introduced into a class room of a middle school setting.  ,4
2827,"It's a nice article talking about providing digital accessibility to the people in the third world countries so they can receive both social and economic benefits.  PeopLink.org, a nonprofit organization, is using technology to look for ways to help these people meet their own needs.  It's worth reading.",4
2828,Commercial site with a couple of good articles.,3
2829,"This is one of the sites I use when I work with teachers who will be teaching students during their transition phase (i.e., age 14 and up). I have also recommended it to several of my own students who have learning disabilities. It is an excellent venue for students with disabilities to gain information unique to them and also it has a wide-ranging chat forum on a variety of disability-related issues. The five areas that the site covers are: (a) features, (b) services, (c) socialize, (d) news, and (e) shopping.",3
2830,"Technical Remarks: Many of the links do not work; however, those that work are excellent.",4
2831,Good reference material for intro course in networking and/or computer literacy in general. Easy to navigate and read.,4
2832,"I believe this StAIR does a great job of bridging the auditory element to the visual recognition of the note itself. All links work and I think that is appropriate for the target audience. One area that might be helpful is to add a different visual representation of how many beats the note gets, it could a be a fun area to add a fractional picture of sorts not related to music that student could use as another reference point to draw from outside of music.  ",4
2832,I really learned a lot from your PowerPoint. The graphics and the effects were appropriate for the intended audience and simply people who are new to reading music. I think you also tapped into a few difference learning styles by offering students the ability to hear what a dotted quarter note.  I enjoyed it! Technical Remarks:I thought the font was a good size--especially for younger students.,5
2832,"I really enjoyed this kiosk activity!  I think students will enjoy the variety of music included.  I like that you ask students to listen to the two examples two times each and have them look for something more sophisticated on the second listen.  (The excerpt of orchestra music was beautiful.)   Technical Remarks:The links on the ""One more question"" slide didn't work for me.  I also couldn't get the ""corresponding arrows"" on the review page to work either.  ",4
2832,I am assuming that this material is made for students already learning about music and not for new-commers. At times the information seemed crammed. Those parts could have been broken up for a more clear delivery.Having the auditory compare and contrast element was a great tool.I really enjoyed the variety in assesments. Very cool to utilize several of the senses (visual and sound) to assess the learner.Technical Remarks:The layout and design of the material was simple and easy to follow. The only comment I have is that students can just skip over assesments ny click the next arrow. ,4
2833,Useful way beyond any regular textbook,5
2834,"Educational value is way above that of a regular textbook, besides being highly contemporary",5
2835,Educational value: This is not available in any regular textbook.,5
2836, The increasing globalization concepts were refreshing.  I was thinking you would be teaching me some international finance concepts and I’m looking forward to that in your next lesson plan.  Learning about the east Asian culture and preparing digital timelines using Glogster was exciting and I am always amazed that 11-17 year olds know such about these technologies. Technical Remarks:15 minutes,4
2836,"The need for the assignment was clearly stated and straight to the point. I believe this age group will enjoy creating digital timelines. Having students create a running compilation of current events seems more interesting than just keeping a journal. Students will be able to bring their writing to life. I also like the sense of community you are creating having students visit their classmates blogs.Technical Remarks:I am very interested in how you are going to incorporate Edmodo. I have yet to use this social network. Therefore, I'm not sure how to effectively use the networking tool.",5
2836,"The idea of exploring a global interconnectedness is excellent, and I think you chose the tools wisely for your students to deliver their message! I really like the idea of each group having a different country/region to work on, and I think that a timeline is a great tool for them to visualize such complex information more clearly. My concern is about the construction of their knowledge. Where will they find the information necessary to build their timelines? How will that be structured? Further, in order to build these timelines, what kind of scaffolding techniques will be used to support their reasoning? Since the target audience is Grade 7, specific directions are still needed for students to meet expectations and standards.Technical Remarks:Where will Edmodo be used? It has only been listed under Prerequisite Knowledge.",4
2837,I reviewed the material for 30 minutes and found it to be accurate and consistent with other educational materials on the subject. It was unique in presenting the disorder from a male perspective. I believe it will enhance learning of basic facts about this disorder.      Technical Remarks: The site was easily navigated and appealing to the eye. ,4
2838,"Like the rest of the sites in the author's collection, this site is very  informative, clear, and uses nice graphics (some animated) to illustrate the  points.   Very extensive discussion.  For a nontechnical discussion, this site  should be very helpful.",5
2839,I have used this guide as reference material in a criminal investigation course and have shared it with local law enforcement. Students who have read the material have commented how interesting the guide is and how useful it would be for law enforcement officers.,5
2839,Very good information for processing electronic crime scenes.,4
2840,"1. I spent about a half hour on the site.2. The quality was fantasic, there were several other links of this site3. This is a very good site for both students and teachers, there is more than sufficent educatioanl material on this site.4. Once getting logged onto Merlot the rest is very simple, and enjoyable.Technical Remarks: The site is enough user friendly, but with a technical approach to be able to go deeper in the reasearch.",4
2840,"Very useful.  There were so many graphs and charts to illustrate the topics, which was helpful.  The detail of the pages was great.  The use of statistics was also beneficial.  This site is a great tool for first time users and beyond. Technical Remarks: The only problem I had, was that I found some sites that were under construction.",4
2840,"This is a site you will find yourself going back to over and over again.  When they say there are over 2037 links to choose from, they aren't kidding.  If you want a springboard to several different psychological topics--including continued education, historical information, careers, and various disorders--Encyclopedia of Psychology is your place.  It's all in there. Technical Remarks: No navigational difficulties here.",5
2840,It is a good source of information.  Many topics as well as subtopics are included with links.  It is fairly up to date.  can be a useful tool for the curious who would like to look into some situations.Technical Remarks: Easy to navigate.,4
2841,"Since there is not a diagram for a hospital, it may have been better not to include that explanation. The definitions aren't very clear. For instance, the author mentions business rules, which is great. But, doesn't truly tie an example to the diagram. Lack of discussion on cardinalities is a problem. I wouldn't use it as a teaching tool, unless it was to give students the opportunity to complete it.",3
2841,this is a good web site and it has good graphics showing you how to make diagrams and has other good links.,4
2842,"I've done a similar lab with the Catalase enzyme, but this one looks good too. I'd like to try it in my classroom. It's always better to have a variety of labs even if they are on the same topic. You may find that certain ones work better than others, and it's good to have a back up.",4
2842,Great way to show how enzymes work from a visual perspective.,4
2843,"Power Point download, suitable for those teaching information literacy in the classroom and librarians...",4
2844,Good stuff but you'll need a budget to pay for it.,4
2845,The University of Victoria offered abundant wonderful theories and drills for the teachers and students of ESL.The specific categories of different levels are extremely helpful and practical for me to quote the materials in an effective and efficient way. I believe more and more people will appreciate and benefit from it.,5
2845,"The University of Victoria has shared some great reading lessons which they use with their ELL adult students.  These would be great for secondary ELL students, as well.",4
2846,I haven't used this one but my sophomore aged son uses it almost nightly to support his textbook work.,5
2847,"The site consists of links to 11 very short ethics cases that could be printed and used to generate class discussions.  Each case poses a single question ""What should so and so do?  No teaching notes are included. Technical Remarks: An Internet browser and printer are required.",2
2848,"A complete set of applets demonstrating Euclid's ""Elements.""  Excellent as a reference, and as a learning tool.",5
2849,"While it is certainly possible to find this information yourself in the NCJRS website, having this link makes it easier to get right to the material on family violence.",3
2850,This website is very useful in locating information on federal special educationissues which affect classroom practice. ,3
2851,"One of the best open source resources for students who starting out in the Criminal Justice field.  The site is user friendly and comprehensive.  It can be used to supplement course work or as a reference.  It has a number of clearly written, brief definitions that students find useful.",4
2852,"This is a very ""in your face"" type of website. It was good and very realistic",4
2852,"This site provides a lot of REAL, straight-forward material  for teens and their parents.  It deals with various drugs and adolescent problems.I spent about 30 minutes reading throuhg it. It encourages interaction with the readers.  There are places for viewer input and reactions.Technical Remarks: This site is easy to understand and navigate.  It provides a lot of factual information.",4
2853,Excellent manual for forensic examination of digital evidence.,5
2854,This is an introductory overview of DNA applications to law enforcement; includes several links to related documents.,3
2855,"I am amazed that scientists argue about what can or cannot be considered a hypothesis.  Jerry Pine at CalTech suggests that elementary school teachers should not have students develop hypotheses because the students get the wrong idea when they have to contrive the predictions teachers call hypotheses.  Currently, the federal research grant money demands hypothesis-driven research.  This usually means that the experiment is designed to investigate relationships between an independent and dependent variables.  This resource takes the conservative approach and supports that view of the hypothesis.  Explore here, and you may begin to think that while a hypothesis is an educated guess, not all educated guesses are hypotheses.  Perhaps we should open this discussion between teachers and scientists!Technical Remarks:Both the teacher and student resources can be printed and copied.",5
2856,"I reviewed this information as part of an assignment in my Foundations of Computer Science class.  I have only reviewed this information for its relevance to the information I am currently learning in class.  I found this article to be very informative and well written.  While I did have a difficult time following some of the presentation, I believe that to be due to my lack of knowledge and not ineffectiveness of the article.",4
2857,I found this website to be one of the most helpful and contained the most useful information.  It contained a very large body of information with links to any subject related to what you were searching.  I referenced this website for a majority of my papers.  This was my most favorite website out of all of them!!!,5
2858,"Similar to many applets, and worked no better or worse than most.  I never did figure out what difference it made to switch from a square to a triangle, or why the user is given two squares of the same mass to choose from.",3
2859,"I strongly care about creating learning materials that are accessible to learners of all ability types. By design, this animation is accessible to both hearing and hard-of-hearing/deaf individuals.I also think it does an excellent job of explaining a complex and somewhat dated theory by breaking it down into three easy to understand components.",5
2860,"Eclectic selection--ranging from Volkslieder to Lieder and modern pop music--with good accompanying materials.  Includes song texts (unfortunately no audio files), vocabulary (including links to off-site dictionaries), questions, grammar exercises (although not necessarily integrated with specific texts), and external links (more info on the artists, other grammar sites, etc.).  The grammar part is an overview of the basics in English (however, some explanations may be too technical for the occasional, average user).  Users will profit not only from having texts available but from the added materials.Technical Remarks: Straightforward, although inconsistent presentation (too many different backgrounds for my taste) should not pose major problems for visitors.  No fancy, useless interface. Some of the grammar tables would benefit from a review of the underlying HTML (to fill all fields), and all text does not have to be centered... (left aligned makes reading easier).",3
2861,"Simply a selection of fonts (German font names, e.g. ""Magdeburg"") that can be downloaded.  Possibly useful in teaching/learning about culture (esp. for Schreibschrift, Fraktur, and Suetterlin), but not language or literature (other than it being helpful in learning how to read these types of fonts in older books etc.)Technical Remarks: Easy to install, particularly if one has done it once before).  Requires an un-ZIP program (link to one is provided).  ",3
2862,"I like that the students can experience other people's blogs to find out what other opinions are.  It would be a valuable experience to compare blogs with facts and ""textbook"" knowledge.  The integration of using a posting site such as Ning would be an enjoyable activity for most students and could increase participation for students who don't like to give presentations or normally don't speak up in class.  I noticed that Twitter was listed as a technology to be used but did not see it in the assignment, I'm guessing that the teacher would have a more detailed explaination and guidelines for the class.",4
2863,"This WordPress blog is by a sustainable librarian who is passionate about helping to improve community, exchange and relationship by helping people protect and improve the Earth. Include an inspiring TED Talk.",5
2864,"This site takes you to a ""lesson plan"" template. ",3
2864,The lesson is straightforward and clearly outlines the desired outcomes. The lesson makes sense from a pedagogic standpoint and is easy to follow. This lesson does a great job of outlining the rationale behind the required tasks. I like the idea of requiring students to share their calendar and demonstrate their learning.Technical Remarks:This lesson plan loaded perfect and the formatting and layout are all excellent.,4
2864,Great lesson to teach such an important and lifelong skill. The lesson was well organized. The real-world application will engage the students and assist them with developing the skills needed for high school and beyond. The assignments were well aligned with the lesson. I especially liked the objective of sharing the calendar with teacher and PARENTS. This is also a great way for the students to be the teachers in instructing parents how to use the Google Apps.Technical Remarks:no issues,4
2865,"The Google Drive App for iOS works well for creating, organizing, sharing, and collaborating on documents.  I have used it extensively for working on documents in real-time and asynchronously with our faculty learning communities.  Unfortunately, you don't always have the same editing and viewing capabilities as you would on a desktop machine or even via the Google Chrome browser on your iOS device.  For example, tables don't display within Word docs.  However, the app is easy to navigate and a great tool overall.",4
2866,This is a great site for teaching web page design. This graphic library includes tons of useful backgrounds and graphics image files.,4

2869,"I don't think this would be applicable to middle school, since it's subject material could get confusing for them.",4
2870,"This is an interesting look at the history of the Internet, with major events presented chronologically. The site is kept up to date, with new usage figures being added regularly. Technical Remarks: Presentation is primarily textual, so there are essentially no barriers to this site being used by anyone.",5
2870,Excellent reference for a computer literacy or Internet related course. I have used it as a demo during class and/or as a supplement.,4
2871," This is supplemental material from a science textbook.  Aside from textbook information, there are multimedia presentations images, diagrams and graphs all organized by topic for easy incorporation into lessons, worksheets, and presentations.  Worksheets and assessments are also included.  Videos and canned presentations can be shown to students or students can access the site on their own.  A solid resource. ",3

2873,"There is not too much math or mathematical equations involved, but that is understandable as it is an overview of a very techinical topic. I had no idea how intricate of a system is involved with a CD! Anyone who reads this article will learn MANY things.Technical Remarks:So great to navigate through. Each section prepares you for the next section. Language is simple so anyone can follow and be entertained. The article itself has many parts, but it is never dry; it always keep you interested. The diagrams, examples, and similies are very relevant and helpful!",5
2874,"Many students have difficulty imagining how a piece of hardware actually works, and this Web site gives a good explanation for CD-ROM drives and disks.

I read the entire article and found it to be well written with applicable graphics and references to known operating systems and known viruses.Technical Remarks: The technical components of the tutorial seemed to be correct. Material of this type can become dated very quickly.,5

As it is a tutorial, not a simulation, there were no hands-on activities associated with it.How Web Animation Works does a very good job of describing the various types of animation currently used on the web (including gif, DHTML, java applets, browser plug-ins, video, Flash and Shockwave) as well as a description of what's coming (3-D Graphics). It is written in easy-to-understand language, so novices have no trouble following along. Although the audience has been listed as being college and professional, I think that anyone already familiar with web animation would find this introductory lesson a little too simple.One thing that I didn't like was that the interface was very commercial. Although the document itself was plain text with appropriate graphics, along both sides of the browser window were colorful boxes full of blinking buttons and links to other sites. It didn't look very educationally professional.",4
2879,"This is a great resource for understanding and identifying triangles.  The use of quality graphics, and thoughtful design neither detracted from the learning process, nor confused the learner on what to do next.  The creator did a great job of setting clear objectives for the student, and giving them direction on how to navigate during the lesson.  I do think there was an opportunity missed to outline the State Guidelines in which this resource covers.  Not for the student, but so that any teacher, in state or out of state, can relate it to the guidelines I which they are held accountable.  The menu system provided excellent opportunity for the student to go back and review previous lessons, and allowed them to explore at their own path at their own pace.The quiz was a great opportunity for the student to review what they have learned, and I really enjoyed how when giving an incorrect answer you provide instant feedback, and timely questions to get the student thinking about the correct answer.  I was a bit startled by the sound at first, and had I not had my speakers on, I wouldn’t have known there was any feedback at all.  That is something to consider when looking at UDL.  Just informing the student early that audio is present would likely be enough.  One last thing, and this is minor, on slide 7 you ask the student to point to the two obtuse angles.  The one that points to the envelope, is actually pointing to an area where there are 3 different angles, and your arrow appears to point to the flap of the envelope, not the outside corner of the envelope.  It took me a bit to realize I was looking at the wrong angle.Overall, this is a great resource that I would suggest using in classrooms.  Both Virtually and Face-to-Face.   ",4
2879,"This is a great interactive tool for 5th graders.  It provides varied ways to interact as well as helps to illustrate key concepts.  I also like that there is a short assessment at the end that gives instant feedback for students.The objective is clearly stated in on the first slide and the menu of options is easy to understand. I think this will be a great visual review for studets as they work independtly.Technical Remarks:I found some of the ""special effects"" did not work unless you hit the object in just the right spot. I also felt like it was hard to figure out how to get out of certain pages if you decided you did not want to practice that content anymore. I was also confused as to whether or not I got some of the answers right on the practice.  It was not self-correcting, nor did it make a sound to tell me it was wrong.",4
2879,"Wow! This is a great STAIR designed for 5th graders. Ruth, you took a difficult concept for students to learn by allowing them to visualize by using many examples, including real life examples and providing immediate feedback. Not only were they told right or wrong, you gave an explanation to why they got an answer wrong if and when they chose the wrong answer. I student taught in 5th grade and think that many of the students would have had no trouble going through this STAIR and getting something out of it. However, I do think that there may be that handful that would have had a hard time reading the content. I created my STAIR for 3rd grade and think I have the same problem with mine. I actually am going to be teaching 3rd and 4th grade this upcoming school year and may utilize the core of your presentation during a geometry unit. I think this would look great on the smartboard for the whole class to do together as well as individually.I love the layout that you used with the menu homepage. The students knew exactly what they had to do and where they were at, at all times. The navigation was great, the sound was great, and the topic was great. You hit a lot of different learning styles but could be difficult for the lower math students to do on their own.",5
2879,I thought it was a good topic to choose.  It is a topic where it is easy to have visual (and can be very helpful) and and you did a good job using them to explain the different angles and triangles.  I like the real world examples.Technical Remarks:I had a hard time navigating.  The navigating buttons didn't seem to work for me.  Also when I tried to do the quiz I didn't always know if the answer I gave was correct.  There was overlap in the writing on some of the pages.,3
2879,"This was a great Stair for teaching triangles. I'd like to use it this year in my Grade 3 class. I like the use of different teaching strategies such as students trying their own knowledge and also testing themselves without a wrong answer page that makes them feel unsuccessful. The parts where students read to understand and other parts where they learn by exploring what they think are both great for different learners. The UDL strategies having some visual movements and audio explanations also really benefit all types of learners. The colors were bright and inviting and there was a nice color theme throughout. The Stair was easy to navigate always having the ""home"" button as an option.Technical Remarks:Having so many sounds for right or wrong answers on the check your work pages was a bit confusing. Perhaps you could choose two for each so that students would know if they are making a correct selction, although, for the most part it was obvious. I also felt that students could easily skip parts as nothing stopped them from just going on. This may be a good thing or may allow some students to skp the whole thing.",4
2879,"Though this StAIR module is designed for 5th graders, I think some of the slides had too many words.  If I were to remember how I was as a fifth grader, I could picture myself getting overwhelmed when I see a ton of words.  (i.e. when reading about the definition of an acute angle…maybe make that into 2 slides).  However, I do think this StAIR executes its goal in explaining to the students the 3 different types of angels and 3 different  types of triangles by their angle size and side length, as well as reviewing congruency triangles.  This lesson provides lots of vital vocabulary that will be repeated throughout their math career.  This presentation hits and drills these terms, which is very beneficial to not only them, but the teacher so he/she won’t have to repeat themselves and will know that his/her students understand the word.  Being a math teacher myself, (I teach high school Algebra) I think understanding the vocabulary is one of the most important parts.  If you don’t understand the “lingo” in math, you will get nowhere.  It is a must! One thing that I really adored about this module is  the visuals. Having the students click on image that displayed examples of certain types of angles and listening  for  whether they got it correct by a ‘ding’ or incorrect by a ‘boom.’ I really enjoyed that  partake and I know fifth graders would really find it engaging and entertaining.  Plus, it reinforces the fact that math surrounds us and students can recognize these different types of angles anywhere they go.   Technical Remarks:On the technical aspect, I think this StAIR did a fine job with sounds.  But when it came to the practice portion I enjoyed the sound, but I also think there needs to be some sort of slide letting the students know if they got it correct or not.  The sounds were kind of hard to hear.  I also think some explanations could be good. Especially because it is for elementary students.  I think to spurse it up a video would be an excellent idea. Overall though, I think you did an excellent job and recommend you using this for your students this coming fall. Good job!  ",4
2880,"I reviewed the material on the web link rather thoroughly, including reading the related articles and forum links in the left hand column.  I then reviewed the main page of this website, Kids Source (www.kidssource.com),  and its? contents.  I spend approximately 2 hours reviewing and reading this website. The web pages on infant day care and the relevant links were informative but, outdated.  The most recent studies cited are from 1984-87.  For example, the site gives a very interesting statistic that 47% of mothers with children under 2 years are working mothers.  That information is insightful, but from 1984.  Can anyone find a more recent statistic on the subject from another site?  One helpful web page was a ""Survival Information for Babysitters"" template which provides babysitters with a concise look at all of the information they could need in an emergency.  The potential effectiveness of this specific series of web pages site in enhancing teaching and learning is limited due to the lack of recent data.  This is unfortunate as the content is organized well and easy to read. Technical Remarks: First time users will find this site easy to navigate.  The forums section has great potential for parents and expectant parents. They can post a question on a topic of concern for others to lend them advice.",2

Information that isn't included in the site can be found by some of the links on the sight.  This is not however one of the most educational sights out there.  The material is presented well, but there are even more issues surronding child day care.Technical Remarks: This sight can be used by a first time user with no problems.",4
2880,I didn't spend a lot of time reviewing the materials because it wasn't really long. This was high quality because the sources were cited.

Technical Remarks: I did not come to any problems connecting with this web site.  I believe this site was well put together. ",4
2880,"While not a very interactive site, it has a LOT of material about day care and the different issues revolving around it. I found it very interesting. While not necessarily a topic that would be taught to many -- college students and professors may find it an interesting resource for a topic in class. The site is basically a reference tool, so there is little emphasis on applied or active learning. While, it still is an excellent site.",4
2880,I spent about 20-30 minutes on this site because it is chock full of information on daycare.  I feel this site is very informative especially to those of us studying child development or those of us who are mothers.,5
2881,"As I began browsing Merlot's mathematics section, I came upon Peter Suber's ""Infinite Reflections."" I found his material extremely mind boggling only because the mathematical vocabulary he used confused me. Besides the vocabulary difficulty, I thought ""Infinite Reflections"" was interesting and worthy of the time i spent on it. Even though I've never been one to think of math outside the classroom, the concept of infinity has always intrigued me. ""How can a number go on forever? How do we really know that it goes on forever? Have we tested it? Has human kind ever counted that far out?"" is what I would constantly ask myself in high school when I learned about the concept of infinity. The material effected my point of views on mathematics, but it broadened the way I saw everything else besides math as well. When it referred to sets, subsets and philosophy, my math class came into mind. From my perspective, I found that although at times our minds cannot imagine or visualize infinite things, we are always capable of understanding them. ""Infinite Reflections"" gave a great explanation to my interpretation through a mathematical view of infinity. 

After taking a minute to soak up the information and thought provoking concepts, I believe students in high school and college will find this material mentally enhancing; mathematically as well as philosophically.",4

2892,"Outstanding pedagogy.  Excellent choice of topics.  Integrates culture with science exquisitely!  I found these elements to be of significant value in this course:  (1) chemistry that relates to the real everyday world plus the chemistry of semiconductors, crystals, and biology (we are polymers!) (2) At every opportunity Sadoway points out how chemistry can be engineered for desired properties like recyclability or price (3) Sadoway's lectures are clear and crisp (only slightly more material than I could absorb in a sitting) (4) Sadoway always brings in culture: giving human histories, tales of ethics, playing music and clips from movies: he relates the subject to the humanities (5) professionalism:  Sadoway models the values, ethics, and consideration of details that we need in future engineers or scientists.Technical Remarks:Quality videography.",5

2896,"This is an excellent learning tool for kids of all ages. This tool can be used in a variety of lessons. There are many different options that can be used for both support and enrichment. This includes six clock faces, elapsed start and finish times, and twelve buttons for changing the time on the analog clock. These buttons are color coded to match the hands on the analog clock, which is a great idea for helping students make connections between the minute and hour hands. I particularly like that this tool offers time in three different formats. Students can easily check their understanding and answers at the click of a button.  One suggestion would be to include a button that randomizes the time of the clock. Overall, I think it is a good fun tool that can be used to teach students how to tell and write time! Technical Remarks:Everything is accurate and easy to use. All tools are concise. The clock hands point directly to each minute. When loading or refreshing tool, the analog clock always automatically points to the accurate time. The analog, digital, and sentence formats are always synced. ",5

2936,By the author (Donald Shaw): An excellent visual review/practice before the lab practical.  I had spent many hours to make the document as excellent as it can be.  I hope you find it helpful as well.,5
2937,The website itself was okay. The materials weren't really precise and it could be more put together.The information was somewhat informative though.Technical Remarks:The technical aspect of the website was okay.Teh webmaster need to do some more work though.,4
2938,"Not only is this a tremendous site for kids with learning disabilities, it is a great teaching tool for people in training to become teachers - both special education and general education teachers.  In the ""Art Gallery"" and ""KidZone Magazine"" sections, samples of work done by kids with learning disabilities can be viewed.  Many times teachers in training have no idea what typical work from this population might look like.  This can be very eye-opening!  In ""Listen Up!,"" you can listen to questions about IEP meetings being explained in very straightforward language.  ""Read Up!"" and ""Speak Up!"" are excellent repositoriesof materials for new teachers to share with their young students.  Finally, ""Interact Up!"" has 2 links which my teachers have found very useful.  There is asimulation of what some individuals with learning disabilities see when they read.  You can then click on another link to see the actual reading sample.  Thesecond item is a quiz about famous people who have learning disabilities.  Students always feel better about themselves when they learn that Winston Churchill and Tom Cruise also had/have learning disabilities.  Both of the activities are very effective when used with a general education audience.Technical Remarks: The ""Listen Up!"" section of this site requires RealPlayer.",5

2941,The material is very well organized. ,3
2942,"I found this lesson to be an outstanding example of helping students to think critically while teaching a core concept critical to all science instruction.   By allowing students to choose a problem/issue to investigate using the scientific method, the author took great strides to increase student enagement.  Student engagement according to research is critical for student success.I found the pedagogy supported the lesson by providing appropriate scaffolding.  Teacher lead lecture/discussion moving eventually to group activities that encouraged creativity made for a comfortable and social environment which speaks to the social and emotional aspects of learning.If I could offer some suggestions, I would insure the lesson included a few more audio and video supports that could help the more challenged learners to grasp the concept of the lesson.  Also, if possible, I would provide some examples of examplar presentations from the past.  Or as an extention, after groups present the material using technology, let volunteers carry out their investigation in real time.Great lesson!Technical Remarks:The lesson is saved ina PDF format and opened without issue.",5
2942,"This a great lesson plan that focuses on giving students the opportunity to learn and then apply the rules of the scientific method.  Positives are the variety of pedagogies used, from lecture group work and the ability to present at the end.Student enthusiasm and buy in for the project are encouraged through giving the students choices.  Most importantly in the topic they will choose to work on and secondly in the variety of technologies which are made available to use.The use of a rubric will guide students as they prepare their final product as foreseen in UDL guidelines.  I believe that the use of peer helpers when technology issues present themselves is the way to go.  It empowers students to be the expert and encourages their confidence.A possible suggestion for an alternative approach to the presentation would be to have students make their own individual products based on their collaborative research. Technical Remarks:The text is a straightforward lesson plan in PDF format.",4
2943,"The music is appropriate for the context of the video.  You give background knowledge along with current ways to use WebQuest.  I like the transitions you use to each slide and the way you have separated your content into sections.  The content is useful.  You explain WebQuests, give examples to help convey your points, and explain how to present information to students.The use of screencast complements the information presented in the video.Is there a written version of this video so that people could refer to that as well?  It would be nice to have that information there to complement the video.  Also if you could have a picture of the author at the beginning, that would a way to the participants to connect to the author.",5
2943,"I would rate the ease of use a 10 out of 10 after spending about 9 minutes watching and listening to the Webcast presentation/quiz on Camtasia.   The music during tranistions and the images, like the Wordle are a nice addition to keep the viewer enaged.  The history of Webquests and application was helpful as reminders of this ""old"" technology tool (it is old coming form 1995, right?)  :)I also thought the small chunks of lecture and illustrations broken up by quizzes is a nice way to review and learn the who, what, where, when, why and how of Webquests. I even had a chance to look at my answers, and if they were wrong, I could re-watch and listen to the video segment.  I would use this is a class with pre-service teachers for sure, or as a nice addition to a website on tech tools for teachers!  ",5
2943,"Craig,Great job with the video and presentation of your STAIR.  The presentation did a great job of showing the creation and utilization process of webquests.  I have started using them in my classroom and with the use of your video I should be able to start working on creating my own.  Your presentation of the material in both video and verbal formay is nice for learners and then you provide time for them to check their understanding and allow them to review before going forward.  When I first loaded your video I felt that I was watching a professional video for a webquest website.  Thanks for the great resource.Corbin ",5
2943,"Craig, I think your StAIR project is amazing!  The video is very easy to use and does a great job of breaking down the different sections of a WebQuest all the while reminding the audience that their audience when creating a WebQuest is their students.  I think the quizzes would be a great way to help keep students engaged and work very well in your project, but since the audience is other teachers, I wonder if it's really necessary to test to see whether they are learning but it's a great demonstration of how quizzes can be used in this type of project.  There's one main section in the video where the talking seems to go on for much longer than the other parts and I was wondering if there may be something else you could put in there besides a screen shot of the website to help keep the audience more engaged throught that large section.  For example, you may be able to include something like presentation slides that cover some of the main topics that you were discussing during that time.  Overall, great job!",4

2959,"I spent approximately 45 minutes going through the site.  There are good articles written by classroom teachers that would be helpful to practitioners.The quality of content:The advice is based on classroom experiences and the opinions of those with much teaching experience.  Having said that, there are examples where the opinions do not address the issues in enough depth.  For example, the opinions about timed tests are a bit narrow.  There is no mention of when a timed test might be of benefit...and there are some instances.  Similarly the discussion about the use of calculators does not take graphing calculators into account.  It presents an opinion on using calculators as if the only type of calculator is a four-function calculator.The articles written by classroom teachers can provide some good ideas for effective learning activities.  For example, I enjoyed reading ""Telephone Number Totals"" by Bonnie Tank and Lynne Zolli.The parent site, Math Solutions Online  at http://www.mathsolutions.com/index.html , offers more resources and information for teachers.Technical Remarks: Very easy to use this web site.",4

2961,"I'd highly recomment this site to any parent or teacher trying to convince kids to do math in a fun way. With todays children growing up in a technological world, its only natural to have a math game for grades 6-8 on the internet. Unlike math books that have blatant numbers that will bore a child, this game (math frog)is a good way to interact and learn about math without using numbers but frogs instead. I played this for about 10 minutes and I would recommend it to anyone kid who want's to improve his mathematical skills and have fun at the same time!",5
2962,"One of my favorite topics, matrix.  This site is use full at giving the basics on how to multiply and the  rules of multiplying matrix's. I like how it highlights the equation inputs with the outputs making it easier to remember the steps to be taken. This method was used in the class with my Finite math professor.  He was able to explain and illustrate this method and make it easy for us to re-identify it on our examinations.Technical Remarks:This site is very short. Easy to get to and definitely easy to use.",4
2962,"After browsing the Merlot website for at least 30 minutes, I came across to this website. It educates us about Matrix Multiplication that I have studied in my finite mathematics class. Multiplying matrices are really easy, but when u get the concept. It also can be tricky if you do not know how to solve it the right way. This website gives us more information on how to multiply matrices together. First, it tells us to multiply a row matrix with a column matrix of the same length. It also shows us an example on how to work through a matrices problem. I spent a few hours in understanding the material from this website and compared it to how I understood in my finite mathematics class. This is an excellent website because it has visuals, if you are not an English speaker you can still understand the concept by looking at the visuals. I think that Merlot has some great information that can educate us and help us understanding the material better. At last I would like to say that, this is a great resource for the students who have trouble understanding the concept of Matrix Multiplication.",5
2962,"I spent about 15 minutes reviewing and testing my knowledge on this webpage and thought this was one of the better sites I've discovered on MERLOT.  The site is a brief introduction to multiplying matrices and the concepts were clear, easy to follow and the material is presented with simple explanations and excellent visuals. This site would have made my life a lot easier when I was learning matrix multiplication. This website would definitely be effective in enhancing a student's learning because it was interactive, making solving the application easy to follow and the visual highlights reinforce the material. First time users will find the software easy to use because its straightforward and very user-friendly.",5
2963,This material was very interisting to me. When I first opened the web site I was a little confused on how to navigate through the material but once I figured it out I checked out some of the web pages as well as some of the peer reviews and realized that even though I didn't quite understand what I was looking at I was interested to find out more.Technical Remarks:The web site drew me in and I thought it was set up very well especially if you are a beginner. This allowed me the opportunity to try the different aspects of the web site.,3
2964,"This website is written for someone without a background in physics.  They give the reader an understanding of the operation of the microwaves by making analogies to other physical phenomenon that the reader might already be familiar with.  It covers several questions within the dialogue that a reader might ask him/her self as they read along.  In doing so, the article addresses several topics that are interesting and comprehensible to physics enthusiasts and novices alike!Technical Remarks: This website is well designed and easy to use (as long as your computer will load the Java applets)  The interactive nature is not only fun, but it gives a virtual ""hands on"" demonstration of the physics they are describing.",4
2964,"Although I'm a relatively inexperienced computer user, I found this tutorial on microwave ovens not only easy to use but fun to use as well. The tutorial begins with a ""kitchen laboratory"" setting where the user can demonstrate perhaps the most well known but misunderstood phenomenon of the microwave oven: ""hot"" and ""cold' spots (or the unevenly cooked burrito).From here, the user can proceed through a series of sub-tutorials (Note: the user may feel his way through each of these sub-tutorials and determine what he does and does not understand so that he can efficiently reach a final understanding of how the microwave operates and the physics behind microwave heating.Some of the material covered in the sub-tutorials includes: electromagnetic waves; electrical forces; oscillating charges; wave characteristics such as interference, superposition, and reflection; and finally how electromagnetic waves effect water molecules and how these effects translate into microwave heating.I found each sub-tutorial to be clear and a logical extension of the previous sub-tutorial with an ultimate goal in mind: to understand the phenomenon of hot and cold spots and how it is that material substance heats up in a microwave oven.Technical Remarks:I found this tutorial extremely easy to use. The user can move freely throughout the tutorial without being locked into any sub-tutorial that he might find either too easy or too difficult.The graphics and interactive capabilites are excellent as well as enlighteneing. I give  this tutorial on Microwave Ovens by Physics 2000 the highest rating of five stars.",5
2964,This was probably the most well crafted web-sight I have visited to date.  The only technical difficulty I encountered was one disconnected URL (out of the dozen or so I tried).At first I felt a little cheated by the exclusively qualitative descriptions but the link pages satisfied most of my desire for more rigorous descriptions and in the end I had to conclude that the lack of math did in fact add to the clarity and the broad appeal of the sight. ,4
2964,"Aimed at those without a technical Physics background, this demonstration serves its purpose quite well. Technical Remarks: The demonstrations are easily graspable, with very realistic, everyday analogies. The ideas are put forth in a relaxed, conversational manner.This format allows one to easily understand very basic scientific principles, not just how a microwave oven operates.    ",4
2964,"Like other applets by the same authors, this one is professionaly done with nice graphics, very clear explanations, and applets that work well.",5
2965,"I spent well over an hour browsing this site..it's wonderful.  It explains alot of possibilities your facing at this time of life.  Very informative.Technical Remarks: easy to navigate, you can go to specific areas or browse the whole thing",5
2965,I spent about 15 minutes on this site.  I thought that this site provided a lot of information for people who are going through midlife.  I think that this site can help someone learn more about this topic.  Technical Remarks: This is a very easy site to get around in.,4
2966,"This app is specifically for the iPhone. The information and clean design allow you to get to know the Musuem of Modern Art from near or far.

I have used it in classes with my student teachers with very positive results.Technical Remarks:Compatible with the iPad. Requires iOS 4.2 or higher.",5
2968,"According to American cultural anthropologist Edward Hall, author of the book ""Beyond Culture,"" societies differ in two key ways: context and organization.  The Monochronic/Polychronic Self Test is a very useful in-class exercise that can help students in an International Business class or Business Etiquette class understand cultural differences associated with how societies organize time.  For example, monochronic culltures include the United States and Northern Europe, whereas Mexico and Latin America tend to be polychronic.  Understanding cultural differrences is key to being able to successfully conduct business on an international basis.  To be used for research purposes, however, instructors would need to ascertain the reliability and validity of the instrument.",3

The Doodle Pad feature is fun to try out and is great for early experiences with composition as well.  This is a great way to preview the software before making the purchase!  I believe it is highly effective for introducing and reviewing beginning concepts and is quite easy to navigate.",5
2970,"We have used this program at the middle school I teach at for a couple of years.  We use it in band, chorus, and general music.  It is a superb program.  I would highly recommend every middle school program to purchase the program.  It teaches the fundamentals of music with 24 Lessons and 24 Games.  An animated character named, Maestro Max, guides you through the lessons.  After you complete a Lesson, you have the option to play a game that allows you to practice the knowledge and skills you learned in the lesson.  You can start at the beginning or anywhere in between.  You can actually track a student's progress by putting in the student's name and it will show you at what level the student is and how well they played the games. You can even print out a progress chart for each student. It is truly a great interactive music program for beginners, no matter what their age.Technical Remarks: Once you get to this site, you can download a demo version of the program.  You will need to know what operating system you are using. It will work on Windows or Macintosh and can be networked. You will also have to fill in some personal information such as your name and address.  In order to get the full version of the program, you will have to pay for it. A good set of headphones would also be recommended.",5
2971,"I am a middle school band director and found this sight to be rather dull and not much sense in using it.  However, for young students (up to age 6) this sight might be okay,  but older students and adults would probably feel like me in looking at it.  It does use real instrument sounds--not synthesized sounds, which is a big plus in my book.  It allows you to listen to each instrument when you click on it and then if you move it back in the general vicinity of its original spot, it lets you here the sound again.Technical Remarks: It does take a little while to load and I was using a high speed connection.  It was stated on the page that it did take a little while to load and that you needed java support for it to work correctly. I appreciated this being stated at the beginning.",3
2972,I like this lesson because you can use to show how genes are involved in creating a unique fruit fly.,4
2972,A good site that demonstrates mutations that occur in one of the most commonly studied species when it comes to genetics.,4
2972,I think this is a beneficial source if there's a fruit fly lab to go along with it.  Sometimes it's hard to see the mutations of the flies and students have trouble understanding what to look for in the lab.  With these diagrams they have a general idea of what kinds of mutations to observe.,4
2973,"The NCES site holds a great deal of information.  Higher Ed. instructors, teachers, and student teachers can all find useful statistical information here.  Higher Ed. instructors can make use of this site with their student teachers by having them explore the links, especially the one called Students' Classrooms. Within this site are games and activities that can be used in a range K-12 lessons.  Many deal with collecting data and analyzing it, but the Multimedia Playhouse link ties art and math together. ",4
2974,"This site was a very well put together clearing house for information on Fetal Alcholol Syndrome.  The materials were very comprehensive and included up to date bulletins on new research and therapies.    I think this would be a good introductory site for someone interested in this topic.Technical Remarks: This site was very simply laid out with navigational butons located on the side. The labels were not clear for some of the links so I did not know where I was going sometimes, but it was easy to backtrack home.",3
2974,"I spent about 20 minutes reviewing the material.  I felt the quality was high as it explained what it was and answered frequently asked questions.  It was a good teaching and learning tool becuase it had the most frequently asked questions with good, easily understandable answers.  Technical Remarks: I think this site was easy to use and I also think first time users will find it easily accessible too.  ",4
2974,1.  I spent about 15 minutes looking at the site.2.  The site seems to present concepts and models that are educationally significant.  3.  I think that this site could really help enhance both tecahing and learning.  It answers a lot of questions that people may have avout FAS.   4.  The site is easy to use.  ,4
2975,"I have used this material for 6 years in Neuroscience classes in Medical schools in 2 different countries - Seychelles and St. Kitts-Nevis.

2977,A good way to start thinking of the many ways one can demonstrate Newton's Laws. I used it as a springboard for my imagination during my lesson planning process. These lessons would need to be a little more detailed to stand alone.,4
2978,Good visuals and minimal wording which makes it a helpful addition to a lesson. Could be displayed on the overhead as a educator goes through the pages of this website with a class.,3
2979,This site was great.  I spent alot of time reading in here.  The information about Autism was very interesting.  I downloaded some to give to parents of children with Autism.Technical Remarks: Easy to access.  Will definately benefit all that explore.  A person could spend hours here.,5
2979,"I use this site all the time. I would say many of hours were spent searching for information on all different topics. I truely recommend this site for anyone doing research in the area of mental health. Technical Remarks: Extremely easy to navigate. Has ""alot"" of valuable information for both school and personal use.  ",5
2980,"Apparently the APA style is no longer available in free accounts...that makes the site less desirable, since my students are required to use that style for references.",2
2981,It's a good article about normalization.  The article uses an example to explain why first normal form is required and how it is created.   ,5
2982,"I spent an hour reading this paper.  This whitepaper is a very well written and organized ?tie-together? for object based analysis, development, and design.  It doesn?t go into deep detail about the various key techniques (UML, use-cases, sequence diagrams, or code) because there are already books filled with information about them, but rather details how to tie them together into a cohesive toolset.  Following the examples given will prevent diagrams from becoming useless overhead and will allow them to be used as valuable development tools.",5
2982,"Teaches a language independent, formal notation for the important features of  OO design process. Easy to read and very informative.",4
2982,Good primary introduction about system modelling of information system.Technical Remarks: This article is tutorial for developers of object oriented languages. It briefly introduces UML and modelling concepts with examples. This is good introduction to already experienced developers.,3

2984,This is a very useful nteworking tool that helps audiovisual catalogers keep up with all the changes in cataloging non-print materials.,4
2985,I did not care for this site.  It was simply informational and did not have any links going anywhere.  Also there were no tutorials to learn by.,3
2985,"This site was way too busy for me.  Every bit of information was on the home page.  I would prefer to see one category going to another and another.  All information was displayed on the home page.  I was expecting information on Ecommerce and saw information on the left side like Accounting Degrees? And many, many more.  Technical Remarks: After displaying the Home Page the screen cleared?  No online courses or degrees displayed?  ",3
2986,"ok so i know that this is kind of a basic principle(order of operations), but many people including myself have never been EXACTLY sure on how to approah it.  In my highschool classes i was told to no matter what follow pemdas exactly how is spells out.  here it tells you to follow pemdas but is you come accross addition and subtraction in the same problem then go left to right, i never knew that part of it, and it also makes me wonder how i passed high school math as well. This link was really easy to use, and gave me a even better understand of the easy(or so i thought) order of opperations.",4
2987,"1.	Time  I went into this site several times for a total of more than an hour over the course of two days.  Each time I visited, more and more facets of the site impressed me.2.	Quality of Content.This is a terrific website.  As a writing teacher who is always looking for ways to improve and update my Composition courses, this is an invaluable resource.  It presents different aspects of the writing process (editing vs. revision) as well as many different writing styles (personal, argumentative, thesis).  It makes visible the fact that particular writing styles such as writing with a thesis, are not ?universal? and hence ?eternal? to writing instruction but an option, one of many types of writing.  It lists so many different aspects of a potential writing course in a visually appealing, lucid, basic manner.3.	Potential EffectivenessThis site contains immense potential for effectiveness.  There are dozens of potential writing assignments here and the pedagogical scaffolding around them, from simple response or descriptive writing to long complex documents.Technical Remarks: 4.	Ease of UseThe design is very user friendly.  Although one has to scroll a lot in the main frame, the left column has a convenient table of contents, making it very easy to navigate within each section. The color scheme is pleasant and calming.",5
2987,"I spent about an hour browsing the site, and found the material to be comprehensive and very good quality.  It is easy to navigate, with descriptive headings that allow one to jump to any section of interest.  Each section has interspersed expository text about the subject, summaries in the form of tables, and exercises.  Examples are used liberally, with good effect.  Besides the core educational material, there is a comprehensive list of reference books with links to amazon.com.  In consideration of these links, Amazon provides financial support for the site, which is a non-profit endeavor.The site also features a search engine, chat room, and discussion forum.  I did not try out the search engine nor the chat room.  There was nothing of profound interest to me in the forum.  The strength of the site is in its excellent tutorial content.  These other features are only icing on the cake.",4
2988,This lesson targets 3rd grade writers.  Students must spend time learning parts of speech.  This lesson gives students a chance to both review the parts of speech and apply the skill in a way that will keep them engaged.  Students are able to interact with each other in a variety of ways both in person and on a classroom blog.  The lesson is written in a clear and step by step manner for easy replication.Technical Remarks:Users must set up a classroom blog or similar way for students to record and comment on each others' sentences.  Users need a common spreadsheet or google docs page for students to complete the initial word sort.,5
2988,The lesson addressed the problem and was appropriate for the grade level.  The activity would increase interest and involvement.  The utilization of Google Docs is a great way to accumulate the words into their area.  The blog is a good evaluation tool for sentence structure results.  What if someone misclassifies a word? Will someone else help correct them?  Will the sentences be proof read before they are put on the blog or could this be another way to do active correction by others?  Good lesson.Technical Remarks:No problems accessing the lesson plan.,4
2989,This tutorial covers the basics of Pascal programming conveniently organized into separate topics with review exams after each module.  The text is easy to read with examples.  Downloads are included for educators to use in the classroom.,5
2990,"This one page is filled with a wide range of graphic organizers, or visual diagrams, that people understand concepts more quickly. The strength of this table is the variety of examples. Viewers can grasp the importance of visual literacy approachs by looking at it and they may get ideas to help them design their own diagrams or charts to help others understand the content they have to share.Technical Remarks:None.",4
2991,URL no longer functional,2

2994,Appears to be commercial promotion to police related products and services,1
2994,"The material was detailed and well presented.  It was easy to use and applicable for a Policing and Society, Ethics in Policing class etc.  I have used this in class several times.  Given the target audience some graphics would have gone a long way in keeping their attention.  Good stuff nonetheless.",4
2995,"This lesson does a great job getting students excited about learning the material. There are many different teaching strategies used in this lesson. I love that you use rollercoasters as an example, kids love them. This really helps make this concept connected to the real world.Technical Remarks:None",4
2995,"What a great lesson plan that relates to things students experience in the real world. I thought this lesson did a wonderful job incorporating different ways of presenting and interacting with the material such as video, demonstrations, group word, simulations, and all with the integration of technology. All cool ending to this unit or lesson could be a field trip to an amusement park to see these concepts in action.Technical Remarks:No issues.",4
2996,This article is a result of an exercise of using powerpoint presentations in teaching-learning.,4
2997,"Coaching individuals on their EI is a way to develop their awareness and motivation levels to bring about behaviour change. 
The beginning of the presentation is more informative about EI in general and its application to the workplace/career.
The latter half of the presentation is more of a 'sales pitch' on the company's software tools for EI assessment through 360 Feedback. The company also includes individual coaching services for the administration of the tools and interpretation of the feedback.",3
2998,"The lesson is appropriate for the early elementary audience you targeted.  Allowing the students to use manipulatives to represent the fact families, followed by drawings, followed by additional practice with the whiteboards gives them several different representations for addition and subtraction.  Given that this was for a second grade audience, students should be able to handle multiple representations during a single lesson.",5
2998,"This is a great lesson to review or learn basic addition and subtraction!  Many of my 3rd grade students would even benefit from this lesson.  It is important that students used manipulatives to actually see and touch what is being put together and what is being taken apart for each problem.  Also, it is beneficial that the students shared their thinking with their peers.  Sometimes something a student says while sharing can click with another student when it did not make sense beforehand. You also incorporated technology well by using the SmartBoard to model and share as well as online games to reinforce the concept.",5
2999,"Although dated, this is still a good source for information on methods to promote integrity in police departments. It will provide a source with which to begin and explore other materials and ideas.",4
3000,"The site has some links to journals that both faculty and students would find useful. The summaries of the journal focus would be helpful  for someone new to the field and unfamiliar with the variety of journals published in the field.  Technical Remarks: Although easy to use, the links do not all take the user to a journal.  Unfortunately many of the journals are unavailable on-line to the user who is not affiliated with San Diego State University and doesn't have a password or a subscription to Science Direct.  A few of the links do not appear to be in working order.",3
3001,"I spent about one hour reading the document hoping to help me make a decision on the correct design process to choose for a current project.  It was very interesting and educational.  It added a little something extra to my understanding of the design process by adding software development history.  I would have rated it a five, but the document is long and provides a lot of information to absorb at one time.  I don't know if the document would have made much sense to me without some knowledge of process models and the design process.  The important thing is that it did help me in choosing a process model.  I indicated not to be used in the classroom because the amount of information available is too much, but it makes an excellent resource.",4
3001,I reviewed the presentation/lecture.  It took my about hour to read it.  It contains a good overview of several process models.  ,4

3004,"The Digital Divide is an issue that is not just a problem in elementary, middle and high schools that can not afford the latest technology. I think it is also a huge issue in college and even in the workplace. I have personal seen students at a disadvantage because they could not afford their own computer, yet the classes they had required them to use a computer. They had access to one, yes but owning your own computer saves time that some students (and adults) just don't have. I think that it's important that we all read and understand the issues when it comes to the Digital Divide.",4
3005,What a great website! I really liked the multimedia feature. This would be a fun exploratory site for students to do on their own.,5
3006,"A common applet, but this one works very well.  Recommended.",4
3007,"Like the rest of the sites in the author's collection, this site is very  informative, clear, and uses nice graphics (some animated) to illustrate the  points.   Very extensive discussion.  For a nontechnical discussion, this site should be very helpful.",5
3008,"Excellent introductory material in Atmospheric Sciences, but not really a Remote Sensing site.  Can this be put into a Meteorology area and not a Remote Sensing one?  Technical Remarks: Excellent visuals and good layout.  ",4

3010,I spent approximately 15 minutes browsing this website.  The site provides basic information on a variety of subjects.  This site would probably be most beneficial to students.  The site was very easy to use,4
3010,"This site has so much information.  I spent just a short time there.  I will go back and consider viewing it more specifically.  It is very informative.  It helps a person to get insights into many family situations.  Mental illness, alcoholism, eating disorders just to name a few.Technical Remarks: Locating information was easy.

3010,"1. I spent hours reviewing all the material on this site. I simply printed out everything I could find and read all the information given. 2.The content I found to be very informative and accurate. I found it shocking at some aspects of how much parents actions and behaviors can actually be carried on through the children.3. if this site is used correctly anybody could find their way through it. It has multiple links to choose from, all of which are excellent. You can learn just about anything dealing with children problems, warning signs, etc...Technical Remarks: 4.First time users should have no problems getting through this site or finding it.",5
3010,"I reviewed the material over the course of an hour. The initial web site is a called Facts for Families. It's basically a list of links to issues concerning children and adolescents. During my hour I clicked on a good portion of the links. Some, to get the feel for this web site, but most because I was interested in the given topic. I would consider this web site to be of the utmost quality. Each link is clear, concise, and thorough. It is extremely user friendly and informative. The material is easy to understand and is not presented in an overwhelming manner for parents. It is non-threatening and unbiased - not the type of web site that will lead you to believe that your child has every issue imaginable. While it is an excellent resource for parents, it is also equally helpful to both students and teachers. Students can easily obtain great knowledge and the web site also tells you how to tactfully approach these topics. It explains what methods are effective, what are not. It stresses what aspects of an issue are the most important, and which should not be over analyzed. It also provides the reader with additional resources so they can obtain a well-rounded view and perhaps more in-depth information. ",5
3010,"1.  I spent about twenty minutes browsing through the many different topics on this site.  I found the site to be very factual and I felt that it provided a very wide range of topics.2.  The information provided was accurate and could be used for various purposes including: for research, for caregivers, for parents, for educational purposes, etc.3.  I think this information will enhance individuals learning and provide interesting topics that they were unaware of.4.  The material was very straightforward and easy to use.  First time users would have no problem finding this site.",5
3010,"This website was a great resource because it touched on many issues that can face teens today.

As the users go through the pages, they can notice the words applied in action. Each page is a clear example of what is said in the module of 508 Section. It also gives a clear example for the first steps in developing online materials. 
Furthermore, if in doubt, a developer can go to the overview page on Software Provisions and, by applying the five explained principles, improve a software/product according to the Section 508 guidelines. The site also follows the principles of simple and good methodology. It has clearly stated goals and objectives, introduction to subject, lectures with the look- and feel explanations (graphics to support the text), and assessment tools after each section/provision. The printable handouts are also available. The only flaw of this tutorial is that it doesn't have a high level of interactivity. After a while, it becomes dry and monotonous to follow the topic. But overall, it is a valuable, rich source for the implementation of Section 508.",5
3017,I spent a half hour to an hour working on the materials.  I felt that the quality of the content was significant.  The website can be a great tool to enhance your learning.

3017,"I went on to the website for about an hour and took a few tests to determine what certain aspects of my personality were, or to re-affirm them. I think that the tests were thorough and very detailed, which made it very helpful. This would definently be educationally effective, and would help students and teachers to be aware of themselves. It was a very well done website, and everything was listed, and detailed with pictures.Technical Remarks: It would be quite easy for a person to navigate themselves around this site, since it is easily titeled",4

3021,I spent about a half of an hour going over this site. I actually enjoyed the other activities on the site more so than the sliding 8 puzzle it self. I thought these were very interesting games and they accurately present concepts that are relevant to mathematics and problem solving. I feel that these puzzle could be very usefull for a problem sovling class or for a lower leval math class were the teachers are trying to get their students interested in the world of math and problem solving.

I really do believe my students will benefit from this site.  There are some fun interactive activities here and I believe that will definitely keep their attention and help them acquire a higher level of understanding with this complex material.

3025,"This site has an interesting biography of Piaget. It also has a lot of relevant links, but overall doesn't really add to a students knowledge of cognitive development.Technical Remarks: I spent only a little while going through this site as there wasn't that much to read.

I spent probably 15 minutes reviewing the material that i found interesting.  The material accurately presents concepts educationally.  It gave alot of explanation of his life, and what he did.Technical Remarks: If you're interested in this type of material, i think it is very effective for learning.

3029,"I spent about an hour reviewing the materials on this site.  There is a wonderful collection of essays and articles on all aspects of eating disorders.  The essays on cultural issues that affect the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders were very well written and very informative.  In addition to providing solid information, this site also hosted chats and discussion lines for those in recovery.I think that this site would be a good, down to earth introductory site for those interested in learning more about eating disorders.Technical Remarks: This site was very well laid out with a nice side bar navigational system.  The coloring however made it difficult to read some of the options.",4

3030,"This is a very intersting topic and a really good presentation. The front page is engaging and the tool bar easily accessible. It is easy to navigate through the presentation and directions are easy to follow. I believe the students will enjoy this StAIR and will engage easily. The combination of photos, videos, interactive quiz questions, and timeline provide several methods of presenting the material in a manner that will reach various types of learners.Technical Remarks:Overall, this is a very good StAIR. I was not able to play the embedded video, some of the answers and answer buttons were out of alignment on a few of the quiz pages, and there were a few minor spelling issues. However, these are minor issues and easy to fix. I enjoyed this StAIR and would use it in my classroom.",4
3030,"I really enjoyed the background of the presentation and other visuals such as pictures of people, the timeline, and videos. There was one video that did not play for me. I interactive quiz had great information and it was helpful if an answer was incorrect a clue was given to help find the correct one.Technical Remarks:The main menu was very organized since you could choose timeline, people, quiz or origin. Check to see if all the videos work since I had difficulty with one on playing.",4

3032,"Jennifer, you truly did a wonderful job in creating this StAIR.  As an English major, I had to pay close attention to what I was doing in order to complete this StAIR, but, as your students will, I managed to succeed!You utilize many UDL principals within this project.  You cater to all types of learners by making sure every slide has text, visual images, and audio.  There is something there for every student.  Also, your use of arrows and directions make your StAIR easy to follow.  An instructional strategy I thought was useful was that you did not feed the students too much information before quizzing them.  As a non-science person, I needed to be quizzed right away in order to believe I truly understood what I was doing.  Very nice job there.One note of constructive criticism: I found some of your slides overwhelming because of the amount of text on them.  Specifically, the opening 5 or so slides, which were full of text related to the metals.  Maybe for a couple of these slides you could require students to listen to the audio, while you include bulleted points on the slide.Technical Remarks:Your product works flawlessly in kiosk mode. There are no technical glitches that I have found.",4
3032,"Generally speaking, this ppt is very good and professional. And also it is interesting and attractive to me, although I don't understand chemistry so clear, but still wants to have this class, since it is fun.I generalize the good points as below:1. UDL   I find Jenni provides multiple means of action and expressions.   a. provide varied ways to respond     In the quiz part, if you goes to a correct answer, she will explain further, but if you go to a wrong answer, she will still gives more explanations.    I also find she uses multiple means of engagement.    a. increase individual choice and autonomy      students could goes to the part they want on the homepage, and it saves a lot of trouble to get trapped. 2. Instructional StrategiesI think Jennie uses at least 3 strategies:    a. differentiate : she differentiate the two kinds of chemical materials in picutres, definitions and quizzes.    b. identify: she makes the reader to identify each chemical features in words , in multiple chocies and pictures.    c. deduce: when I read this ppt, I learn how to deduce accroding to her explanations.  Technical Remarks:This material has an excellent technology.The direction is very clearn and I am guided smoothly to all the ppt without any trouble.",5

3041,I spent about a half an hour looking around this site. I have never heard of synesthesia before.  I think I would go crazy if I had to live with a condition like this.  This site is interesting though.  In a way I question whether I believe that there really is a condition like this.  Technical Remarks: It is really easy to find your way around this site.  ,3
3041,"This site I had read through for about an hour or so.  I found the actual personal stories very interesting.  I feel the quality of this site was very clear, and to the point.  I feel if anyone that did not know about synesthesia they will learn very much about it from this.  This material is very easy to obtain, and reach a level of understanding.  Technical Remarks: I felt this site had no problems of difficulty getting into the web site.  I think the technicality of the site could be of a child.  This site is very straight forward, and interesting.  ",4
3041,"Site has no pedagogical merit because it provides no references. This omission is crucial because the condition does not appear to have any scientific merit.   The obvious question of measurement (how does anyone concvince someone else they have the condition?) is never even discussed.  Overall, I am highly skeptical that such a condition exists.  Statements such as ""I love the colours of my first name, they're quite fun"" do not give me any confidence in the validity of the material.",1

3043,"This presentation is particularly troublesome for anyone who teaches principles of accounting. Transactions are first recorded in a journal and then posted to the ledger. This presentation skips the recording in the journal step in the accounting cycle and posts directly to the ledger represented by t-accounts. In addition, several transactions are processed incorrectly. All income statement accounts are ignored with no explanation.   All transactions that involve revenue and expense accounts are directly debited or credited to the owner's capital account. In addition the Supplies account is really an Art Supplies Merchandise Inventory account.  Generally, the supplies account implies office supplies. Given this exercise sell merchandise, a discussion as to which inventory system is being used is relevant to how the transaction is handled. As a result the presentaion can be quite misleading.  However, the use of the Excel spreadsheet to illustrate the posting process and how the information flows to the trial balance and balance sheet is very nice.  It could be used as a model for others to emulate, but with accurate information included instead.",2

3046,"I completely agree with the statement made in this lesson plan that faculty and administration should become aware of how well social networking tools and technology can work in a classroom. There is data which we have seen that supports this idea and somehow should make it clearer for it to become part of the curriculum in any learning content. This lesson plan does an excellent job at achieving the goal of promoting the use of technology in the classroom, more specifically Twitter. There are a couple of things that I enjoy the most about this lesson plan. First, I like the idea of working collaborately, both students and teachers. Under, the UDL Guidelines, this promote socialization and can stablish a better learning environment. This strategy is also a good way to model for your students since eventually the goal is for them to participate and becoming ""Followers"" on twitter. Second, the objectives are clearly met by the end of the lesson plan. The main objective being to have all involved parties gaining quality knowledge about twitting and eventually used to improve the student's learning experiences. Third, I feel that this lesson plan does a great job at having teachers reflect on their own knowledge of technology. It gives them a chance to improve on it and use to improve their own teaching methods. Overall this is a wonderful lesson plan that can be used for any content or curriculum. Once it is put into practice with students it will be a successful experience.  Technical Remarks:The lesson plan was on a PDF format. No links or any other technoligical materials were associated with it",4
3046,"This is a great Lesson plan to get teachers exposed and experienced in using one of the most ubiqitous social networking tools of our age: Twitter.  Good scaffolding is provided for those teachers who are not comfortable using the tool through an initial group approach, encouraging teachers to discover the basics of the tool together.  As they get more comfortable, the focus shifts towards more individual work.The focus on building community around tech tools is laudible and should go well given that the author is an administrator.A suggestions for improvement could be to include a rubric that clearly indicates what constitutes success.  Possible inclusions could be number of tweets sent, number of twitter friends followed and so on.Another possibility would be to target a specific conference of interest and have teachers follow the hashtag to create exposure to this method of Professional Learning. Technical Remarks:The lesson plan opens well.  It is a PDF file without external links.",5

3048,"This lesson is designed to help high school band students learn how to play the correct style that a march demands. I like that this lesson employs a variety of teaching strategies. Through modeling, this lesson creates awareness of appropriate articulation. This lesson also builds the sense of teamwork through viewing videos about articulation and recording and listening to rehearsals and thus teaches students how to be independent learners. Technical Remarks:Lesson plan is in Google Drive.",4
3048,"This Goal Directed Instructional Design Plan was easy to follow. The information provided was specific enough not to loose the user. I like the information on under “a real world performance”, but It would be nice if the learner had links to real world performances or a video under that heading. I also like the information under “a set of essential content” because it allows learner to be aware of what they need to know in order to proceed with the StAIR. I believe that the section “a method to help participants learn” could be more open to the individual students as they record their sounds and have their classmates listen to them and provide feedback. This sections also lends it self to multiple methods of face 2 face instruction, like Power Point, Voicesthread, and Wikis. Lastly, the socialization aspect of this StAIR seems lacking socialization. The students could play for each other, they could recorded it for others, they could work in groups as they collaborate with each other to improve their individual sound, etc.  Overall, I beleive that this is a ok resource that students can use.Technical Remarks:The technological needs fits the requirements of the StAIR. It would be nice to see students using other online sound base programs that other students could coment on like soundcloud. ",3
3048,"This lesson outlines the basics for teaching band students about the particular style of marches. I appreciate that during the course of the lesson there are a variety of methods used to get the content to the student.

The section on entropy is the most incredible mess of garbage, misinformation, and error that I have ever seen in 70 years!  I can't imagine that such antique/obsolete/unscientific trash would be used in the US -- or cited in Merlot.

The ONLY modern treatment of entropy is that which is written by Stephen Lower -- and cited here.Technical Remarks:NO chemistry text in the US has ANY such trash -- ""entropy as a quantity of heat""!!

However, as I checked the other links on the page I found that there was decent information on phobias. I would not consider this to be a high quality site, however. The references are well noted. I think that the site would offer some learning, maybe as a beginning to phobias and the different phobias listed. The author does tell you in the beginning that some of the phobias are named by people that have no significant background to do so. There are also phobias that are listed several times with the only exception being the name of the phobia. To me this site shows that there is a significant need to get control over who names a phobia and put an end to multiple names of the same phobias.Perhaps the biggest plus from an educational stand point would be that there is an entire list of phobias in one place versus having to find them separately. Technical Remarks: First time users would find it easy to browse and there are no medical terminology that the average person wouldn't understand.",4

The questions created for each of the math scenes in The Simpsons are thought provoking and allow students to think critically about a topic. The questions posed 3D vs. 2D I believe will intrigue students and is something that is visually seen in the episode. Also, showing students how pi is incorporated into The Simpsons and then following up with the questions that are given on the site can engage students in a topic that might usually be bland.Technical Remarks:I only find problems with finding the exact Simpsons episode that incorporates the math.

I believe the survey beforehand is a great tool to get attendees thinking about the upcoming workshop and great information for you to have to help tailor to your audience in a very specific manner. I think a follow up survey at the end to see what attitudes and ideas changed for the attendees after the workshop might be helpful. Having a type of summary of items learned/discussed as a “take away” for each attendee is great for them as reference tool later. ,4

A brief review of the pictures revealed lots of excellent images. But searches on certain combinations (Africa, 1996) revealed too few pictures to make this database a reliable source of images from different spaces, cultures, and times. Like most sites that promise a world of content in its search options, it offers only what it currently has. (If the U.S. were to rejoin UNESCO, I wonder if the added funding would help with photo acquisitions.)Potential EffectivenessI could see this photobank being useful for illustrating various lecture and discussion topics (e.g., cultural change, modernization, globalization). If, for instance, I needed images of the Altamira caves, I could do a specific search for them. I suppose I could do this on Google images, too, but I?m more likely to get better quality images here.Ease of UseThe site offers a French language option for Francophones; it also an English version for us Francophobes.

Knowing how to organize, plan, and compose expository writng is a very useful skill that can be applied to real-world performance.  The author applies UDL principles which discusses potential barriers and how they can be over-come which is very helpful for educators to use in their own classrooms.  Students will be motivated to do this activity through the use of common activites that are familiar to them and the opportunity to share their completed project with peers.  This is a well organized lesson plan that upper elementary teachers could use in their classrooms Technical Remarks:Students must have access to computers, Web 2.0, and Voicethread.",4

As a second time user of this site I find it easy to find resources. ,4
3092,"This is a brief overview of the subject matter and is valuable as such.  Anyone seeking in depth knowledge would be advised to use this as a starting point.  Does contain a link to the American Psychological Association website which is very imformative.Technical Remarks: Very easy to use, easy to link to APA website.",3
3092,This site is very informative on the effects of violent TV shows on children.  The site explains how continuous exposure to violence leads to an insensitivity to violence in children.  I found this site to be an eye opener for parents.,4
3092,"This link takes you to an article on violence on TV, a subtopic of the American Psychological Association. The web page on violence on TV is short and succinct. It took about 5 minutes to read through, but provided useful information. The information on the page seemed very accurate, and provided examples of studies on this topic. This site also provided information for parents and what they can do about violence on TV. The major fault was the information did not seem current. The ?for more information? section?s most recent publication was from 1991. I feel that there has been much recent information on this topic that would prove beneficial.As stated earlier this site was part of the APA site. The tool bar contains a link for a site map, which takes you tall all of APA?s resources, including topics on AIDS, aging, disabilities, kids, and women. It even has a link to find your own psychologist (even though you would have to call). The sites seem full of up to date information and provide an excellent learning experience. I particularly like the public information section, which included the Violence on TV article, as well as information on ways to control anger, depression, and many others. I recommend everyone to check out this site because of its vast amount of information and its ease to use.",4
3092,"In reviewing the materials, I spent as much time as I felt it was necessary to gain a firm understanding of the content. I feel that this topic is a very controversial subject, but one that needs immediate addressing. After reading the specific area on the aggressive behavior that teens portrayed after viewing violent programs I came away with the understanding that this is a serious problem. How are we as a society going to fix it? Parents need to be well educated and informed in regard to how television viewing effects their children both emotionally and psychologically. This web-site was extremly worthwhile in presenting us with an outline of our ever changing society towards violent behaviors. Is it fair to blame the children that don't have controls over what they are watching? Should parents be playing more of a role in monitoring what their children view?

3092,I spent about two hours reviewing materials. The content was good. This could help to teach children. Technical Remarks: Sometimes the website would freeze. Other than that it was fine,4
3092,I spent a long time in reviewing this site. I read the whole site and logged on to other areas within the site which may answer questions for other issues. I felt that the content was excellent and effective for teaching. This subject is a major problem with todays children and many parents do not even realize this. Technical Remarks: This was the one area I had problems with. It took three applications to Merlot to get a password to work. Once I finally got it straightened out with you it worked very well. I would reccommend this to any students for any subject available that they need.,4
3093,Wave is now at version 4.0.  Features are much more user friendly and explanations are much easier to understand.,4
3093,"So simple to use. I wouldn't depend on it exclusively, but it flags images without ALT tags, forms without correct labels and all those kinds of things. Check it out.",5
3093,"Wave 3.0 is a Web Accessibility tool.  It provides feedback on Web pages regarding several features-- all with the aim of maximizing the accessibility of Web pages to people with all levels of ability -- visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive.To get the most out of WAVE, Students should be able to develop Web sites and  have good understanding of HTML, usability and accessibility.  WAVE uses color-coded icons to provides feedback about structure, content, usability, as well as  accessibility issues.  There is a page of clear instructions explaining the icons. I teach Web development courses and have been trying out the tool.  It is easy to use and feedback is easy to understand.  I have been using Bobby, another accessibility tool, with my students.  Students have difficulty interpreting the results.  WAVE's results appear to be much easier to understand, as well as broader in scope.Technical Remarks: No special software is needed.  It is well-designed.  The instructions are simple and the interface is clear. Both local and uploaded Web pages can be submitted for evaluation.  I had no problems with either method.Two other methods are available that make submission a click away -- a WAVE toolbar and a WAVE bookmarklet.  I have not used them yet.",5
3094,"I spent about 10 minutes browsing through several of the links.  The one I spent the most time on was ""Evaluating Websites.""  I feel that is information will be useful to students as they search and research a topic.  They will know how to check for accuracy and authenticity so as not to waste too much time on inappropriate information.  As an instructor I can check out sites before I recommend them to students.  This will save everyone time and improve learning by not dwelling on incorrect information. Technical Remarks: I found the site easy to navigate (particularly since I am not a complete techy).  I found many things I will try in my own course development.  ",4
3094,Spent 10 minutes browsing. The content does provide a great deal of information for anyone researching design resources. The user of this site has a great deal of information available for learning. The site is extremely easy to use.,4
3095,"I have been using WebCape as a placement as well as an assessment tool in Intermediate French for the past two years. The students take it during the first week of the semester (the minimum to enroll in 2nd year is 300) then at the end of the semester before the final exam. In many cases the test will show a difference of as much as 60-75 points for a 5 hour/week semester course. In students who take less than 5 hours of French per week, the score will increase by 30-60.  Students take the test in the language lab and have their scores sent to them and to me by email or they bring a printed copy of their results to me. They take it when they return after winter or summer break even if they have taken it at the end of the previous semester because there is usually a slight difference after the students have not been exposed to the language for several weeks. WebCape appears to be an excellent assessment tool, not only for the students themselves who can keep track of their progress, but for instructors as well who can use it to evaluate their teaching effectiveness.I have seen a few puzzling cases in which the scores did not at all reflect a student's proficiency either by being too low or too high. But these are exceptions and in general I find that the test gives a quantitative equivalent of what an oral proficiency interview would tell me about a student's level.",4
3096,Most of the sites listed are free to use. Excellent source of information mainly for the instructor that has and maintains a website      of their own.,4
3097,"I really like the concepts of your lesson plan.  I like how the students have to take into consideration different readings and ideas to form their opinion.  Opinion/Argument writing is a huge part of the Common Core State Standards and I think this lesson does a great job supporting that.  I think a way you could extend this lesson plan is to give them a scenario, maybe in groups, and have them decide what they should do to take action/form an opion about the scenario.You might also want to insert a link to your Edmodo page so that it can be easily accessed and people can get an example of what you are using in your class.",4
3097,"I like the concept of this plan, of building in some democratic community building within the consideration of democratic principles.Your lesson plan is marked up with highlighting which I know is based on applying UDL principles to it.  It is a little distracting to have these highlighted sections, but since you do I’d like to address some of the areas you have highlighted as barriers.  I believe you are concerned with the textual nature of both the input and performance tasks.  Perhaps you could add an audio version of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and have some students use vlogs rather than blogs.  Using something like VoiceThread might work well for this as well.A suggestion I have for taking this to the next step and using the online community for an actual task is to ask the students to come up, as a group analogous to a legislative body, with their own declaration on human rights or a statement on some particular human rights issue that they may encounter.Technical Remarks:It might be helpful to have a link to Edmodo and other similar sites that could accommodate a lesson like this.",4
3098,"15 minutes, good content.  Good question answer discussion of what the benefits and reasons for 64-bit processors are good for.  ",4
3098,"This article takes about 10 minutes to read, and while it was published in 1995, the material is still relevant.  It goes into detail on how 64-bit is used in arthimetic, registers, and how it all ""fits together"".

3101,"The site is excellent in it's use of screen shots to show exactly how different parts of the XP operating system work. The site gives a good alternative to the Microsoft description of the operating system, with flaws and idiosyncracies identified.Technical Remarks: A user must register in order to see some of the screen shots, or the entire site can be downloaded. The site itself loads quickly and runs smoothly.",4
3102,"Nice graphics, with an applet that is clear and easy to use.  I am not sure which teachers would be interested in this, but the applet certainly works well.",4
3103,"The Saylor textbook is a good stand in for my online general education World History courses.  It offers a ten unit  introduction of World History with thematic and chronological order from the Exchanges-1700- to Modernity.  The ten unit thematization is then segmented into subsequent sections which would work well with 8-16 week courses. Some ancillaries include a free self enroll w/certificate, powerpoints, (where the images are located), and quizzes.  Not all the units/chapters have active links to assessments or quizzes.   The creative commons license is CC 3.0 but changes with attributes from other institutions. 
The reading portion is segmented or chunked but difficult to ascertain what is important, i.e., no headings or call outs, though there are focus outlines offered in the beginning sections.  
The online text has suggested readings and links, however, the sections within the chapters are not easily identifiable.  There is a noticeable lack of vocabulary and key words.  Another challenge is when students will need to cite a specific page or section, as it is not easily found.  
When reviewing this book, I used a Macbook Chrome and noticed no accessibility issues, though not all links function within the textbook.
As an immediate transitional book to OER, I recommend it for college courses with instructors who are able to modify and/or supplement learning material as needed.",3
3104,"Very well organized plan.  Being that I've been one who seems to have problem doing an outline 'correctly', I found this plan to be very helpful.  It's really concise when explaining how the class will proceed.  The minimal knowledge of the use of technology would be very beneficial for those who may not have been confronted with writing an outline.",4
3104,This lesson plan seeks to better prepare students for writing research papers by breaking the process into specific tasks and helping them develop a more clear beginning-middle-end narrative experience to the process.  Utilizing video technology and encouraging students to interact gives the lesson an entertaining quality which will engage learners.   ,5
3104,"The focus of this lesson is to teach students, middle school-high-school level how to write an outline for a research paper. This goal is clearly stated under the problem/need identification area. This lesson presents the content information to the students in various ways such as examples, cooperative learning, and online connections. The lesson is well planned out; it was easy to follow and was clear enough anybody could teach it. Technical Remarks:No technical problems to report",4
3105,I really like the different writing strategies highlighted here.,5
3106,Yoga as an alternative theory method for treatment of depression and sleep disorders is an entertaining idea that I would support before treatment with medicine. ,3
3106,Interesting read. I hope they will actually keep this experiment going with possibily increasing trial size and having a control. The results look promising and provide another possibility in reducing major psychiatric disorders.,4
3106,"Insightful.  Ultimately nonconclusive at this point due to the lack of scientific rigor, but an interesting realm of future study especially as more funding is directed toward mental wellness in the light of recent events.",3

Students were rewarded based on who made the most profit in a month. Students were able to complete at least one full month of sales in an hour.Technical Remarks:The site is borked. You can sell cups with no lemons, ice or sugar. Students soon figured that you could cheat the game and they did.",3
3113,I spent about 45 minutes at this site.  I found this a great concept and very rewarding.  It is amazing what is being done for our fellow living creatures and I hope it catches on quickly.Technical Remarks: Easy site to navigate.,5
3113,"I think the whole concept of this site is amazing!  The information that is found within this site is very intersting.  I spent about 30 minutes reading through this site.  I think it provides valuable information about chimpanzees and communication between animals and humans.

3113,the site is well organized and provides interesting reading about the Chimpanzee who is closest to humans in DNA.  Washoe is an interessting subject .  She exemplifies the fact that there is a higher level of consciousness in the Chimp than was ever imagined and this is made clear through her communication using American Sign Language.  Washoe can express feelings and emotions and uncerstanding that most individuals never realized existed in a chimanzee.  We have much to learn from this researchTechnical Remarks: the site could be much more animated and show more pictures of the Chimps throughout the story as written by the author.,4
3113,"I spent around 40 minutes reading the information in this site. I was unaware that things as this occured, so I was quite fascinated by it. I learned a great deal, and I feel other students interested in this topic, would also be enlightened. The information is presented in describing a families life with chimp's. Technical Remarks: I found this site easy to brouse. The informative headings let you see the different topics so you just point and click where you want to brouse. On this day, all of the links were up and working.",5
3113,I spent about 1 hour reviewing the site and reading the story of Washoe. The quality of the content was very good and also very interesting. I think that this site could be very helpful in learning especially in experimental research. This is a site the whole family can enjoy.Technical Remarks:  It was very easy to navigate the site and even first time users should find it easy to get around.,4
3113,"I reviewed the materials for about an hour or so.  I read through all of the information, and was very interested in proceeding with it.  I believe the quality of the content was excellent.  I believe this site has a very high potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning.  I believe students that are going into a field with psychology with children will find this influential.

3118,"Site Pal animated characters hold a lot of promise for computer mediated English language learners. The site allows individuals to create animated characters that speak. This entails creating appearances, choosing clothing and so on. When reviewing the site, my first impulse was to have the language learners create the animated characters and create the text that the animated characters will speak. Once created, they can share their characters with their classmates. I think that activities that include these animated characters hold a lot of promise for students to practice productive skills and for raising awareness of pronunciation.Technical Remarks:The user interface seems easy to understand and use. The animated characters will interface with 95% of web browsers. Pronunciation is clear but most characters seem to speak with a slight lisp.",4
3118,"This is an excellent website allows the language teachers to create speaking and listening activities, which motivate students. Also, the students can create their own characters and record their own voice, which will give them a chance to listen and evaluate their own speaking.

http://www.oddcast.com/sitepal/

I liked this website very much because it allows its users to design speaking animated characters in minutes. I think it is very useful for teachers to create animated characters and let them talk to students. Based on my experience, students love cartoons and animated characters and they almost learn by heart whatever those characters say. Teachers should take this opportunity and make the animated character say what they want their students to learn. By doing this, the teachers would help their students learn easily and with a great amount of fun.

This feature can be used for teaching grammatical rules. Also it can be used for telling stories, after which the teacher could ask the students to summarize or translate. In addition to this it can be used for giving instructions or directions. Students themselves can use it in recording whatever they want.Technical Remarks:The website is very easy-to-use. It has been provided with very clear, step by step instructions to help you create and edit animated characters and record sounds. The number of the available options to create different characters with different shapes and ages is just amazing. This service is not free. Users have to pay. There are three different packages to suit different budgets and needs. The more you pay the better service you will get.",4
3119,I have linked my students in both critical thinking and introductory philosophy courses to this site as a way for them to have extra practice in logic and fallacies.  I especially appreciate the sections on fallacies as nearly every student I have needs more practice in identifying fallacies in arguments.  I and my students have found the site easy to navigate and access and find that the comments that show up for incorrect answers are helpful for students to identify why they got a partular question incorrect.  I'll be reccomending that my adjuncts who are teaching logic and critical thinking also make use of this site.Technical Remarks:The site is easy to navigate and access.  A few students have commented that they found the yellow/green color combination of the site a little bothersome.,4
3119,"Introducing the basic concepts of critical thinking to undergraduate students can be a trying experience. The level of abstract reasoning is sometimes presented in a way that actually hinders student learning. The organization of the concepts and materials in this tutorial should help students identify, learn, and use the tools of critical reasoning. The tutorial introduces basic concepts in an easily understandable language without invoking too many of the formal, technical terms in a way that will confuse students as to their meanings and usage.There were a handful of misspellings that need to be cleaned up.This site and tutorial would be a worthwhile addition to a course on critical thinking or an introduction to logic and reasoning.Technical Remarks:The site is easily navigable and provides an easy means for students to review materials at their convenience. Although the site is fairly simple, that is a positive aspect. The technology does not interfere with the learning process. The page that lists external sources was also fairly good, although there are some additional websites and pages that could be added. The list needs to be updated on a regular basis in order to stay current.",4

3119,Materials accurately presented...this is a very helpful tool to use for assessment of student knowledge of subject matter. The Links to other resources is helpful. Technical Remarks: Very easy to use-no problems at all. ,4
3119,"It?s not easy to develop tutorials in logic and critical thinking, and the author of this site (Jay VerLinden) acknowledges those difficulties in a ?Limitations? page. He explains that the site is not a ?substitute for a good text,? may not adequately correlate concepts that are tested with the concepts in a particular textbook, may present concepts by names that are different from those with which students are familiar, and that the tutorials are ?not meant to help you directly improve your higher order critical thinking and argumentative skills.?Given the author?s stated limitations, the site contains a great deal of terminology review information that is readily accessible to students. Exposure to concepts or names beyond the scope of their coursework may be somewhat confusing, but it may also afford students an opportunity to make connections to a broader range of language used in argumentation.Technical Remarks: The site is arranged simply and all pages have clear navigation links. Pages load quickly because they do not contain graphics. The ?Links to Other Resources? page provides a categorized list of linked resources, only one of which was a dead end. However, there were quite a few links to paranormal sites, and it wasn?t clear how these were expected to fit in with the others.",4
3119,"I spent about a half hour clicking on several of the test areas, including ones on formal logic and infomal fallacies. The test questions range from true/false to ""short answer""; for the latter the student is asked to think of the answer before clicking to see the correct answer. True/false questions give the correct answer when either true or false is clicked. For multiple choice questions students are not told what the correct answer is until it is clicked. The questions and answers are quite straightforward and reinforce basic logical concepts, such as validity, induction, deduction, and the like. The reason I selected three stars is for a reason recognized by the author, who states on a page giving the limitations of the tutorial that many of the subjects covered in the multitude of tests (dozens and dozens) may not be covered in the student's text but, more importantly, subjects that are covered may not have the same name as that given in the tutorial. In order for a given instructor to adapt the materials a large effort would be requried to rewrite the questions. Some of the questions would fit any logic or critical thinking text, but others, with different names, might well be confusing for students. The content is certainly the core curriculum within an introduction to logic or critical thinking course and the tutorial may be helpful as a teaching tool, emphasizing repetition as the author notes. The tutorial would work best, it seems to me, after the basic concepts have been learned and the instructor is looking for ways to reinforce learned concepts. Answer pages provide positive and immediate feedback to students.Technical Remarks: The various pages are text only, without illustrations, so they load rapidly even with a slow modem connection. The page for questions and answers might be made more elegant but the questions and answers are easy to read on the screen. Each page provides a link back to the test selection area so the student would not get ""trapped"" by the software. There is no tracking of answers. ",3

3129,"Circumventricular Organs (System) have been well studied, starting with Paul Ehrlich work with Trypan Blue in 1882, and research on their functions is still going on. However, Neuroscience medical students find it difficult to understand them. This short PPTX is meant to succinctly explain the Circumventricular Organs.
Short Video clips pertaining to each CV Organ on a human brain specimen, created and uploaded on YouTube by the author, Dr Sanjoy Sanyal, Professor and Course Director of Neuroscience, are embedded between slides, to provide a narrative highlight to what is mentioned in the slides.

3130,This lesson is a excellent way to teach several physics concepts to students. The lesson brings an exciting real-life example (roller costers) to engage the students in learning the phyics behind the fun. There is an excellent use of technology in the lesson with both iPads and Podcasting being tools used to help student learning. These tools really make this lesson accessible to students of all levels and help stimulate all learning types that may be engaged. Some scaffolding may need to be done in order to ensure students get the most out of the technoloy. This lesson does a great job creating meaning for the students and allows them to interact with peers in problem-solving.,5
3130,This seems like a very engaging project!  I like how the plan is mapped out day by day.  The use of technology in this project is strong and allows the students to experience an aspect of science they would not be able to recreate in the classroom otherwise. It would be nice to know what role the teacher has in providing evaluative material.  There is a lot of collaboration among students but what about descriptive feedback from the teacher to the students?  Overall a very solid lesson and one I'd love to do myself if I had access to iPads and taught 9th graders.Technical Remarks:PDF functioned perfectly.  Lesson seems to be technically sound provided you have access to the proper technological equipment.,5

3147,"Special Education Teachers are always looking for ways to teach appropriate social and interpersonal skills to moderately cognitively impaired individuals.  Older students also need to learn good job interviewing skills.  I found this checklist with the associated systematic instruction plan extremely effective with most of the students I used it with.  We role-played the job interview setting and I also had students role-play among themselves, taking turns as interviewer and interviewee.  I was able to use the checklist to determine the individual student's strengths and weaknesses and then could concentrate on the skills needing the most practice.  For ""homework"" I had students practice introducing themselves to a friend or a family member or just simply use a mirror.  For this I had each student write a short ""JIST"" card that basically introduced themselves and would be something they could easily remorize. I plotted the students' scaled observation scores as baseline and then as probes over time from the checklist on a student progress chart.  We had a lot of fun with the activity and the students learned about personal space, eye contact, smiling, and good posture/body language.  They also learned how to talk about themselves in a constructive fashion.",5
3148,"Though I have not used this particular material written and upgraded to present an Introduction to Black Studies, Dr. Alkalimut's research and consistent historical methodology presents to readers an excellent study tool based on resources which are dependable and accountable. The material presented contains data which is verifiable and withstands the tests of historians who contemplate rewriting the history of the American experience of enslaved Africans.  This is a concise presentation of a displaced people and their journey in a land where dreams became nightmare and were deferred as a collective group unlike others who arrived on vessels based on voluntary circumstance.  No group in American history have had the identical experience which has resulted in stolen identity, stolen culture, and after wars remain collective bound by invisible barriers which has hinder the collective body from achieving.  Alkalimut meticulously outlines the development of Black culture in America from 1619 to the present.  His points are relevant, making the observations necessary which pinpoint the areas which paint a most powerful, prolific picture of the making of a Nation within a Nation.  His words characterizes and challenges the political and historical pundits which dare to manipulate the truth of the American experience and would on every turn make the journey less than the reality it was.  For example, though 14 years in the making, this work is a response to the revisionist thoughts of those who seek to place America and the Christian faith in a more favorable light than the reality of the times. The writing serves as an excellent starting point for serious students of the uniqueness of the Black Experience in America.  It responds well to questions such as, why is American slavery considered worst then slavery in Africa or other countries?  It even answers the question to those who would place slavery today on the same level as the Atlantic slave experience.  Each chapter explores and uncovers information which has been displaced, carefully sharing the thoughts of individuals who have carefully analyzed the various historical movements which demonstrated the growth of enslaved Africans from their arrival to present day inclusive of major movements referenced in Moynihan's study, A National Call to Action: The Negro Family. This report has been used by White and Black intellectuals to describe the weakness of the Black Family, describing the Black Family as being a deficit due to the number of female head of household.  However, though Moynihan warned of the questionability of his data sets, those interpreting his report have missed the obvious concerns Moynihan was attempting to portray, namely, the impact of racism, the impact of the failure of White America and intellectual Blacks who did account for factors.  Two major points observed by Moynihan was the difference of interpreting terminology between Blacks and Whites, e.g., understanding liberty and freedom.  This focuses on the hermeneutical initiative being used by the scholar and world view.  An excellent teaching tool which would be strengthen with lesson tools added.",4

It shows the procedure for Lumbar Puncture on the new, digital Gaumard(R) LP Trainer, which is an improved version over the older mannikin used in 2011.
This video shows the actual process of LP on the Gaumard(R) LP Trainer, from the site of needle puncture, to the layers piereced, culminating the the distinct 'pop' sensation that characterizes entry of the Tuohy needle tip into the Lumbar Cistern.
The usual site is between L3-L4 spinous process, However, later students wanted me to do the same in the L2-L3 interspinous space, which is demonstrated in the last part of this video.
Education value: It shows the exact steps of the Lumbar Puncture procedure that is supposed to be employed in real life, for medical students and residents and health professionals in training.
It is a follow up of a previous video that showed only the slides of LP procedure on the Gaumard(R) LP trainer.

3187,"I found Merlot extremely confusing for some reason. I rarely used it, and instead searched on my own. Probably ending up on a site that is in Merlot.
The few times I was able to figure it out and get in there I found it would not really bring me to the search area I wanted or needed very efficiently. I understand that this is an award winning site, and that the fault probably lies in my ignorance in its use.
I will continue to keep using Merlot for at least the rest of my collegiate career, and I will probably become better adapted to it as a result. I think the idea of this site is extraordinary though.Technical Remarks:As I said, there is a reason I did not include this in my Webliography report.

As the web grows so do the contents, but not necessarily the best and most appropriate resources.  Search engines are good for the initial inquiry, but are lengthy and difficult to weed through.  Thenks to MERLOT, I found ""Link Mail"" and the search for quality links and information was done for me.

The information is all relevant and current for my intended audience and is presented in an orderly and appropriate sequence for taking technical writers through the process of creating a written report.

I intend to use these general materials in concert with in-class writing assignments that the students will produce (either bring to class already-existing samples or work on an upcoming report).

3240,"Content Quality - The simulation is a clear demonstration of the refraction of light through a prism.  The light source can be either a single frequency beam or a white beam of light.  The white beam can be used to easily show dispersion.  The light source and the prism can be moved and rotated.  The index of refraction and the width of the prism can also be adjusted to explore their effect on dispersion or refraction in general.  The background grid can be turned on and off and a protractor tool can be used to measure the angles of incidence and refraction.  
Potential Effectiveness - The simulation can be used to introduce dispersion.  The measuring tools allow for a more in depth exploration of the Snell's law,  the critical angle and total internal reflection.  The parent website, ExploreLearning provides worksheets and lesson plans for the simulation.
Ease of Use - The simulation is made in Gismos that runs on PCs, Macs, iPads, Chromebooks, and Android devices.  The simulation itself is easy to use, however, one needs to create an account to gain access to a 30 days free trial registration that provides access to a limited number of Gismos simulations on the ExploreLearning website.",4
3241,I often use this site in class lectures. A great resource!,5
3242,"1. How you reviewed the materials (Did you spend 5 minutes browsing, 2 hours trying it, or actually use it in teaching-learning activities?). I spent about 20 minutes reviewing the material and playing the game several times.2. The quality of content (Does the materials accurately present concepts and models that are educationally significant?) The game was fun to play, however the website did not describe any obvious reasons why this game would be educationally significant, for college students in particular. 3. The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning (If used appropriately, will students' learning and faculty's teaching be enhanced?) I think this game could be used effectively for teaching/learning in the primary grades, however it doesn?t seem to have much application towards higher education. Also the website didn?t really describe what the purpose of the Bicolor Tower of Hanoi is, except perhaps how to effectively move a series of blocks using the fewest number of moves. Technical Remarks: 4. The ease of using the materials (Will first time users find it easy to use the software?)The materials were very easy to use, and the game was fun to play. ",2
3242,"I read through the site and played the game 4 times. I found it frustrating that the game did not indicate what the lowest level of moves was, or if I did well or not. Because there was no feedback, it gave me nothing to aspire to. I did not feel that this game helped my mathematical understanding in any way. I would not recommend this as a teaching tool, unless it was used for K-8 students.",1

3248,Excellent presentation.  The video in the beginning really makes you feel what it feels like to be bullied - as if you were actually in that situation.  The statistics also gives a real sense of the seriousness of the matter.  It's presented in a manner that would attract and hold the attention of those in that age bracket.,5
3248,"I thought the idea is excellent. We just began an Upstander program at our school to get kids to stop being bystanders when it comes to social awareness, responsibility and then bullying. The video itself brings awareness to the issue, but unfortunately, the power is somewhat lost with the overly-text filled slides and quiz. If there were less text and maybe no quiz, and instead a call to action or larger take away may have been more powerful.Technical Remarks:No technological issues.",3
3248,This resource is designed to raise awareness about bullying and to give the audience a deeper understanding of the related social dynamics.  The video format is compelling and will engage a wide variety of learners.  Follow the technical requirements suggestion to download and play the media from your computer instead of over an internet connection for the best experience.  ,5

3253,"The basic idea behind this lesson of connecting an amusement park to the study of cellular make-up and behavior is clever. The output of the lesson is inherently fun and engaging to the intended students and should get them vested in the project. The author misrepresents the “novelty” factor of the lesson since the theme itself is that of amusement and fun. The lesson itself clearly states the standards it covers. The use of online collaboration is a great way to engage the students as well. The lesson is inclusive to the visual and auditory learner, but may leave out the kinesthetic learners somewhat. The technological needs for the lesson are extensive, but not unreasonable. The lesson needs more explanation to the methods implied for the laymen or beginning instructor. The objective is understandable and tangible for both instructor and student. Overall, a well thought out and entertaining lesson on a difficult subject.",4
3253,"I appreciate that the author begins the lesson by activating student's background knowledge about the topic. Lesson objectives are clearly defined and address a variety of learning styles. Students have the opportunity to create a unique product to demonstrate their understanding of a scientific topic. Designing an activity that allows students to be very creative while connecting to a fun experience (amusement park) provides motivation for students to let their imaginations soar! Web-based resources chosen for this activity provide opportunity for choice and are easy for students to use. Providing a rubric to communicate expectations and guidelines gives students a clear road map for completion. I think the author could add recommendations for how and where students should share their completed projects. I would like clarification on whether all parts of this assignment are to be individually completed, students are working in groups, or a combination of both. Collaboration is referenced throughout the plan, but I am unclear if students should be completing any individual assignments before meeting as a group to complete their Prezi. I like all of the technologies selected for use during this project, and think it is a great way for students to demonstrate their understanding of the components of a typical eukaryotic cell.Technical Remarks:Lesson plan opened successfully on the first attempt.

This would be an example of scaffolding -- using things that the students are already familiar with to create understanding of new concepts. I would be curious to see how you could use technology more to support this lesson. You mention that one of the goals of this lesson is to ""get the students talking"" about how chemistry is part of real life. I think you might be able to have the student contribute to a class blog, or a wiki, and share associations they make in real life with chemistry related concepts. If they contributed to this blog for a week or two weeks, the whole class would probably come up with some really neat ideas/associations that would keep that conversation going outside of the classroom.",4

3321,"This material is well designed for effectively developing one of the basic skills, passing the ball in order to play floorball. The instructional objectives are clearly articulated with four types of knowledge, which range from understanding the concepts to applying knowledge to real world practices. In order to achieve the instructional objectives, the content is accordingly composed of step-by step detailed procedure, feedback styles, individual practices, interactive features, and assessment types. Befitting the type of material, drill and practice, this material provides sufficient and productive opportunities to learn new skills, practice them repeatedly with frequent feedback, and finally acquire the skills. Since this material targets all starting floorball players from the age of 6, the delivery methods or resources need to be modified and changed according to the members of a class. Thus, I think that it would be good to combine and balance demonstrations by both the video clip (Shooting and Passing Video) and coaches for each step. Also, feedback provided by coaches seems to be quite individualized and take a long time to do personal practices and give feedback to each student. It would be good to point out ideal class size and tentative time allotment for each section.Technical Remarks:This material does not require high levels of proficiency in computer skills and much technical support. This material needs a PC loaded with Dartfish, two high-speed video cameras for recording purpose, a projector, and a screen. In order to demonstrate the basic skills and the importance to the students, the author provided the video link to Shooting and Passing Video, which might play an important role in students’ understanding the basic skills theoretically. I think that it will take much time to videotape all the students, review them together, and give feedback to them. It might be an alternative way to choose two to three students for each skill (taking turns), ask the other students what their good points and bad points are (peer review and feedback), and give feedback from a coach’s point of view. It might not be necessary to implement technology into the whole procedure of the lesson.",5
3321,"This resource provides a well-articulated plan for teaching the fundamentals of passing and receiving in floorball. The lesson plan contains the elements of strong lesson design—an introduction, connection to previously learned material, modeling, guided practice, independent practice for skill mastery, and feedback. The plan promotes active learning, which will appeal to many different types of people, especially those who prefer to experience new material rather than just hear about it. For those who need to visualize new concepts, an accompanying video and modeling by the coach help support their learning needs. The lesson also provides frequent opportunities for student choice which will also serve to maximize student engagement. The learning outcome is clearly stated for students and is concrete and attainable. Use this lesson together with the author’s demonstration on the fundamentals of body position, ball position and equipment selection, and you will be a floorball expert in no time!Technical Remarks:Technically, this resource is a simple document outlining basic steps for the lesson. There is a link provided to the video resource, which is a helpful learning support. In order to fully implement all components of the lesson, it will be necessary for the user to have access to a PC loaded with Dartfish and two high speed video cameras to record players and provide instant feedback. LCD projector and screen are also needed to share learning with the whole class. If the technological resources are unavailable, parts of the lesson can definitely be implemented. Don’t let the lack of one or more of the technology components deter you from trying this lesson.",5
3322,"This tutorial is very helpful for understanding the basic skills to play floorball and applying knowledge to real world practices. The author tried to have students use the tutorial to boost the level of self-regulation and autonomy for playing floorball. The tutorial is composed of step-by-step detailed lessons, interactive quizzes, and extra explanations on the quizzes on the answer slides. The three units are coherently connected with explanation of the key concepts for basic skills and real world practices with images. Each short unit and its subsequent quizzes for comprehension checks are especially good for younger learners who usually have worse concentration on a topic. The tutorial is made with clear and direct instructions and intends to activate just learned knowledge and apply it to advanced learning. The students are clearly guided to gain knowledge of what each unit delivers step by step and learn how to play with the balls. The students involve in technology-implemented interactive quizzes for review of the knowledge as well as its application for expanding the skills.Technical Remarks:There were no technical issues throughout the tutorial. The links introduced by the author are all working properly. It might be good to have fewer texts on the explanation slides, especially in unit 1, titled Stick Selection & Hand Positioning. Since this tutorial also targets younger students, if the author inserts designated visual images or pictures and do a voiceover with fewer texts, then it will help them become less distracted. Also, it would be good to add highlighting effects to the texts. If the author emphasizes important words or phrases for having good command of demanding skills on the slides, then it will help students keep them in mind when they are applying the skills to real world practices.",4
3322,"This resource will really help you get a feel for how to prepare yourself for the game of floorball.  The author provides excellent details on how to position your body, choose the right equipment and how to strike the ball.  The descriptive language and clear visuals enable the learner to clearly picture the proper technique for floorball.  The presentation will appeal to many types of learners, especially those who prefer visual modes of presentation.  The presentation promotes active engagement of the learner, encouraging viewers to write down comments, questions and input that would help to improve the it.  I will be anxiously awaiting a companion to this resource that describes floorball rules and game play! Technical Remarks:There were no technical concerns with this presentation.  All links were functional and it was easy to navigate.  One thing that is reassuring to me in a presentation like this is to have an ""exit"" button on each slide.  It is good to know that there is an easy way to get out if need be, but I am sure this is just a matter of personal preference.  The sounds were fun, and the internet links to additional sites and for email feedback are appreciated. ",4

3324,"""Foniks"" is a learn-to-read course where you can just mouse over letters and words to hear them spoken - technologically not so hard, but a huge step forward in the teaching of reading.The printed book, almost 600 years old now, has always suffered from a fatal drawback: books can't talk.  So books on their own can't  teach people a foreign language, or how to read.  But ""Foniks"" allows a direct link between text and speech which sure beats holding a book in one hand while negotiating fast wind buttons with the other.The effect is empowering and motivating for the learner, and has big implications for early learners : a 3-year-old already has the motor skills to manipulate a mouse over large-size text.  Watching three-year-olds bring text to life by making it speak at their command is kind of eerie, I can tell you.After using Foniks, it seems needlessly hard to go back to a silent, paper book, where little can be learnt without the presence of a human teacher or a tape.  But in educational terms, Foniks is conservative.  Don't expect many Disneyesque cuties here - just good old solid learning, with a well-organised syllabus covering all the usual phonics sounds plus many more sounds from phonics' parent, phonetics.  Make no mistake, this course will take you all the way from total illiterate to sentence-length reader.The art-work is hardly inspiring (but with some quaint surprises, such as mouse over the couple to hear their kiss!), and the accents are not everybody's cup of tea - Educated British, similar to an East coast American accent - but it's my guess that learners will love the simplicity,
 transparency and immediacy of this very effective learning tool for aspiring readers of all ages and nationalities.  I just hope it doesn't put too many teachers out of work.Technical Remarks: Mac or PC are OK, IE (preferred) or Netscape with Flash player installed.  Your computer must have sound.",5

You stated very clearly, which is helpful to a teacher wanting to use this material, that “All three types of instruction are included in the project: learner<>learner (they work together and learn from each other; learner<>expert (they learn from me and others online who know more than they do); and learner<>content (they have the book and information online to refer to in order to answer any of their questions.).”Aside from these instructional strategies, I think you did a nice job applying the UDL principals.  I notice you create MP3 files for your students who wish to hear lectures and that you would also provide translated work for ESL students.  Do you find that a translation of information will help them accomplish your objectives?  I ask because I wonder how a final assessment presentation would go.The way you have designed this project around a real world scenario was very clever and, I think, also an exciting scenario for the students.  Nothing like a good adventure challenge!As for the technology used for this project, I think you highlight many areas where technology can be utilized.  Allowing your students to chose their own presentation format will help them create something that caters to their own learning style.  Your rubric links opened, and there were no glitches with this lesson plan.Technical Remarks:There were no technical problems found in this lesson plan.",4

3333,"I really like the objective of this lesson.  The grade book is one of the most important tools of communication between a student and a teacher.  I guess my only question is how exactly you intend to set up the grading system using Google docs.  I think for this resource to be most useful on MERLOT, a little more detail about the structure of the grade book is needed.  Obviously I know what you mean when you say “based on the google docs grade book we currently use in CEP 811,” but all users might not.  Just a thought; thanks for sharing this resource. ",4
3334,"This was a great introduction to both the unit circle (if students have not seen it before) and the graph of a sine function. The review in the beginning and the practice problems helped prepare students to solve for the y values at points along the unit circle eventually leading to the sine graph. I think there was some room for improvement at the review at the beginning only covered the ratios for the different functions and did not include a review example of how to set up an equation to solve for an unknown side. I have found that setting up these equations is more of a struggle for students compared to just writing trig ratios.I think that the flow of the lesson was great. It incorporated a lot of appealing visual elements and the flow of it made sense and was easy to follow. I enjoyed the tip on how to change the mode of the calculator from radians to degrees. I enjoyed how students ""built"" a table by solving a series of problems. Initially I wondered why decimal values were used instead of exact, but this later made the graph much easier to interpret. Overall, I think this stand-alone lesson presented a difficult concept in a very understandable way.Technical Remarks:The powerpoint worked well, all the navigational buttons were fuctional.However, most of the correct answers said ""correct"" which would need to be changed before using this with students. Likewise answers where a student needed to change the angle mode said ""rad"", the answer for using cosine instead of sine said ""cos"", etc.Additionally some of the animations seemed a bit too long, especially the appearance of the forward button. I understand this instructionally as you want to make sure students take adequate time on the lesson, but I found myself reading the slide and then having to wait to move forward.",4
3334,"This interactive PowerPoint provides an exploration of the Sine function.  There are slides with questions that provide immediate feedback to the student as well as suggestions for corrections.  The images/animations incorporated in this resource are helpful to the understanding and comprehension of the material.Technical Remarks:The formatting was off just a little bit.  Some of the slides had images/text overlapping.  I could still read everything but it was a little distracting.  On many of the slides with questions, after the multiple choice options it said which one was the correct answer.  This should be corrected if you're planning to use with students.",4

The pictures are really helpful.  Especially when you talk about embouchure; it's nice to have first the explanation and then the visual.  I think the simplicity is nice.  It gives kids who are learning the information without being overwhelming.  I was a little confused about the music being included... It assumes the kids have the background to know how to play the notes, but I would think that if they can play the notes, they would know the other things you were introducing as well?  I may just be misunderstanding, but that was my thought.   Technical Remarks:Several of the links were broken.  I wasn't able to link from slide 3 and the quiz responses didn't work for me either.  If those things were fixed, I think it would be a great tutorial!",4
3340,"Hi Jason,Coming from a nonmusical background I found your StAIR project interesting in the fact that I learned a little about the trumpet.   Clarity of audience- what is the grade level that this project is geared for?  I wonder if more video clips showing posture positions would have enhanced the concept you are trying to achieve.  Overall, I think you have an audience that would benefit from a StAIR.    Technical Remarks:Some of the links are broken but the few that I were able to view furthered my appreciation of the work that needs to be put forth by the musician to understand the concept.  I am a visual learner and appreciate the images that you supplied in your presentation, but I know we must also be mindful of the other learning styles in our planning.  Would a video embedded with you playing the trumpet sounds add to your work?  This addition would also address the UDL principles and supply differnentiation to your StAIR.",3

I also like the analogies to filling a glass with water, they helped me understand the breathing better. Aesthetically, this StAIR is monotonous and I wish there were more visual examples, video examples, and input from more individuals that play the trumpet. Also, it would have helped to have more aid to some of the vocabulary words like diaphragm and aperture.Technical Remarks:Only two links in the actual presentation work. I had to use the navigational links from the slideshare. It took away from the presentation not to be able to participate in it.  ",3

3350,"I love the idea of making open textbooks out of material that is in the public domain or licensed for reuse. As the previous reviewer mentioned, this isn't just a collection of public domain texts; there are nice introductions to the texts, study questions, and links for further information. My main concerns are:
1. Many of the links are broken; this is not surprising, since the date of the textbook is 2003. But it does reduce the usefulness of the text insofar as one might not want to assign a set of readings and say to students that some links are working but others not, and it's too complicated to say which.
2. The look and feel of the site is rather dated, again unsurprisingly. It is fairly easy to navigate nevertheless, though, so long as you figure out that ""up"" means to go one level up in the organizational structure of the table of contents.
3. This is going to differ amongst teachers, but I found some of the selections too short for what I usually assign in courses in this area. That's going to be different for different institutions and contexts, though.
4. I was surprised that there was no section on utilitarianism in this book on ethics; that's something that is regularly taught in university coures on ethics.
 
I might assign some portions of this text for a course; e.g., I could ask them to read the sections on Epicurus and Epictetus, for example, and just tell them to skip the links (I'll provide my own!).",3
3350,"This is a great collection of public domain texts related to ethics.  While someone via searching could find the full text versions of many of the readings used on this site what makes this collection special is that the texts are organized into categories and that the page for each indivual reading contains key paragraphs from the text, reading questions and information about the author of the text.  It's a nice colelction of readings that feature key points and theories from the history of ethics.Technical Remarks:The site design is simple but it's very easy to navigate back and forth through the site and there is a very helpful table of contents much as you would find in a tradational textbook.",5

3352,"This is a great StAIR to introduce Voicethread.  You covered the basic concepts and provided interactive features in your presentation to keep the learner engaged.  You definitely have conformed to the Universal Design of Learning (UDL) approach in your instruction.  There were minor suggestions that I would like to comment on.  If it is possible, have the audio volume level for both feedback and voiceover be almost equal.  It was so neat to have an option to listen to your instructions as I go through the slides, but when I hit the wrong answer, the feedback was substantially louder than your voice, which made me jump while reviewing it at 4:00 am.  Another is the format consistency in using the action buttons.  There were some buttons which I was assuming were linked to a page or an action, but were really button images being described in the page.",5
3352,"I really liked your presentation on voice threads and thought it was well laid out and organized.  I thought you used many of the UDL principles and used both inductive and deductive learning styles.   The material was presented in many formats including words, pictures, and audio for each slide.   I thought the diagrams and audio did a great job clarifying many of the concepts and helped the learner understand the presentation more clearly.  One area that I thought could be done differently, not necessarily better, would be the questions asked to engage the learner.  I thought that most of the questions were based on either guessing or prior knowledge of the material.  I would at least include some questions that tested what you taught to check their understanding of the material and ensure they are comfortable to try their own voice thread.  The other area I would adjust would be to include the back button at more spots in the presentation so the learner can go back and see the question even if they guessed correctly.  I also really liked how you offered feedback to any learner who would like to create their own thread.  That is an excellent way to get authentic feedback.  I worked on the presentation and write up for 40 minutes.Sincerely,Ethan Fahy",4

3375,"This was a great STAIR for teaching students concepts about lights and mirrors. Working through the project it provided positive feedback for students who answered questions correctly and review points for students who answered questions incorrectly. The addition of a youtube video was a great resource to engage the students before reviewing more material. Real-life examples provided meaningful learning. Having the students create a note sheet at the beginning is a great way to help them focus throughout the presentation.Technical Remarks:The only technical issue I had was trying to open the presentation on my mac with OpenOffice. The file format didn't transfer correctly on my computer, but when opening the document on another computer with PowerPoint I did not have an issue. It may have just been my settings that were causing the problems.",5
3375,"This is a wonderful Stand Alone Resource for students learning about mirrors.  It was very easy to use and navigate with great images and information was clearly thought out and portrayed.  The use of picture and word-based instruction was very nice (The T-Shart slide stood out).  Another strength was the use of the original learning material reposted on the slide that was displayed after the user input the incorrect answer during the quiz.One method that could be used to make every user accessible to the content would be to offer some sort of text to speech function, such as recording your voice for each slide reading the text.  Technical Remarks:It was very easy to use the material.  It was glitch free",4

3378,"So, with my limited knowledge of Linear Programing, I found this material to be very helpful. I wish that I had thought of looking on Merlot to find something like this to help me out w/my LP homework! LP is a fascinating process and is used in multiple facets of the business world. It was very interesting to read further about it and how it relates to evolutionary optimization, such as what is referred to as Swarm Intelligence. By close examination of nature, things such as Data Mining and LP have been inspired. I plan spending more time looking at this site and showing it to my fiancé as he has been helping me w/LP homework! I think this info would have been a great tool for our Math G class to have for added notes to what we also looked at in class. 
As I mentioned, my knowledge of LP is very basic! I can see how the ideas get more complex for students of a higher level. I think the examples used are helpful and the graphs are fantastic! I think it's a great resource for additional information.Technical Remarks:Sadly, I had a lot of problems trying to open the SixPap.zip. I think it has to do w/my technological difficulties more than anything. I downloaded the data but was unable to open it and it removed itself from my computer!

3384,"It is not clear from the introduction whether this book is about micro- or macro-economics. The list of chapters are definately macro- subjects but (and in common with so many others) the start is one of mixing these two subjects, admittingly after they are defined. Students of economics need to appreciate that macroeconomics is not simply scalled-up microeconomics, but that it requires a distant view taken of the system to cover it in a comprehensive way. The ""trick"" is to do this using the least amount of complication and detail. Very few writers have achieved this, and John Petroff is one who has not managed it. When properly done, the resulting model should be fully comprehensive and include all of the 19 possible different specific kinds of activities performed within our social system.
The model which I use and recommend may be found in Wikimedia, commons, macroeconomics, as:  DiagFunMacroSyst.pdf . It also included in the Merlot Diagrams/figures/photographs
It will need to be enlarged in order to identify all 19 double flows of money, goods etc., as noted in the above comment.

3388,"1) I spent about 15 minutes browsing this site and realized that all it is doing is talking up the ""Numbers Juggling"" package in which students are able to learn various mathematic concepts, including multiplication, without the use of times tables through online videos, email and eBooks. (All for only $19.95!)

2) I felt that the quality of the content was good for trying to sell the product they are selling. It made very convincing arguments as to how multiplication is a skill that all of us need to know in order to succeed in math. I only went on this site because the name was interesting and I was curious as to how to teach multiplication without having to use a chart.

3) The potential effectiveness for enhancing teaching and learning in this site would work if one actually buys the learning tools they are selling. I'm curious to see if it really works because I would LOVE to know a shortcut for multiplication tables.

4) The ease of this site was pretty straight forward. It's a lot of reading before you realize that once you click the site that tells you that you will learn more about how the multiplication only by buying their product.",3
3388,"I liked this site,I found that the individual who created the site definitely communicated at an angle that would catch the students attention. The cute name ""Math Mojo"" caught my attention, and I went and browsed around for 15 minutes.The content is rich in depth, the main objective of the Math Mojo site is to ""deepen the knowlege of arithmetic"". It uses a creative spin on words and intersting display of mathematical topics to do just that.There are several examples and thourough explanations that I found to be very helpful to students for addition,division,subtraction..etc.Besides having mathematical content the site empahsizes the importance of being well-rounded in students by also having non-math topics such as a small section on ""understanding the middle east"" with a link to middle east geographical sites. Due to the heavy involvement in the middle east it is important to build awareness amongst youth and show that regardless of obligations to ""school and life"" it is impotant to take time out of what you're doing to understand the world around you. I found this very intersting and  important. Which reinforces the concept and main objective of the site ""deeping knowlege of mathematics""...this in turn branches out to all areas of humanities and motivates  students to understand and deepen there knowlege in all areas of intellect and to seek to deepen the surface level of knowlege. Having a passion for learning is the root to ""understanding""...anything in academia. Technical Remarks: Clear, easy to navigate layout. All links are working. User friendly for first time users ! ",5
3389,It's a nice website,5
3390,This is helpful for students that struggle with mathematical rules. A talented teacher knows that students need to have all aspects of learning covered. Simply reading and practicing math does not always connect the dots for people who struggle with math. Music is often easier to identify and by learning the words to these familiar songs math rules become fun and memorization happens naturally. It is also very interesting to see how math connects with music and when you learn the song you will certainly find out something you did not know!,4

The science lesson plans would serve as a useful model for prospective science teachers; they are well-thought out and include a lot of resources for teachers such as peer evaluation, rubrics, and student handouts.  The math section of this collection, though, is merely a set of challenge problems; although there is an attempt to align them to the math standards, there is no information about how to use them in the classroom or any lesson plans to go along with them.  These challenge problems suffer, too, from over-explanation; they give step-by-step instructions and do not leave much room for student research or experimentation.",3

3402,"This is a GREAT StAIR on nouns and verbs! I think this is an effective way to transform instruction on nouns and verbs into a technology-rich activity. The use of animated clip art and the inclusion of sound foster students’ learning through engaging interaction. All of the visuals and sound effects included will be a great way to meet the needs of visual learners. The activity included scaffolding through the incorporation of explanations and examples, as well as quiz questions for both nouns and verbs. Students are held accountable for their learning by the inclusion of quiz questions along the way, as well as the final review at the end. All of these elements work together to create a fun and motivating activity to help children feel successful in their learning about nouns and verbs.Technical Remarks:It may be beneficial to add a recording of the directions, explanations, and examples to better support all students. I know in first grade there can be a wide range of reading levels, so this might help support students at a lower reading level. I also noticed that when I clicked on the football player on the verb slide, I was taken to the description of the bunny hopping. Also quiz question #2 did not have an arrow to press. Other than these minor details, you did a fantastic job! I cannot wait to use this in my kindergarten classroom!",4
3402,"thought your StAIR was perfect for first graders! I absolutely loved the sound effects that were added to the quiz questions. Each one was different, so it was exciting to not only get the correct answer, but to hear the fun sound that comes along with it. My favorite sound was of the kids in the classroom making noises with their mouths! I think the students will walk away from your StAIR with a solid understanding of nouns and verbs. The way you had the pictures of the verbs moving will definitely be something that the children will remember and associate with action verbs. The sound effects that you added to the verb pictures were adorable! Definitely a strength, as it will accomodate different styles of learning.  With the model of your StAIR the students are learning through inductive teaching, where they are shown information and then tested on what they learned. When you covered the topics of nouns, I noticed that you highlighted the word “noun” and the corresponding person, place or thing. Using this visual clue will help students to make the connection between these words. Great idea for those visual learners! The length of StAIR was appropriate for the student’s age group. I think that the fist bump slide was funny and a great way to connect with the students (appropriate for their generation). You truly were thinking about the age of your audience with the last slide. What a creative idea to use “That’s All Folks!” Amazing job…can’t wait to use it in my classroom!

3422,"It's such a good idea for online learning or in class review. There are some nice visuals to illustrate the concepts, as well as being able to see and hear you, the instructor, to make it more personable. I also thought the small chunks of lecture and illustrations broken up by quizzes is a nice way to review and learn concepts. I even had a chance to look at my answers, and if they were wrong, I could re-watch the video segment.  Students could spand as long as they needed to to learn.  You were also able to include some text from the class.  I think projectile and physics topics like this should be explained in the multiple ways you hit in order for learners to grasp the concepts.",4

3445,I really liked your StAIR project; it was easy to use and follow.  The objectives were clear from the beginning and the videos were very informative.  The only suggestion I would make would be to have some spoken word to go with the written text of some of the videos.  this would bring it more in line with UDL principles. ,4

I believe the Stair would be successful in teaching a novice how to get started on Twitter.  The steps are logical and easy to follow.The outside links to video tutorials and supporting blog posts reinforce the main message well.The quiz questions at the end support a quick recap of the main content.To make this product better I could suggest an edit of some of the audio files.  The recording was done a bit to close to the microphone and the sound is slightly distorted.Technical Remarks:Since I was viewing this PPT on a Mac I did have the usual minor incompatibility issues.  Some audio content would not play and it seemed like possibly a few arrows were where I assume the author put them.,4
3447,"This StAIR is loaded with terms and best practices when collaborating as a group.  I am having trouble determining the appropriate grade level for this.  Lots of big words and elaborate questions.  This could be used to launch the concept of collaboration in the classroom.  Easy to use, and application should be easy to implement.  I might consider shortening up the first few slides and getting more to the point of the later slides.  Technical Remarks:The presentation flows well, some slides are timed, some are click-response driven.  Good use of colors and easy to navigate.  Good technical work.",3
3447,"You included great information about collaboration. The video at the beginning was really interesting! I liked that you included checks after each section.  One thing I think you could improve was making it so there wasn't so much reading to obtain the information.  While I am very interested in the idea of collaboration and making it work better in my classroom, the information was a little dry and I lost interest after a little while.  Maybe give more examples and shorten the information to bullet the main points.Technical Remarks:It was a little confusing at times to get from one section to the next.  If you answered a question wrong, for example, I wasn't sure at first which button would take me back to the questions.  There was no option to go directly back to the questions, only back to the information.",3
3447,"Very detailed. Seems a bit simple for adults, but I like the fact that there are quizzes along the way of learning. It ensures that the audience is paying attention and following along. The ""help"" buttons also are a great idea. I just wish the ""home"" button took us to a table of contents so we could go back and review certain concepts if we thought we needed to do so. ",4
3448,"The Statistical Abstract contains a wealth of statistical information on a wide variety of subjects. The site has the latest version and the issues for the two previous years. The 1999 version (most current at the time of this review) had over 1400 tables grouped into 31 sections. The data includes statistic on demographics, governmental services, and economics. The data is primarily for the United States, but the publication also contains some international statistics.Technical Remarks:This website has a hotlink to the full content of the Statistical Abstract. You will need to have an Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your computer to access this content which is in PDF format. The Adobe software can be downloaded from a link on the page that comes up when the link for Adobe Acrobat PDF files is clicked.It is possible to copy data from these tables and paste it into an Excel spreadsheet for data analysis or graphing. This can save time and reduce the errors of manually inputting data into a spreadsheet.The site also has hotlinks to selected more popular tables from the abstract in HTML format, and also hotlinks to other commonly requested statistical data.",5
3449,This looks like a fun way to learn about Tokamak design.  A link is provided for a good introduction to fusion research.  ,5

3450,Easy to read and very interesting and helpfulTechnical Remarks: easy to navigate and find info,5
3450,I really enjoyed looking over the material on this web site.  This is a great web site.Technical Remarks:  I spent about an hour reviewing this web site.  The material on this web site was easy to read and very eay to understand.  The information that I found here was just what I needed.  Thank You,4
3450,"I spent about half hour reviewing. This is of helping to support and to educate stepfamilies. They provide a lot of information for stepfamilies how they have to go trough their situations. This is not only helpful for stepfamilies, but also for people who never experiece devoce to understand this specific situation. However, I don't think that is effective for academic purposes. This is just a reference material for anyone who is interested in this issueTechnical Remarks: It is very easy to use. ",3
3451,There are many good ideas here to better connect with and reach all of the EL students. Partner English learners with strong English speakers is a good way for Els to hear proper pronunciation and get clarification if they need it.,4
3452,"Applet is limited by the fact that only two vectors can be added.  Still useful, but there are better applets available.",3
3453,This seems like a very good and easy to use database for K-12 students to use to find credible sources for doing research. All sources are checked by educators and experts before being added.,5
3454,"Short, but interesting.",3
3455,"I thought this site was interesting. It wasn't what I expected so it caught me off guard but it is still good information none the less. It talked about the different ways that people teach money, the way it works, what it means. I never really  thought about learning about money, It was so long ago. It isn't an easy concept to grasp, especially when you're young. This would be a good place to go for a parent having trouble teaching money because it gives creative, new ways to teach it that someone might not have thought about. Its not extremely mathematical but it is a very practical application of math.",3
3456,"There are some excellent tutorials on this web site, along with some great resources and links.  The forums are a great way for people to collaborate and discuss ideas.  My only problem is the organization.  It seems a little disorganized and could be put together a little better.",4
3456,Looks a like good site to find a lot of Photoshop tutorials.  Would be useful in a course on using Photoshop and also for the personal user.,4
3456,One of the best and most up to date Photoshop sites I have ever been to.  New techniques are posted almost weekly along with easy to understand tutorials and graphic helpers.   A good bookmark for every type of web student.  Technical Remarks: tech:  A little slow to upload because of the depth of the graphics.  A good site for any tech to spend time in. ,5
3457,"The author's list of pros (diamonds) and cons (rocks) is cleaver and well positioned in this paper and helps make her case. They are important to keep in mind, especially for any institution looking to improve its QEP in the area of technology-delivered assessment.",4
3458,A great site to show the power of what .NET can do!,4
3459,"I spent about 5 hours reading everything in this site. But you may choose specific topics to reduce time. This site is very informative and understandable for people with mental retardation and related developmental disabilities and their family.  Especially, the information section is very helpful to understand for me as a student.  The resources section might be more helpful for teachers.Technical Remarks:I didn't have any problem to access and the address is very simple. This is very organized and you may easily find out that you specifically want to.",4
3459,This web site was very informative and provided much information about people with mental disabilities and their families involved. It was easy to understand and can be useful for students and teachers.Technical Remarks:It was easy to find on the net and it took about an hour to go through the whole website.,5
3460,"Ready...set...go! Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and random operations--(a mix of all operation in no particular order.) You have 60 seconds to do as many math problems as you can. I spent about 15 minutes on this site. It shows you: how many you get right, how many you miss,(which a small pop-up appears and gives you the right answer,) and when the 60 seconds are up, it tells you how many you did all together and the amount you got correct. You also get to choose the number increments, 0-12, to practice with. I think this is a great exercise for elementary school children to practice what they have previously learned. This test your knowledge, and  enhances your skill to think quickly and precisely. It makes you stay on your toes. Excellent for school and at home as well.Technical Remarks:Software is very easy to use. Just push the ""go"" button to start the timer, and input your answer in the box; then click ""check answer.""  There is also a ""stop"" button if you want to stop, and just start over.",4
3461,"Currently using this site as the primary location for an online unit on public/street art. In addition, I will be including theartstory.org as one of a very few websites deemed acceptable for inclusion in a paper and/or project's reference list (APA) or Works Cited (MLA).",5
3462,"This article gives great ideas and information on classroom management. It addresses fears, and issues that an instructor might encounter regarding students' behavior. I appreciated the fact that not only does it list common classroom obstacles but also how to overcome them.",4
3463,"Nice graphics, but I am not sure what this applet is designed to demonstrate.",3
3464,"There is something wrong with the interface.  Windows don't resize correctly, and none of the buttons seem responsive.  I never did figure out how to make it work.",1
3465,I spent about 30 min reviewing materials on this website. I thought it was very interesting. It told me alot. Technical Remarks: It was very easy to follow and to properly get to the issues that I wanted to learn more about.,4
3465,I spent over an hour reviewing the material on this web site. The quality of the material was very good. It is a great site to learn all about highly gifted children. This site is not only great for students but also a great site for faculty. It tells how teachers can help to make learning for the highly gifted more rewarding and more challenging. All around it is a great site.Technical Remarks: This site is great for first time users. It is easy to navigate and has lots of other great sites you can link to. ,5
3466,"This is a wonderful educational web site for three reasons.  The first is that it gives the reader a glimpse into the complex process and economics of glass making in northern India during the 1820s.  The second is that it is so well footnoted that even a beginning college student can wander through the text and make sense of it.  The third, although this text's shikasteh script is especially legible, students of classical Persian literature who have had little time with actual Persian manuscripts can get a virtual first-hand experience here.",5
3467,"Interesting variety of texts from different traditions, not just religious texts. For example, the complete text of Mooney's Myths of the Cherokee (1900) is included.",4
3467,"This site has an amazingly extensive collection of religious/sacred texts. Most appear in translations completed during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The site also contains scholarly and popular works from this period on specific religions, etc. Considering the age of the translations and the secondary literature, users need to exercise caution when consulting these documents. Nevertheless, the value of having these texts readily available online is likely to outweigh this concern.",4
3468,I would possibly use the site in my online classes.,3
3469,"Frustration is the word that comes to mind in my numerous attempts to solve this puzzle.  I love the challenge the 3 different puzzles instigated.  I wish there would have been an article to go along with this so that they might tell us the mathematical point behind the strategy.  I tried all 3 puzzles for about 10 minutes EACH, and never once won! I did get down to 2 balls left, but then I forgot how I did that and could not get back to that number again!Technical Remarks: I am not sure if this puzzle correlates to anything in our class because there was not additional information provided except for the puzzles themselves, but it was a nice break from the ordinary reading.  It is nice to be able to interact and try different solutions to a VERY seemingly impossible problem.  Again though, I really would like to know how to solve the problem - any suggestions??",3
3469,"There was no explanation on how and why they chosed to use triangle to a puzzle. I spent some time trying to solve the three games, and was not solving it. Over and Over trying different ways jumping over one ball over the other, and for some reason I was not solveing the tri puzzle. I learned from my class that not all puzzles can be solved. I thought this web page was very fun and mind boggling. I am willing to spend more time to try and get only one ball left on the triangle. Overall I thought this was one of many enhanced teaching styles in the math. I give it two thumbs up.",2
3470,easy to understand and interactive,5
3470,"While this material is specifically designed for the health care industry, the concepts of cultural competence can fit within the parameters of many service industries including education.  The key mini modules that discuss: Knowledge, Skill, Awareness, Encounters, and Desires, sum up the need for greater understanding of the growing diversity within our communities. I plan on using this in my classroom as a supplement to our study of the Native American culture.Technical Remarks:Easy to use, flexible, attractive.",5
3470,This is a great tutorial! I wish I had found it before I did my lecture for cultural assessment in the classroom! Well done.,5
3471,"As a student of history in general and as a secondary social studies education major, I find this website incredibly fascinating and interesting. It is something to compare over fifty years worth of TV ads and see the common threads that appear throughout the years.",5
3472,"After about 3 hours of exploring this website, I'm quite impressed with what it has to offer.The Metropolitan Museum website presents a  multitude of images and information about the visual arts in its collection, as well as several links to other significant web-sites world wide.  The  program features artwork from a variety of eras  which can be explored in depth.  It also integrates multidisciplinary ideas.   The web site seems to be consistent with the high standards for which the Metropolitan Museum is well known.This source can be an effective tool for a student  exploring a topic.  It can also provide guidelines for an instructor in discussing various dimensions of a piece of art.  This source is appropriate for art and design students of all levels, and can be quite relevant and interesting to those in other disciplines as well.Technical Remarks: The web site overall has an excellent and  user-friendly layout.  However, it is as massive as  the Metropolitan Museum itself, and sometimes it  does get a bit confusing where to find which  resources in the education area.  However, the web design concern is minor in comparison to the overall quality of this web site.  ",5
3472,"After several visits totaling just under ten hours, I finally found myself exhausted by the shear volume of information available on The Metropolitan Museum of Art!?s website.  What I find most impressive, however, is that the high quality of the material is maintained from subject to subject.There is great potential for this site to be used for enhancing teaching and learning.  In particular, the !?Educational Resources!? and !?Explore & Learn!? sections are specifically formatted with educators and students in mind.  In addition to suggestions for incorporating site material into classroom activities and lessons, there are links to external organizations focused on education.Technical Remarks: I was able to navigate through the site without too many problems.  However, a co-worker with less browsing experience had difficulty finding information on a particular collection, although I had e-mailed her the website's URL.  Others with limited browsing experience may also be overwhelmed with the many menus, pages, and links on this site.",4
3472,"I found this site to be very unique.  There is a lot of information available within this web site, although at times I found it very difficlut to navaigate my way through.  There are many beautiful items available for viewing and purchasing.  If you have an interest in fine arts; sculptures, paintings, books, or jewlery, this is the site for you!",4
3472,"I spent a few hours reviewing this site.  I found it to be very interesting. Some of the pieces of work that they have there, no other museums would be willing to show.  This site offers content that dates back to the A.D. years.  I think the material that this site offers is excellent information if you are into fine arts.  Students and teachers who want to learn about the history of the fine arts would learn alot from this site.  I find it to be very educational if you are an art major or someone who wants to learn about the arts.Technical Remarks: I feel there is a lot of information on this site. There is a lot of different sites that you can go look at.  It could be difficult for someone to navigate through, because there is so much to look at. ",4
3473,Oyez is an outstanding resource.  I teach two law related courses at the university level and Oyez is alwyas a part of my syllabus and resources.  I love the summaries of the arguments and I especially like to be able to send students back to listen to the actual oral arguments and--when it happens--the justices reading an opinion or dissent from the bench.  It gives students a human and inside look at how legal opinions are made.,5
3473,"This website is from the Chicago-Kent College of Law and contains information related to the Supreme Court.  It reports on the case opinions and has links to the briefs.  It also has other material related to the Court, like lectures by the Justices.",5
3473,"Between this site and LII from Cornell - you can cover the Supreme Court without missing a beat. Much more user friendly than the official government sites, and easy to navigate the links.",5
3474,Applet suffers from a lack of explanatory text and some poor graphics.  ,2
3475,I never was able to figure out how to control the applet.  ,2
3476,"I spent a bit more time on this site than I would care to admit. I get a little worried when I start seeing human behavior turned into different values entered into a numerical matrix. No matter how many options or choices are provided, they still won't be entirely capable of compensating all of the variables involved in the human thought process. Although this sort of thing isn't my cup of tea, I could appreciate the work and organization involved.   The real reason I logged on and viewed so many of the links on the page was that I had a difference of opinion regarding some of the associations made in the section ""Ethic based on the Prisoners Dilema"", and felt the authors view on racism, xenophobia, and affirmitive action were from a bit too narrow of a perspective. Comments made came from a majority vs. minority perspective, and they left out minority vs minority interactions. Some of the worst examples of racism, and prejudice I have witnessed come from minorities directed at other minorities. Affirmative action also assumes that all minority groups perform at a substandard level, and this is a disrespectful approach considering the hard work and accomplishments of several ""minority"" groups.   I did have some problems with some of the links, but overall was a great site. I think my personel views may not make me the best judge if this would be a good tool in a classroom environment. Definitly a good discussion topic.",4
3476,I spent a lot of time browsing through this site.There turned out to be so much more information then I thought.The content of material was very good. Various ideas were given on the main topic. This site has lots to offer to both teacher and student as far as finding different was to relate the tpoic to others or classes.It was very easy to use this site. I was able to move from page to page with ease.,4
3476,I quickly browsed through this sight and didn't get to try any of the teaching/learning activities.  From what I saw the models seemed to represent the concepts.  I think this sight would be a great teaching/learning tool because of it's in depth step by step process of describing everything.  The sight was easy to use and first timers should have no problem with it.  It is set up in sections which breaks it down for the person.,4
3476,"I did not know what the prisoner?s dilemma was, but this site taught the problem very nicely and also has nice animations to show the visual aspects.Technical Remarks:Runs fine in WIN98 and Explorer",4
3477,I spent 15 - 20 reading the material.  It is very informative in showing the relationship between use case models and requirements study.  The article is detailed in regard to   requirements discovery and the user?s role.  This article is a good supplement to the Systems Analysis course I am taking.,4
3477,"Spent 30 minutes carefully reading through webpage.  The information was great, but as a new software engineering student, much of the terminology was not second nature and I had to pay close attention to what I was reading.  The author started at a general view of requirements traceability and with each section got a little more detailed.  It was nice to be eased into the topic instead of thrown into it. The author had several graphics which adequately illustrates the concepts.  Although this material was very informational, it should not be used in the classroom.  The level of the intended audience is slightly higher than a new student.  It would however make an excellent outside course reading for someone with the motivation to take it to the next level.",4
3478,Great work! looks like  there is a lot of potential in this setting.,5
3479,This is avery good book espacially for those who intend to prepare online content.I have found it very useful ,4
3480,This is a good site but I had to follow some of the links out to where I really wanted to be. I have been discussing weather phenomenon lately in my adult ESL class (including EL NINO/NINA). Explore the links but pay close attention to a very helpful FAQ section. Good graphics too! Content is good. Student learning should be efficient. Material is immense but be patient and follow the many links.,4
3481,"Well written, easy to follow site for learning the concepts and simple code for java beans.

3489,"Like I said before, teaching moles is a very difficult concept for students to learn.  I think the video is a great resource for students along with your stair.  I also like how the students are working independently on what they need to be working on.",4
3489,"Given that math can be a difficult concept for many students, your sequencing of the lesson seems very appropriate. The video is a great way for students to see and hear the lesson.  If they need to see or hear it again they can do it as many times as they need to without holding other students back.  Google Docs is a great way for students to collaborate with one another and share information. Teaching others is the best way to know you learned material, by using Google Docs, students will have the confidence to know they learned how to calculate moles. As a teacher, you can see who participated as well.Technical Remarks:In order to make this a more social assignment, students could blog about what they learned and reply to another student’s response.",4
3489,"I like the way you have set up the plan for teaching about moles. You have some type of mixed classroom and students are not all working on the same subject. Since you have a lot of independent learning, the technology is a great way to introduce the subject. The videos would be an excellent way to show the students how to do the calculations and show them the amount of substance you are calculating. Your stair project is a nice piece for this lesson. If you add a video, the learning experience would help all types of learners. Some need to hear about it, some need to see it, and some need to read it. Your lesson would acomplish all of these needs with the video accomponied by your stair.Technical Remarks:For the socialization aspect, if you had some students in class working on chemistry, they could work together to calculate some problems then collaborate on some questions about the process. My other suggestion would be to have some type of discussion board on a Wiki that the students could have some discissons on about the caculation of moles and what it means.",5
3490,Cute applet to add two vectors that are given in polar form. This is a continuation of the same author?s applet for components. The complete solution can be displayed if the student so desires. Good applet for some drill and practice on converting between coordinate systems and addition of vectors.Technical Remarks:Runs fine under WIN98 and Explorer.,4
3490,"By allowing the ability to test the student, this applet has a versatility that most other applets lack.  For those wanting to create assignments, this applet should be ideal.",4

I was astounded at how much my students appreciated these lessons.  These are inquiry-based lessons that work, but they also show that all kinds of people can become real scientists.Technical Remarks: Only two lessons are available without cost.  The other 18 lessons in the book are equally engaging for students.

3504,I thought this was a good topic to address because we take for granted that choosing the most appropriate productivity application would be simple. This tutorial could be reviewed each time a project is assigned or a new productivity tool is introduced in a class. The description on the MERLOT page is very thorough and descriptive. The only drawback to the title is that it is not clear what WP is until you read the description or start the presentation. This may hinder someone from finding it. The presentation was very easy to use and clearly labeled. I would use this as a resource too. The addition of video and image helps motivate the users to stay engaged. I wonder how many excel music videos are out there? The feed back during the short quizzes is good and placing the quizzes at the end of each topic provides scaffolding for the user. Maybe some quiz questions could be placed at the very end. I liked the instructional strategy used in the presentation to summarize the content at the end of a topic. This should help reinforce learning. There is good use of images and some video. One drawback is the dependence on text and reading. Adding some speech to supplement to other information would be helpful to some users.,4
3505,"Though I’m not an expert on what students should and shouldn’t be able to do as readers and writers at an early age, I do teach students at the grade level this lesson is intended for (first grade?).  The lesson does seem to be very age appropriate and it contains a variety of learning activities for students with different learning styles (visual, auditory and kinesthetic).There was a link to a web site contained in this plan (starfall.com) which I went to and explored for a bit (FYI: I had trouble using this site on Firefox for some reason.  It seemed to work just fine on Safari).  According to this lesson plan, the teacher models navigation through this web site.  It is not clear whether or not students will have a chance to use the web site on their own or in small groups at some point.  Having said this, giving students the chance to use this site on their own or in small groups would seem to be very appropriate since it does seem very age appropriate.Technical Remarks:As I stated in my comments, I had trouble accessing starfall.com on Firefox but it seemed to work just fine on Safari.",4

The scroll bar on the right disappears and only partially reappears as it's being adjusted. The graphic itself might benefit from some representation of the coefficient the user is adjusting. Although the value of r changes in the bar below the image, if some line or bar could be seen changing within or alongside the image - rotating as the curve rotates to keep the correct orientation - the number at the bottom might have more meaning. (You could also add space to the left of the """"r"""" in the field.) You might also want to include the equation that generates the curve, with the values changing dynamically to match the slider adjustment and changing surface. This applet is 90% there. I can't wait to see this when it's perfected!",4

The user can create images for logos based on customized text, in 21 different styles.  Since the logo is created based on the user's inputs, there are no copyright restrictions on its use.To create a logo, the user types in the desired text, selects the style, enters some information regarding size and background, and clicks a button. Within less than a minute, the logo is created, and can be immediately downloaded by the user.The site can create customized buttons in six styles, with whatever text, color and size the user inputs. There is also a capability for creating images for bulleted lists. The user can select size options, color choices, surface effects, and light properties for the bullets.Technical Remarks:The images are held on the server for less than an hour after they are created. Therefore the user needs to download them soon after they are created.The page said to use (Shift-)Click to download the created images, but I had to use right clicks with my mouse to download them to my PC.Some of the image files may be relatively large, which could slow the load times for web pages.",5

It appears that there are games available for a number of disciplines, not just the physical sciences.  While it is geared for younger audiences, it does not appear to be condescending or too terribly cartoonish.  I also like the options of recieving newletters and taking quizzes on current Laureates.",5

It provides the viewer with other resources including good field guides and books for young learners.  One truly valuable use for the site comes from the tables it supplies.  It has different tables for each of the mineral properties, listing for example, the various ways to group colors.  It also gives you good ideas on how to describe these colors including a list of words that help describe the intensity of color and the distribution of the color.  This is especially helpful for new learners.  At the bottom of the main page it also has a glossary of words and a link for a geological dictionary to provide extra support.

3527,"This website features a game formatted like ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?""  There are questions on the planets and solar systems with 4 multiple choice answers.  When you choose the right answer you get increasingly more money until you reach one million and win.  The game also has 3 hints to be used at any time if you don't know the answer.  I think this is a great tool to use as a unit review for a class.  The only thing lacking in my opinion, is that there are only 12 questions in total, meaning if you guess incorrectly and start over the same exact questions are there.  It would be nice if there were a larger data base of questions.  Overall, I think it's a good tool to use in the classroom, and I like the concept of playing a game that enhances learning while also being fun for the students.Technical Remarks:There were no technical issues on the website.

The instructor can use these weblogs to assign readings and/or assignments for any course in which current events are important. Since the news headlines come from over 1500 sources, grouped into several hundred categories, the information could be useful for a wide variety of academic subjects. User comments on the BLOGGER site indicate that one English instructor is using it for classroom discussions and debates.Technical Remarks:This website was approximately one week old at the time of this comment, and the user interface was somewhat awkward. I rated this site at 4 stars because of the difficulties with the interface.

It also provides vivid pictures of the different parts of the computer to give you a better understanding of the computer.  One thing I really liked is the fact that the site is continually updated.  There is even an update page so you can see what has been updated. Technology is always changing--so you must update websites that deal with it. I feel that this is a great site for those wanting to learn about PC's, even though it can get a little more technical than one might want.Technical Remarks: Part of the site is restricted unless you purchase a license to use it which is not that expensive.  There is enough free information that the general user will really not need to purchase a license.  Any of the highlighted words that you click on will require that you purchase a license.  All information is laid out clearly.  It does take a little time for the pages to load if you are using a dial-up connection.",5

Pappas asserts that each group has experiences that may be reflected upon superficially, very deeply, or at various levels in between. I have used this work to guide my construction of ""reflection"" sections of scoring rubrics.Technical Remarks:This material is presented in a series of blog postings. The author is careful to interlink the various entries, but this may be a bit challenging for some audience members who are not familiar with the intricacies of navigating the blogosphere.",4
3559,This website gives great facts and information on different types of animals in an appropriate grade level.

The text centers around Spanish-speaking culture throughout the Americas (beginning with the United States) and Spain. Each unit also has grammar and vocabulary review.Registered users of the site also have access to pedagogical resources, proving that the editors are focused on the fundamentals of second language acquisition. The creators of Acceso have also anticipated improving the site through collaboration from intrcutors using the textbook. I am very impressed with both the form and content of this site and hope that it will be adopted by teachers around the country very soon.Technical Remarks:While the site is fairly easy to navigate, the one hangup I have regards the separation of grammar and vocabulary from the cultural units. Integrating these may make the text more seemless, and more akin to a textbook format that students and teachers already expect to see.",5
3564,"Excellent website Mirna. It provides several guidelines and techniques that are crucial in managing and evaluating Accessibility. It also specifically address strategies to make the internet available to people with disabilites. I also found EARL - Evaluation And Report Language, which is a format to combine, exchange and analyze results from different web accessibility evaluation tools. The first EARL 1.0 version was published lately, in Sept, 2006. I think being aware of such evaluation tool will come very handy when comparing result to choose the one that the teacher will be utilizing in his or her classroom. The website provides a detaild look on WCAG 2.0 version which is a working draft for overviewing the Web Content Accessibility Guidlines.It also discusses the differences between WCAG version 1.0 and version 2.0.

I think that when designing web pages, it is important to keep in mind that simplicity is not only very essential to people with disabilities but also to any people.",4
3567,Excellent resource for helping students learn math. I like the voice and sound effects and the animations are very smooth and engaging.Technical Remarks:The resource would not work on my MacBook using Keynote or any other program I tried. I had to move it to a PC that had powerpoint installed. So it seems like to need Powerpoint.,4
3567,"This is not only functional, but it's adorable to look at for younger children. In terms of making this universal for all learners, I think there are places that will require more steps, but overall, it is simple, easy and a great tool to use in the future. It was well-designed, and I could see the thought process in terms of younger students, but I'm thinking there will need to be some prior knowledge given to kids with the idea of a tens frame. Have the students already seen this? Would you go through this PowerPoint with them? I have older students, so I may be off a bit. I loved the pictures and the movements of the circles--very helpful and animated. Audio helps too.Technical Remarks:There were some link and audio issues, but with a few technical quick fixes, you're good to go.",4
3567,This resource is designed to teach kindergarten and first grade students basic addition concepts.  The material here is challenging but clear using auditory and visual cues to engage the learner.  Students are required to properly answer quiz questions in order to proceed through the content.  This resource does include links to urls which may require some user configuration to work properly.,4
3567,"The assessment and feedback are great in this material. Also several ways of learning how to count were covered which is great for covering different learning styles. An outside source was provided very early in the material. The source may have been useful to teachers but the material itself feels like it is meant for young children, therefore the external link may not be helpful.I think with a few tweeks this would make a great stand-alone resource in the classroom.Technical Remarks:There may have been an issue with the sounds. I only got sound effects for wrong answers. However the layout and deign of the material is easy to use and follow. I did have an issue around quest 3 of the second quiz. Sum of 11+4. 15 was not an availabe answer. I then had to try and guess which answer would advance me to the enxt question/slide.

3572,"I reviewed the martial for about 30 minutes. The Material was organized extremely well. If all sites were to fallow this example it would be great. The information appears to be very factual as helpful. The author attempts to make the reader feel like they are not alone with poems, personal experiences, and that of others. As an educational or resource site I gave the highest rating; Although this seems to be more of a self help site, I feel all the information one could provide about Alzheimer?s is here.Technical Remarks: Fist time users will have no trouble understanding the dynamics of this site.",5
3573,"This lesson aims to help students learn about, define, and share their community. The authenticity of learning in this lesson is evident because students use real-world examples to create a presentation of their own community. It is a great idea to use multi-media to help students brainstorm about their community. I also like that students interview at least two members of their community for this lesson; thus, this lesson provides students with varied ways to express themselves. Technical Remarks:Lesson is in Google Drive.",4
3573,"This lesson on communities follows the principles of a goal-oriented instructional design plan that also applies UDL learning principles.  The educational need this lesson addresses is helping high school students to learn about, define, and share their community.  The author of this lesson will help students accomplish this task by having them interview members of their community, synthesize their information, and share their unique definition with a larger audience using Web 2.0 technology.  Because this activity is personal to each student the author encourages her students to take pride in self discovery.  This lesson plan is well thought out, organized, and very thorough.  Technical Remarks:This lesson requires computers, internet access, Web 2.0, and plenty of time in a computer lab for a successful lesson.",4
3573,"This is a thorough lesson that guides teachers through introducing and building upon student knowledge of communities. I appreciate that this lesson activates student's background knowledge through graphic organizers. I also like that the goal of this lesson is for students to construct their own meaning of community and not simply memorize a definition from a book. This lesson includes interviewing community members, as well as a final presentation at the end.Technical Remarks:Lesson is in GoogleDrive",4
3573,"This is a lesson plan that is intended to familiarize students with the idea of community membership. It is simple to follow and could easily be accomplished by most students. It could also be adapted for use with younger students, perhaps exploring their school community by interviewing students and staff, or their home community by interviewing family members. One thing that I am unclear of is the context in which this would be taught. Is this meant as a sociology lesson, technology lesson, or something else? Technical Remarks:The technology used is flexible enough that teachers and students can use the resources they have available in order to successfully implement this lesson plan and complete the project.",4
3575,"Based on the description, I was expecting to see a variety of artists in a variety of theater careers.  This video (approximately 22 minutes) follows two Broadway performers, one male with a role in Kinky Boots and the other a female in Pippin.  Both actors are people of color which is a plus.  Their personal stories are interesting but this did not give me any insight into anything other than the lives of these two actors.    I could see using this as reflective material in an advanced acting class but not in the capacity as a ""Guide to Careers in the Theater"" and not in an introductory course.  ",2
3576,"I spent about 30 minutes on the site through the link.  The link is to the website  americantheatrewing.org.  Instructors could use this link to find things ahead of class for students to view and can use it in class to show them particulars, however I would not send students to this link without clear instruction.  The site is hard to navigate and you need to search around quite a bit to find something specific.   I did like the section under ""programs"" that introduced ""The Intern Network"" (TIN).  In the past, I have used individual Youtube videos from American Theater Wing in class and for students to view as homework but I just give them the link right to the specific video, for example, ""Working in the Theater: Scenic Design.  I find searching American Theater Wing (with the topic you need, actor, director, etc.)  on Youtube an easier way to find exactly what I am looking for quickly.  I didnt find this link to be one students could peruse effectively or easily on their own.",3

3581,"Chris - This was well done the first time around, and you have done nice job integrating the minor suggestions we provided.  You should be proud of this work, and now it is available for the (Merlot) world to see!

Congrats!",4
3582,It took approximately 15 minutes to read the material.  It is very precise and links to the Software Engineering class I am presently attending.  Technical Remarks: The concepts and models helped to further my knowledge of newer design documenting techniques.,4
3583,"A collaboration between composers, performers and theologians, primarily associated with the University of St. Andrews. Sir James MacMillan is the heavy hitter here, but I also recognized composer Paul Mealor. Very well done; would consider collecting this if it were only a print book, but grateful to save money and space. As course material, it's pretty specialized, but would be useful in any kind of sacred music seminar.",5
3584,"As a student in graduate level courses, I have used this site extensively as either primary or secondary resources for my classes. The wealth of material that is available here is amazing, and it's clear that this is a project carried out by those with a true passion for presenting the great essayists of the Spanish-speaking world. For that reason, the texts are authentic and well presented, and more is being added to the site all the time. I used this one year ago for a course about the Latin American essay as a vehicle to discovering identity, and continue to use it as I prepare for my Comprehensive exam.  This site has most definitely enhanced my learning by providing an easily available resource to some documents which are otherwise difficult or expensive to obtain. The background information on each of the essayists is also invaluable as an additional source of information about the time in history about which these men and women wrote. None of the essays are overly long, which makes the reading not overly burdensome.Technical Remarks: The navigation around the site can sometimes seem a little puzzling, but there is a search engine for the site which will always lead one to the information that is being sought. ",5
3585,"This is a cool lesson. The discussion is fantastic. If a student hasn’t had the opportunity to travel a lot within the state it will allow them to live other experiences and maybe spark a desire to visit some places.  The depth of learn that can take place in this lesson is great.  It has a logic side, Math, English and even some creativity.  Great Job!Technical Remarks:Everything but the links at the bottom was flawless.  As for inside the lesson plan, technology use is great.  The student will have a good opportunity to learn how to use the internet and some software.",5
3585,"I like this lesson. It can easily be applied to other states, which is nice, and it allows the students to be creative while learning about their home-state. There is a lot you can do with Google Maps so this is also something great to introduce students to.Technical Remarks:Google Maps can be a little overwhelming for some students unless you are using the most basic features (mapping a trip). For this lesson, some of the more advanced features could be used/featured nicely but some worktime with the students would be needed to show them how to use the features.",4
3585,"I really like this lesson and would like to modify it to use in my own classroom next year! I think it's very helpful to have the classroom discussion regarding places to visit in Michigan prior to conducting any individual research. We have a very mobile population at my school so that would be critical since the students aren't as familiar with their state. I also think it's a great way to practice the technology skills of google maps and publisher in a meaningful way for the students. You could also incorporate Excel for the budget portion if you wanted to extend the lesson to include another type of technology.Technical Remarks:I was excited to see that you included the handouts at the bottom of the page, but the link didn't appear to be there or it didn't work. I would love to see those!",5
3586,"Have you ever want to travel the world, but don't have the money? Here is the perfect applet for you. This is a perfect applet for people who want to see a little bit of each major city in the world. The pictures in this applet are updated almost every hour so you can really see the whether in each city.

3588,"This STAIR project demonstrates a great job in introducing the shapes and its different kinds. The presentation clearly introduced, explained and practiced the concept very well. It was very well organized and appropriate for lower elementary grades. Fonts, slide layout, images, animation, and transitions were easy to view and read. The videos were not working. On the video slides, there were text included and the video but there was no audio. It might be a good idea to include audio for those as well since the presentation is for young students. It would also be a good idea to have audio on the first and last slide. In addition, it would be useful to explain how to go from one slide to another or what to do when you got a correct or incorrect answer. Adding audio might help in explaining the process at the beginning of each section. It would be helpful to have some sort of explanation when getting the wrong answer. Overall, it is a great presentation and I am sure that your students will enjoy working through it.Technical Remarks:The videos were not working.",4
3589,"This site is an excellent source of multimedia RLOs for contemporary art genres.  Learning materials on this site are  extensive, interactive, and comprehensive, and cover accompanying historical, sociological, and language-related subjects.Technical Remarks:There were a few broken links in some of the artists' sites. Otherwise, navigation was intuitive.",5
3590,"I find the ArtsEdge site remarkably useful for students in my Theatre Education course, most of whom are planning to be elementary teachers.  The site includes the standards for Arts Education, which can be sorted any number of ways, and lesson plans, with cross-referencing to the standards in the arts fields as well as other subject areas (math, science, etc.)  The lessons and workshops are very detailed, and provide both potential resources for future teachers to use ""as is"" and models for their own lesson development.",5
3591,"This is a visual dictionary for American Sign Language containing numerous ""everyday"" signs as well as the categories of ""religious signs"" and ""phrases"". There is also a special section called ""ASL for Babies"" to tap into the idea of teaching babies to sign as a way to communicate before they can speak. 
This site is fairly usable - it requires Flash to be installed in a browser, and apparently has trouble with Internet Explorer. Some technical knowledge may be required. There is also a mobile app which I did not review. The site shows videos connected to a dictionary - users can search for a word or browse the available words and watch the videos to see the signs in action. There may be some technical difficulties for those who do not have Flash or those who use only IE. Navigation is a bit tricky - I found myself just going back to the main home page all the time by clicking the ASL PRO.com image on the top of the page. 
The only concern that I have is with the QuizMe! part of the site. This allows the user to be quizzed on signs in the EveryDay or Religious phrases categories. The user can pick how many words they wish to be quizzed on, but there is no way to otherwise choose a set of words - this picks from the entire category. This would be good for those who have used the entire site or who may be more advanced. 
There is another quiz area where students can pick to be quizzed on categories of signs such as animals, food, etc. This may be a more useful quiz area for instructors in lower level signing classes. 
Overall, I believe this will be a useful tool for students to learn new signs and review signs that they have learned. This may be useful as an additional resource for students in an ASL class, as a homework assignment, or for in-class practice.

I love being able to let students know if I'm going to be late because of a meeting I can't leave or absent because of illness.Technical Remarks:Limitations imposed by my mobile service provider make it necessary for me to use a workaround to text everyone, but the workaround is relatively easy to set up. The software author has provided a number of useful updates in the three years I've been using the app, and he provides good support materials and responds to questions quickly. There is now a new version of the app which should be even more useful, but since I have retired, I have not tried it out.",5

His essay is well-done, particularly since he offers readers (and fellow educators) his rationale for doing so and a how-to guide for online writing instruction.Technical Remarks:The structure of the article could have been more user-friendly and concise; it took time to navigate through the tabs to locate the desired information.",4
3623,Applet did not work on Netscape under Solaris.  Even if it worked it did not appear that it would be terribly useful.,1
3625,This is a great instructional design for a lesson.  This lesson combines the use of technology with cooperative group work.  In incorporates several types of technology with both Excel and power point involved.  The lesson also relates to the real world and a realistic situation that they could encounter in real life.  I think this scenarios for the project draw the students in so it is an engaging activity for them.  The collaboration between students is also excellent.  I would hope that tri-fold posters and brochures would not  be involved but sometimes it is also good to break from technology as well.  Technical Remarks:No problems with links etc.,4
3625,"This is a great lesson that incorporates the use of technology to accomplish an important life skill, budgeting and organizing one's finances. The lessons objectives are clear and the method and evaluations allow a teacher to teach and asses multiple skill levels.

The quizzes help make sure that you've learned what you need to.  There are good examples given within the lesson of what is correct, and what needs improvement.  This can help the students better understand what they can do in their own writing to spruce it up.  The visuals in the lesson are also functional - not only adding some color to the lesson but adding depth and perspective to the subject matter.  After this lesson, students having seen good and bad examples of writing, they should be better prepared for their essay assessment compared to a ""traditional"" lesson on essays.",5
3627,This is a neat project. Thanks for submitting.,5
3627,"I think you did a fantastic job covering the content. You used scaffolding well to build upon ideas from a paragraph to an essay. You incorporated the pictures and graphics in well. The humor was also a nice touch. I liked that students were offered the opportunity to study and review before moving on. You also worked well from defining a term to determining an example. The exercise for students to write their own paragraph was a great way to assess their understanding before you assign an essay. The only downfall for me is that I would consider using this with older students perhaps through ninth grade; however, the first slide is labeled for sixth grade. Even though they could benefit from it, some of my students might be insulted if I asked them to out the lesson and they read that. Overall, I think it will keep students attention, uses various instructional strategies and uses the technology well.  One thing that might be useful would be to offer a printable notes or defintion sheet although you could ask students to take notes as they went through the tutorial.  You may also want to include benchmarks.",5
3628,"Building vocabulary generates many benefits.  It directs students' toward a greater understanding of their reading skills, while building self-confidence.  Furthermore, the best way to develop and improve upon vocabulaty is to have a thesaurus in hand.

3629,"Great Idea incorporating research and creativity. Students will gain valuable knowledge about bullying and be able to reenact these situations and how to resolve problems in real life. If all educators were to do a bullying lesson, i'm sure it would make a great difference. ",4
3629,"Bullying is a huge issue, especially cyberbullying in this day and age. Students need to know the signs, symptoms, and how to handle situations anyways, so I think that integrating video editing and PowerPoint usage into a full-on project about bullying is a great idea. I really liked the video making aspect of this project. Learning how to create and edit audio/visual technology is a fantastic skill to posess and learning it at a young age makes students more comfortable with the technology alltogether. I think you really went in depth on what the students are going to need to know, which allows teachers to really analyze if their students are ready for a project of this magnitude. I also really like the group element of the project because it allows for collaboration and a hopefully more polished final product while teaching students the skill of working in a group with other people. Implementation of the METS standards was also nice because it gives us a more broad outlook on why this is a good lesson plan, which it absolutely is. One problem that I have is how are the students going to learn how to create, import, and edit the movie? There is no real mention of getting taught that element. Also it would be nice to have a few bullying resources provided on the lesson plan so teachers can get a head start in showing students some good resources. Overall I thought this was an excellent technology integration lesson plan, well done.",4
3629,"Great lesson!  Bullying is a very important topic to learn about today.  I like how you used content knowledge, pedagogy, and technology in your lesson.  The lesson opener is creative.  Kids learn so much from other kids and having the students watch their peers is a great way to use that as a tool.  Students will enjoy having individual responsibilities while contributing to and working as a team.  They will have a chance to research, write, collaborate, create a PowerPoint, and act out a video.  It would be really neat if the students were able to share their projects with other classes via the internet.  Maybe the students could do a live performance using Skype.  Another idea might be to put the videos on Utube and share them with friends, family, other classes, etc. and having them comment on each others, give constructive criticism and reflect on how this project has impacted their lives.  I look forward to trying this in my own classroom.  Technical Remarks:Everything looks great!",5
3630,"What a great idea!  I love the idea of students creating a fictious business.  I think it is very important for our students to understand what goes into having, running and establishing a profitable business.It had a variety of forums to relay the content.  It was organized, clear and proivded immediate feedback to the students.  I thought you did a great job providing multiple medias of representation and engagment.  I think that students would learn a great deal about business from this assignment. It is set up to encourage effort and persistence. Thank you for sharing this lesson.  ",5
3630,"I like the problem or need addressed in this lesson plan.  It is important for students to be more culturally informed.  I also like how the lesson has the students create something using real world examples.  The lesson also incorporates many choices for students and includes UDL principles like, closed captioning, text-to-speech, and foreign language translation.  Finally, I thought it also provided some cool instructional design in allowing students to collaborate and share using UniServity. Technical Remarks:It seems like you have everything covered.  Perhaps you may want to include more options for the students to demonstrate their understanding such as other presentation tools and podcasts.",5
3630,"This is a great project! You have covered all of the bases. It is in line with all of the UDL principals we learned about. Any student that has a need for learning will find a tool to help them learn the content. I like the way the students are simulating the business situation. They have to present it to the class as if they were the head of the company and they were advising their workers. The use of technology is appropriate for the assignment as the students have to research and create a presentation using technology.Technical Remarks:One thing that could help the students is to have the students do a role play for the actual interaction of the buisnesses. After learning about the culture through the presentation, a role play of an interaction would provide the students with a helpful insight to how a business meeting with another country might play out.",5
3631,I enjoyed the program.  Although you do have to download it to look at it.  It explained the C programming very well.  It gave very good examples of C commands.,5
3631,"Very good overall analysis of C programming commands and structure.  Must be downloaded and installed.  But for those students having trouble with computer programming structure, in any laguage, this is a good place to start.",4
3632,What a great resource! Students can always use more programming examples. Nice overview of the initial topics in C# in the console application mode.,5
3632,This site is a tutorial for programming using C# (sharp) as the language.  It does presume some knowledge of programming but is well structured with examples and images.  Links are easy to navigate and the back button returns you to the opening screen.  This site would be an excellent supplement to either a class in the language or someone who is self-taught.,5
3633,This site is an excellent tool to help teach an exploring careers curriculum for any grade level. The videos and exercises help to reach both visual and auditory learners.,5

3635,"First off I like how you made the teacher's information a seperate page at the start so students don't need to be bothered reading about the details.This is a great idea for students to practice their letter sounds!!! It first focuses on isolated vowel sounds then works on stretching the sounds in order to make words. There is also a review at the end for further practice. I was so bummed when the sounds didn't work on my computer :(Technical Remarks:I receive a ""codec unavailable"" rejection when I try to play the sounds.",4
3635,"The StAIR has very clean and crisp lines. The colors are soothing and the visiual images will reinforce the learning goals for the students. The common core standards were highlighted and addressed in this StAIR. The icon for teacher information was very useful. With struggling first graders and Kindergartners, I think the text that tells the student to go back and try another vowel may be too difficult to read without adult supervision. An audio clip of some of the directions would be great.Technical Remarks:I could not get the audio clips to work. I am using an older version of Powerpoint. Saving the show in the oldest supported version could mean that more people can experience the full effect of this great StAIR.",5
3635,"I am very impressed with this powerpoint tutorial designed for kindergarden and first grade students who need to practice listening for, identifying, isolating, and substituting medial vowel sounds in consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words.  The author uses wonderful visual examples that should appeal to the visual learner.  The use of audio examples is apparent throughout the slide show which will allow the learner to hear the vowel sounds with specific examples.  The use of audio will help those students who learn best by listening.  The combination of learning styles is apparent throughout this presentation.  I am also very impressed by the fact that this author used the common core standards when designing this presentation and lists what standards she is applying.  This presentation would be useful in the early elementary classrooms as well as very beneficial for reading specialists.Technical Remarks:The presentation is easily used by clicking on the mouse in order to go from slide to slide.  I like how clear options  are given for the learner so he or she can choose where to go next.  I also love her use of audio throughout this presentation.  The audio is clear and very easy to understand for early readers.",5
3635,"This is an interactive tool for use with younger students, or any student struggling to isolate vowel sounds. The presentation looks nice and is extremely interactive. The students are able to click on sound buttons to listen to the teacher model the sound. They can then practice discerning between the sounds until they master each vowel. Students are able to choose which letters to work on, allowing for ownership and choice. There are a few glitches with the sound. See the technical remarks.Technical Remarks:When I click the sound button on slide 6, it returns me to the short a page rather than playing the sound. This same thing happened on slides 13, 20, 27, and 34. Also, the sound buttons for the ""Stretch"", ""Swap"", and ""Review"" activities are visible, but I cannot click on them. This may cause confusion for such a young student.",4
3636,"The applet is enjoyable for both the instructor and students, and it is useful in a variety of mathematics and physics/physical science courses.

3637,"This is a simple and solid lesson plan. I like the way the teacher engages with the students and presents the problem, thus motivating them to learn how to properly use capital letters. It is a great idea to record the students reading their own book, thus increasing their interest and motivation.",4
3637,This lesson plan is designed to teach first grade students how to apply capitilization rules to their writing.  The setting for this lesson is much like story time and will appeal to 5-7 year old learners on that level.  Providing the students with a digital artifact of the lesson is an especially nice touch in that it is fun and will reinforce ownership of the learning.,4
3637,The focus of this lesson is to teach student appropriate use of capitalization. This is clearly stated in the section use to identify the problem or need for this lesson. The lesson has the students interacting and engaging in the material by use of interest. The students are interested in the back story of the book they will be creating. There is not a technology link that I can find. This lesson is self-explanatory and easy to follow. Would definitely apply to classroom setting for younger students or moderately impaired students.Technical Remarks:There were no technological links,4
3638,Requires paid log in account to view.,1
3639,I love these materials!  What a great way for students to learn about the Cascade Range and volcanism while constructing a nice product.,5
3640,This is one of the best sources for case based learning I have come across.  I have used the cases for Case discussions in class and for discussion boards. These cases would be very helpful to learners in an online course to master the content.,5
3641,Nice variety of case studies,5
3641,This site contains both cases and teaching methods for using cases in the classroom.  It should be categorized under multiple scientific disciplines and not just general science.  It is a tremendous resource.,5
3642,"Applet runs very well.  Quantitative information would have made it more versatile, however.",4
3643,this is an okay site it shows you how to form the cause and effect diagram. it was very easy to use but maybe needs a little more information included.,3
3644,I plan on stealing this from you.  It does explain the major causes of the first World war.  Technical Remarks:I would have liked to see something that gave the unit a clear ending.  I could see students looking at the screen and wondering what to do next.  ,5
3644,I like how you start off with multiple options and explains each one as the skides progress. I also like the mixed media and ending it on a lighter note.Technical Remarks:Some of the pictures overlap the text.,4
3645,A huge resource of accurate and timely information. There are news items on current outbreaks and general information on health and disease.,5
3646,Great lesson. I like that students can bring in their own favortie books.  That helps students make great text connections when they like the book.  I also like the use of the iPad.  I have used scribble press before and I really enjoy it and so do the students. ,4
3646,This was a great lesson on characters. I like the use of the Pearson Envision it! and the ipad app. I also like that you and the students use their favorite books. That could really foster excited readers! ,4
3647,"I loved this interactive page. Perfect to your description, this site is very suitable for children as well as younger learners who are interested or studying evolution. The pictures and information included are interesting easy enough to understand while still maintaining a high learning. ",5

3648,"I currently use OpenStax Chemistry for my General Chemistry Part I and Part II courses and overall I think OpenStax Chemistry is a good quality book for the price. OpenStax Chemistry does a good job in covering the material for both my courses. I do like the interactive portion of the iBook version of the book, which students can get for $5. The interactive portion is still accessible to students who use the pdf version by going on YouTube, where the interactive videos are sourced. The pdf version, majority of my students use, they have downloaded on their computer. I also upload the pdf version to their Blackboard as well, to make the book more accessible. There is a printed version, my campus bookstore offers, for $40.
OpenStax has allowed me to make my course more affordable to students. Due to the affordability, I know my students are more likely to download the book and use it as a resource for the course and refer back to it when they are stuck on a concept. 
OpenStax Chemistry is like any other Chemistry book. There is a table of contents, a glossary, citations, further references, as well as problems the students can use to practice. There is also a test bank for instructors, if you so wish to use their test bank. The graphics and animations they have are a nice addition that allows the book to be more interactive. 
So far, I have noticed a few errors in the book, which are being fixed with each new addition. One of the great aspects of using OpenStax: I am allowed to modify and re-arrange the chapters the way I am use to teaching my courses. I can also use other materials when I feel the book is lacking in the explanation of a concept. For example, the Born-Haber cycle, I had to modify from the version that was in the book due to severe typos. 
Overall, OpenStax Chemistry is a good book for my General Chemistry courses and with every new update the book keeps getting better and better. ",4
3649,"Contains good tutorial information. It is well-presented.Technical Remarks:The audio controller needs a ""Pause"" function so that it can be stopped and resumed. The end of the tutorial is supposed to pull up a 10-question quiz. This is not available.",4

3653,"Your review for using the Chinese tones was a good resource for students to use during the learning process. It is nice to have the audio there to help with the tones, and the videos towards the end are helpful as well. It would be nice to have some review if the students need more time with the materiall. I worked through the presentation and wanted to go back a step often to make sure I had the material right. Also, I agree that it just ended without any resoltuion of such. While I did learn some new material, I feel the presentation could benefit from a more in depth reveiw of the tones.Technical Remarks:The sounds worked for the most part. A couple of them did not seem to work on my computer. Also, linking out to YouTube with all of those videos was nice, but the constant back and forth between the presentation and YouTube was tedious.",4
3653,"Overall, a good resource for simple review of Chinese tones.  Technical Remarks:I really enjoyed getting the opportunity to learn another language!  You made the tones so clear when you related the tones to English exclamations.  I also really appreciated being able to hear the tones and see them visually.  It made me want to continue and see how much I could learn.  Unfortunately, when I came to the end, I was actually wondering if I did something wrong.  I looked for ways to go back and see if I missed something, but there was nothing.  I would have liked to have known that I was finished.  I also felt this review could have been longer and included more content.Though you have used the internet to publish your StAIR,  I do not feel you taken full advantage of today’s technologies for interactions within your presentation.  You have provided students with clear expectations, explanations, and audio, but you have not challenged or interacted with them in any way.  Also, checks for understanding are not built in to assess whether students are mastering the concepts being taught. I feel if you addressed those two things, you would have a great StAIR.   ",4
3653,Great addition to the MERLOT library!,5
3654,This is a very simple simulation but clearly shows the connection between different types of simple harmonic motion. Good short explanation.,5
3654,Good at showing the relationship between circular motion and that of a spring. Nice explanation section.Technical Remarks: Don't press play - it runs very fast. Instead press forward or backward.,4
3654,One of the better demonstrations of circular motion.,4
3655,Professionally accomplished animations.  Especially good at blood cell types and how to do counts. Good for introductory Hematology for Medical Technology training. Shows heart and lungs. Doesn't show circulation through the rest of the body.,4
3656,"This seems like a great resources for beggining teachers, especially if  you are at school where there are no existing resources that can be pulled from other science teachers. It seems ti be very interactive with material presented in different ways to appeal to the various styles of learning.",4
3656,I really liked how there was information from topics from all aspects of science. I could really use the information in this resource and pull it into my classroom. It could supplement the material in my text book,4
3657,"This is basically an archived online course that has been offered through by MITOpenCourseware. It includes a syllabus for a course on traditional Chinese literature and a basic description of term assessments. It doesn't offer learning modules or activities that can be immediately used in classroom or homework activities. It is most beneficial for instructors who are looking for a sample syllabus for a Chinese literature in translation course.  Many of the reading suggestions provided are primary materials in translation (excerpts from classic literary texts). It doesn't suggest readings that provide much in the way of cultural, literary or historical context. The syllabus puts the greatest emphasis on later imperial vernaculary literature. Consequently, it provides only one possible way of conceptualizing this kind of course.",3
3658,I like this website. It is well organized and has great information for marine lessons.,5
3659,This presentaton is great!  I love the demonstrations and the videos.  Very appropriate and helpful!  Very thought out and I hope to pass this on. :)Technical Remarks:Everything seemed to work properly and was easy to navigate through.,5
3659,"I think this STAIR is a wonderful resource for students. I liked that you elevated the vocabulary to reflect the ""clay"" lingo but also defined it more clearly in parentheses. I'm a nerd when it comes to fonts and appearance, and I loved the colors and various heading fonts you used throughout your presentation. Your STAIR also included a lot of useful information that was supported with images (great for visual learners!). Great job!Technical Remarks:As far as the flow of the presentation goes, I had some difficulty with the quiz section, and I clicked on incorrect answers, yet it allowed me to continue with the presentation. I'd just suggest going back and making sure the arrows are linked to the desired slide. Also, there were a few text boxes that needed to be extended in order to have all the text on one line.",5
3659,This is absolutely fantastic. The video examples are very easy to follow and students will easily understand all the concepts after going through this StAIR.,5
3660,"I am a student assigned to contribute a member comment.  I have spent about twenty minutes browsing Clouds and Precipitation.  I found the information to be educationally significant, as it follows NYS standards.  It was a fun way to introduce clouds that could be used with upper elementary and older students.  It gave a definition of clouds, told about the development, types and precipitation.  It was information that could be given on paper, however, the site provides useful links.    Technical Remarks: The site used was very easy to follow.  When I clicked the link I went directly to the information it said it would. The site also had an easy to follow directory on the left hand side and could be used for additional lessons on weather.    ",4

3663,"Instructors should use caution if they are using this app as a study of motion. It has several inaccuracies in both the description of the physics and in the output as it is running.Technical Remarks:In the introduction to the app, the following common physics misconceptions are reinforced:The app inaccurately describes the motion of the roller coaster as ""free fall"" when it is constant contact with the track.The app uses conservation of energy with no indication that this is neglecting all forms of friction and drag, a very drastic approximation for real roller coasters.The app identifies the potential energy as a property of the car rather than the results of the gravitational interaction between the car and the earth. Potential energy is the energy of an interacting system due to the configuration of the parts.The app defines acceleration as the change in speed, when it is the change in velocity. It incorrectly uses ""positive acceleration"" to mean acceleration in the direction of the velocity and ""negative acceleration"" to mean acceleration opposite to the velocity, a common confusion of many students.In the description of ""G-force"", the app described a positive g-force greater than 1 g as being when ""... you are being pushed into your seat..."", when it is the increase in the normal force of the seat on the rider. Although there are different approaches to handling non-inertial reference frames, this approach will confuse students regarding forces. This is no force pushing the rider into their seat other than gravity.While running the app, the graphs of velocity and acceleration, are not consistent in places. There are times when the velocity graph is a constant but the acceleration is not zero, and times when the velocity is increasing or decreasing linearly and the acceleration is not constant.When the car stops, the app describes the kinetic energy as being lost to ""heat energy"". Current best practices in physics education reserve the term ""heat"" for a very different purpose, the transfer of energy from one object to another due to a difference in temperature.",2

3665,"This seems like a great topic to complete the webquest on! Students will definitely benefit from the way that you have scaffolded the information to build their background. In the set of essential content, you ensure that they have the knowledge that they will need to really comprehend what they learn about the Colombian Exchange, but in order to have success you recognize the information they need to have. One question I have, do you expect a lot of variation in the students’ findings for them to present? It seems as though, if they are completing a webquest, their results should be similar given the specific web pages you mentioned. Also, you mention in your objective to have them evaluate their like or dislike with using the internet and resources for research, but I did not see an evaluation of this or a venue for them to give this input, will that be a part of their blog entry? Lastly, how will you assess them? Would you have a rubric for their blog post and will the students be aware of what should be included, or will you allow it to be more open ended and just a response? Overall, I think this is well thought out and your students would clearly benefit from practicing with technology to make learning more enjoyable about the Colombian Exchange.",3
3665,"Overall, I was impressed with the idea of the Columbian Exchange WebQuest.  As a fellow 5th grade teacher I know how hard that concept can be.  The students have a very difficult idea grasping the fact that things that are vital to our country today, were not here forever.  I really liked how the students would be using an 'outside source' to discover new ideas.  It allows students to feel a sense of discovery and ownership in their learning, which will create a more lasting learning experience.  Additionally, when students are working with rich websites, they are able to experience the material in a variety of ways.  A visual learner can be drawn in with the pictures and images, while a linguisitc learner can benefit greatly from the text provided.Especially valuable is the usage of a classroom blog for students to share their ideas.  This would allow students to create a collective knowledge of the content, which enhances overall understanding.The only part of the lesson I was unsure of were the websites that would be used.  In searching for my own class, I have found some sites that do a good job with the Columbian Exchange, however I am not sure if those are the ones the author was using.  The addition of the links to the desired sites would make this lesson that much more valuable.Again, I found this to be a good lesson idea, one that allow for student-directed learning and accomodated the needs of all the various learning types in a classroom.Technical Remarks:None",4
3666,"This material is well designed for helping math teachers in the district improve their understanding of the Common Core State Standards. As an introductory lesson, this material would be very helpful for math teachers to become more familiar with the Standards. The instructional objectives are clearly articulated, which contains several steps of understanding the Standards, ranging from definition of the Standards to their application to a real unit. The described essential content and the procedure are well suited for achieving the instructional objectives step by step. For instance, I think that the webcast provided by the author is a good example of delivering the content with multiple media, which might help the audience accomplish hands-on activities related to the topic. It would be better to provide clear and direct information or instructions about “designing a unit of study using the Standards” in the section of “an evaluation consisting of a test or observation.” For instance, you can specify what types of technology will be used, how the unit will be developed, what your expectations are, and so on. In general, this material has clear-cut objectives for the target audience and the content flow is quite reasonable for achieving the objectives.Technical Remarks:It seems that this material does not require much knowledge on technologies and high level of computer skills. I am pretty sure that if the participants have some basic computer skills, there will be no problem to go through this material. However, I think that there might be some ways to implement computer technology into the material more dynamic regardless of the participants’ proficiency levels in computer skills. For instance, the author mentioned group discussions from socialization perspectives throughout this material. It might be an alternative way to ask the groups to do their discussions using online chatting tools such as Skype, MSM Messenger, Google Buzz, or Vyew, take screenshots, and share them with other groups. Also, it might be good to ask the participants to create and keep e-portfolios using blogs or Google Sites throughout the process of designing and constructing a unit of study using the Standards.",4
3666,"Built to answer the real world need of creating awareness of the Common Core State Standards among Mathematics teachers.

3668,"WOW!  I want to do this lesson!  If I was an Art Teacher, I would definitely use this lesson!  I love how you integrated graphic examples, a screen cast and the rubric!  These are great tools for a student who might need a lesson repeated or for a home bound student.  This is a very exciting project for students and the tools used are FREE!  A great way to have interaction among students too!  Great Job!Technical Remarks:The screen cast seemed to cut out on me.  Not sure if this was intentional or a glitch.",5
3668,"This was a great lesson!  The need for allowing students to experience art through various mediums is essential, and I think it is a common occurrance that most schools are limited to a set of traditional mediums.  Integrating technology into the art classroom is a great and necessary step.  The photography and technology lesson has great real-life meaning to students as Lisa stated.  So many students are so well connected with each others' lives through social networking, and the vast majority connect through photos.  Tapping into this real-world activity of students fosters great motivation on the part of the child.  They are able to tie their own experiences and meaning to the new technology.  I also felt the scaffolded tasks on pixir.com was a great idea.  Students can experience the technology and learn it with an easier task, and build as they work through the assignments.  Offering students a choice in the thrid facet of this assignment is also important and allows students to take ownership of their work.Technical Remarks:Everything worked great!",5

Hi Mr. Omer, I explored the game in the website. Im teaching Iraqi dialect here at Fort Riley in Kansas. There are four computer labs for the Iraqi dialect. We have like two games in the tactical Iraqi dialect the first one is really hard game called arcade, and the other one is mission game which is very popular. The program is developed by University Of Southern California. The website is very interesting, and still Im working on it. I will recommend it to the army students to help them in their mission in Iraq. Please if there are any additional links about this issue, email it to me directly and that will help me a lot.
Thank you for the effort you put in this discussion board and have a nice day. 
Yours truly,

3669,"I am a Hebrew language teacher who has seen the difficulties students have learning the Iraqi dialect of Arabic. The difficulties native English speakers have include: reading right-to-left, making the unique guttural sounds of the language, and writing using a completely different set of characters. I read the an NPR article, Digital Culture, and it reminded me of another article I had read 2-3 years ago about project Babylon that attempted to simultaneously translate the Afghan languages for the American soldiers in the field via a microphone and a hand held device.  Unlike the Afghan attempt, which was an unsuccessful solution to the language barrier, this Iraqi one seems to be more effective because instead of presenting words in isolation it provides global language in context.  The game turns out to be a useful ""crash course"" for the troops in the combat zone.  Basically the game uses the popular point-and-shoot format which is dynamic and holds the students' attention.",4

3675,Excellent selection of sites; very clearly organized and presented. Some sites are classic ones for French Studies; others are less known but just as useful.,4
3676,"What a great topic and delivery of the material.  This presentation is an excellent use of UDL; truly shows students material in a way that reaches everybody.  The idea of bringing real world scenarios into the lesson is a great way to get our students thinking about their conduct beyond the social media that they are using.  The quote of statistics for job searches and being turned down allows students to look toward their future and how their behaviour may affect their job prospects.  I liked the immediate feedback offered as I navigated through the site and enjoyed the encouragement of ""try again"" or ""great job"".  I would suggest a short tutorial on some of terms used prior to asking to take the quiz, for example: ""what are not social media"" (some people may not be famiiar with all of the listed items and there was not a definition slide explaining each one).  This presentation would be a great tool to use at the beginning of the school year (prior to computer lab).Technical Remarks:I was unable to use the slide asking me to click on the exmaples at different levels of school and this disallowed me to complete your presentation.",4
3676,"This presentation (StAIR) is a great source of information about forming positive digital footprints.  Overall the show is clear and well-written.  It does depend heavily on reading, but each student is able to move through the presentation at his/her own pace.  Students must answer some questions applying the material which they read.  Immediate feedback for each question is given.  By incorporating information about popular social networking sites, there is great potential for grabbing student interest.  The information provided about the active digital footprint was just enough to peak my interest.  I would have liked to see more!Technical Remarks:I'm not sure if I was supposed to click on something on the last page, or if the three options were intended to be teacher-guided classroom discussions.  This, perhaps, could be clarified and/or changed.",4
3676,"I thought the show was very informative.  It could be used as a presentation with some interaction of students.  I liked that it gave some data about how employers and colleges look at social media to see what prospective students/employees do in their free time.  It applied the social media outlets that students use on a daily basis to real life scenarios, and hopefully that would motivate students to learn how their choices about what information they share on the internet impact their futures.  The show is an example of an UDL because it created a new way for students to interact with the information, and it allowed students to navigate through the show at their own pace.  It gave direct feedback with questions, so students would know immediately if they had understood a concept or not.Technical Remarks:The last page I saw said to click on scenarios to see how creating an active footprint would work.  These did not work for me; I'm not sure if it's because I'm on a Mac or not.  This show would be great to use with a smartboard or mimeo board because students could come up and interact with the presentation.",4
3677,"This provides a good overview (or quick review) of what to include in a writing assignment.  I do like students to choose their own audience, but I think that they often automatically default to ""instructor""; so the reminder to contextualize for and with them is helpful.",4

3680,"I think the presentation of the material was eye catching and would keep student interest. I think this would be a great review or introductory activity.  The presentation was easy to use, and flowed nicely.  If used as an introductory activity, I think breaking into smaller portions overall would be beneficial.  It is a lot of content to remember in one class period.  If this was used a review activity, I think it would be much more doable the way it is presented.I would like to use this in the fall with my new group of students, to see how they respond.The only real recommendation I would have for this presentation is that I would try to find videos showing the movement vs. still pictures.  I feel students would remember the boundaries easier.Overall, good concept to tackle, and dead on for MI benchmarks.",4
3681,"I believe that an understanding of different cultures is an essential quality of the xxi century student and professional. We live in an increasing globalized world; these types of activities are definitely relevant in today’s education.

3690,"This resource contains useful readings and multimedia materials that offer historical background for the Renaissance and critical approaches to specific texts. The site provides a framework for teaching a course with four major units organized according to genre. While it excels in curating secondary materials, the abundance of these can potentially overwhelm a focus on primary texts. The title of the course, ""Cultural and Literary Expression in the English Renaissance,"" is an accurate representation of its curated content: it's about the period, and students will experience its poetry, drama, and prose in an extremely mediated manner. ",4

Assessments came at great intervals, which keeps the student from forgetting or feeling overwhelmed. I also like that when a wrong answer is clicked the student is redirected to the content for review.I think one thing that may help this StAIR is to have audio, perhaps optional audio. Technical Remarks:I noticed just two technical problems:The animations on slide 18 did not play. So I had to leave the presentation in order to move on, and I missed that content.The email activity, where the user clicks on each email and is given a reason to open or not, looped and I had to leave the presentation and reenter at the next slide. Those are all the problems I noticed!",5

Perhaps for those who have just gotten into the field of science, this web site is completely helpful to understand the basic concepts of science and put them in practice. There is a lack of explanation about some more concepts relating to the main topic. However, it does a good gob as an interactive site. Technical Remarks: It is a really easy program to use. I did not need any assistance or outside support to use the material successfully. However, it is too simple. I think it needs some more animation, more icons or navigational features. ",2

There should be more to the site like for instance; other visual keys to see how the eye itself works, explain exactly what is going on when you look at the spinner. Technical Remarks: The site was easy to get to and navigate through, but some software is required in order to see some of the material.

It has a huge number of links to many things such as free English courses, quizzes, teaching English, lesson plans, grammar, vocabulary, etc. English listening skills and the activities related to listening are the main topics of this website. The best thing about this site is that the study materials are divided into three levels: beginners, intermediate and advanced. This means whoever interested in learning English will find something suitable for his/her level. The number of activities is just huge.

This website is very especially useful for teachers of English as a second or a foreign language and also very useful for the students as well, especially if they are non-native speakers. It helps them improve their listening and pronunciation skills and helps build vocabulary. The teachers can use for designating homework for their students. It can also be used for tests preparation. There is also a link for minimizing the English accent of non-native speakers. Another one is for how to listen and pay attention, which I think is something very useful for non-native speakers who are able to read and write well, but they do not understand when native speakers talk to them.Technical Remarks:The site is very useable, very simple and really organized. You can spend hours and hours and never get bored. It also has links to other useful websites. I think it is a place that any non-native speaker of English must visit. The recorded materials are very clear and very easy to play. Also you can move back and forth very easily and very smoothly. Give it a try and I am sure you will like it very much and you will keep visiting it.",4
3697,"DIDASKALIA is a long-standing, high-quality, accessible collection of essays, reviews, and other information about Ancient theatre styles (primarily Greek and Roman) and their contemporary performances.The online journal has been in existence since 1994, and all issues and articles are available online.  It has not published constantly over that time, with a large gap between 1997 and 2001, and again between 2002 and 2004, 2007 and 2009, and 2009 and 2011.  With the issue numbered ""8"" in 2011, a new, single issue, pdf format begins, and seems to have become annual (there are 2011 and 2012 issues in this format, and the 2012 issue is listed as ""current."")Many articles are potentially useful for the theatre history classroom or the individual theatre history student.  Most useful is the search feature, which allows you to search the titles for any keyword (playwright, character, title, theme, etc.)I was first introduced to this site / journal when I was in graduate school in the 90s, and it is good to see that it is still accessible and adapting to new technologies.",5
3697,"Probably deserves at least a 3.5 The material on the site is good.
The site is an online journal that addresses issues relevant to the contemporary performance of ancient drama. The journal appears occasionally, currently 6 multi-issue volumes since 1994. Contributions vary from reports on productions to more scholarly essays.
The site also includes a ""study area"" with a good introduction to ancient stagecraft and theaters, as well as listings of performances, workshops, conferences, etc. This part of the site is current.Technical Remarks:I encountered no technical problems. Links to outside sites open in the same window; they do not open in a new tab or window.",3
3698,Excellent lesson plan! The idea of using Teen Wolf to provide students with different forms of irony will certainly engage them.  Seeing Michael J. Fox in his younger years should be an interesting topic for your students.  I really like the idea of allowing the students to choose the format for how they present the different types of irony.  I imagine that this is a fun lesson for you assess as they present their ironic examples.  Well done!Technical Remarks:professional looking document,5
3698,"Author’s decision to motivate students through the use of choice in product creation and ability to collaborate with peers promotes a positive learning environment. Instructional objectives are clearly stated and include higher order thinking skills. Including these types of skills helps students develop a deeper understanding of the topic being covered. Lesson addresses a variety of learning styles including visual, kinesthetic, and auditory in providing examples, lesson delivery, and choice of student product to create. I also think showing movie clips to activate and connect to student’s prior knowledge is an excellent idea. Providing students the opportunity to collaborate with their peers is engaging and should help facilitate creativity in their final products. It would be nice to see the web-based tools serve a more central role in the assignment. For example, have students brainstorm their ideas in Google Docs, create a rough sketch of their presentation in Google presentation, and finally use a recording device to capture and share their final project with the class. I also think it would be very beneficial to include a rubric or guideline sheet for students to follow as they are completing this assignment. Overall, this lesson is a very engaging and creative way for students to demonstrate their understanding of the 3 types of irony in literature.Technical Remarks:Was able to easily open material, easy to read font.",4
3699,"I've always been a huge fan of the BBC and this on-line resource is particularly impressive.  Though there is some bias in the reporting, it pales compared to what we find in the US news sources.  Pairing the two when teaching modern events is quite useful (and enlightening).  In addition, for humanities instruction the interviews of writers and artists is extensive (and you don't have to wade through anything about Pitt/Jolie to find them).  This site is terrific for both personal and educational use.Technical Remarks:You have to download real player, which depending on your system can be a pain.",5

The website links to useful related websites, and sites a number of publications, although that page needs to be updated. The site is easy to use, and the links work. Its potential as a teaching and learning tool is best used as a reference resource to introduce the concept of digital citizenship. Students can explore the linked resources, and share their findings. The target audience appears to be classroom teachers. It should be noted that Mike Ribble is well known in this field, and presents and publishes regularly in this area.",4
3700,The 9 elements are great.,5
3701,Your presentation added a fun twist for students to explore the concepts of weathering.  I can see 6th grade geography classes also a foucs for your StAIR.  The concepts you cover within your presentation are ones that students struggle with on occasion and your project allows for an independent student review when needed.  Technical Remarks:You did a nice job adding additional resources for exploration throughout the presentation.  I thought the UDL principles were sufficiently met along with the addition of  quizzes to support learning.  There were no problems with any of the links but I do worry about opening up the web through additional links with young students.  ,4
3701,"I really enjoyed this resource. The powerpoint gives a variety of types of media such as articles, videos, and pictures. There are fun transitions that would make the powerpoint more exciting. I also was impressed by the actions linked to the words on the quizzes.",5
3701,"This is a great resource when teaching about changes in the Earth's surface. I appreciate that the objectives for this resource are listed at the beginning.  I like that the feedback for each question is on the same page instead of going to a new page. This resource includes links to videos, games, and more information, as well as colorful diagrams and pictures. I do worry about some of the transitions between pages and how the words fly on the screen. I know some of my students will be distracted by those.Technical Remarks:PowerPoint",4
3702,An excellent tool for teaching and learning about the connections between man and the Earth. It is very well organized and interactive.,5
3703,Great animation of how earthquake waves move through the earth.  A very clear explaination accompanies the site.Technical Remarks:The actual animation is a little small though and one may want to turn down the resolution on their computers.,5
3704,"Wow, this resource has great information for learners.  The slides were very interesting with the different pictures of real scenes.  Additionally, when the learner got an answer incorrect they were taken back to the information where they could review and find the correct answer.  The only suggestion I have is to maybe add some sound to the slides where the information is read to the learner in case the student is visually impaired or the learner's reading level is lower than the words presented on the slides. Overall, great STAIR!!Technical Remarks:Minimal technology requirements so many people can easily use. All links worked as well.",5
3704,"This StAIR resource is great! There are interesting graphics, a you-tube video, and many animated features that are engaging and educational for the students that are working through this project. This project covers a lot of material, but with the graphics, and teaching slides it isn’t overwhelming to the learner. Each different component of an earthquake is clearly illustrated, as well as the parts of the Earth that play a role in earthquakes. I like that there is additional material for the students to work through once they finish with this slide show also.Technical Remarks:The only difficulty I had was when the presentation was playing and I clicked on the you-tube video, the video starting playing behind the presentation. I had to escape out of the presentation, and then resume the slide show from the current slide once the video was completed. I am not sure what technological experience the kids that are working with this will have, and if they will run into trouble navigating between the two components.",5
3704,"What a great lesson!  The diagrams and photos are helpful for reinforcing learning objectives.  I particularly like how the presentation is broken into two sections: a review of the earth and its structural components and an overview of what earthquakes are, where they can take place, and the different types of earthquakes.  During the quiz sections, I found it extremely helpful that you had a review button for questions that may have been missed.  They helped to reinforce the concept being taught.  The embedded video was amazing!  What an excellent find.  The external links that explained the three types of earthquakes was helpful as well.  I liked how it actually showed how types of faults move.  The presentation is technical without bogging students down with too much information.  They will enjoy learning about this powerful, unpredictable force of nature.  With the recent earthquakes in Haiti, New Zealand, and Japan, this lesson will help students gain a better understanding of the devastation earthquakes can cause.Technical Remarks:The yellow ""proceed"" button is a nice touch.  It is eye-catching and links to the next pages.  I would suggest changing the color of the subtitle on the first slide because the black type is a little tricky to distinguish with the great picture in the background.  Also, perhaps a ""back"" button on the informative slides would give students a chance to review before taking the test.  Overall, outstanding!",5
3705,"I liked this website because it tells us about recent earthquakes around the world.  On the maps, you can click on a location and it will give you a description about the earthquake.  Great information for childrenTechnical Remarks:Very easy to navigate through",4

3706,I really enjoyed the material they use.,4
3707,Includes 58 different types of sources. Technical Remarks:HTML/Text,5
3708,I really like this lesson for integrating language into the everyday items. Language can be very difficult to make meaningful. I also appreciate how this combines language and healthy eating. It encourages students to try new things in a very different way. Especially for middle school students who don't always like to eat healthy things. Technical Remarks:There is a link that does not work on the lesson plan.,4
3708,"    This is a great lesson that teaches the French language in an interesitng way.  I like the idea of using Twitter as a class discussion to allow those shy students the chance to interact without having to speak in class.  I like that while teaching French, the students are also learning about nutrition.  I like the hands-on approach by presenting the items in real life while discussing them.  This lesson encompasses various teaching and learning strategies like socialization, group work, individual work, written work and sharing.  This lesson meets the needs of various learning styles.Technical Remarks:The link to the handout does not work.For the assessment portion, allowing the students to pick from a variety of presentation ideas might increase their interest by allowing them to express themselves and demonstrate what they know in a way that they are most confident in.",5
3708,"I have taught both these subjects about color and food in separate contexts and in different French levels.  The  content  covering  color vocabulary   and expressing  likes and dislikes  in French   in appropriate  for  FRENCH 1 LEVEL I A (meaning first semester of French) whereas food( fruits and vegetables)  related vocabulary, grammar  (the French verbs  to eat, to buy, good eating habits) are appropriate for the  FRENCH 1B (meaning second semester of French).  What interactive activity can be offered for students to speak or write exclusively in French and post on blog?Technical Remarks:No technical difficulties",3

I am particularly interested n quizzes because it is so time consuming to create the right type of quiz that is not going to be just a simple vocab quiz, but more an assesment tool. The searching of the site is also quite simple and I was able to find already couple of activities for my Italian classes.

This site provides a plethora of materials concerning Chaucer, Middle English, The Canterbury Tales, and the time period.  The site offers a wealth of resources; it becomes a one-stop site.  Students are exposed to a variety of aspects Chaucer.  As many schools are trying to meet the demands of budget cuts, this site provides access to The Canterbury Tales online.  Technical Remarks: Students found it easy to navigate through the site.  Some students prefer reading materials on a computer as opposed to a text book.  I did experience some technical difficulties.  Under Other On-line Chaucer Sites, the Alan Baragonas Chaucer Page was not available.  The New Chaucer Society Home Page would not allow me to return back from there.  I do realize that it is impossible to maintain links to other sites.",5
3718,"Quality of Content: The quality of the content of the StAIR elapsed time is valid. This is an objective that students will need to demonstrate in every grade level and this StAIR would be especially beneficial to lower elementary grades. The activity allows students to practice with elapsed time problems. They can also watch a tutorial video on You Tube to learn a strategy for solving elapsed time problems.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching-Learning Tool: This PowerPoint presentation could be best used in both the practice and application stage of the learning cycle.  It is geared toward students who have background knowledge with telling time on an analog clock and also with skip counting by fives. There are plenty of opportunities for students to practice elapsed time with a few reviews of key concepts.  The tool also provides prompts to help students understand the value of understanding how to calculate elapsed time by giving them real world applications to process through.   Once students have demonstrated mastery with elapsed time they will be able to apply the skill to situations beyond the classroom.  The tool is very user friendly and definitely supplements the educational objective and classroom curriculum.  The format is engaging and the comments to the students are affirming and encouraging.  The teaching and learning goals are clear and easy to identify.Ease of Use: The general layout of the Power Point is consistent and aesthetically pleasing.  Young students will not lose interest in the practice problems.  The format is well laid out with clear and easy to read text.  It also has buttons to navigate back and forth in the presentation as well as a home button on each slide for students to use if they need to return to the beginning of the presentation. The user of this tool should not get trapped in the lesson because he/she can move forward in the presentation if they choose the correct answer or they can repeat the item if they chose an incorrect answer.  There are clear explanations for all answers that students can choose.  What I liked most about this tool was that the incorrect answers all provide an explanation for the common misconceptions.  This allows the user to see where he/she made a mistake, whether it was a mistake with a concept or a computation. The user can also discover new strategies for the skill from the You Tube video.  The PowerPoint does not require additional support or documentation for the user to be successful.  The slides are all working and the link to the You Tube video is functioning.  The material in the presentation is aligned to the same visuals (clocks) that students are familiar with.  The PowerPoint design is engaging for students because of the clear and non-busy format.  The user will find this presentation fun because of the variety of visual and auditory components.Suggestions: This is a great resource! The only suggestion I could offer is to modify the page with the You Tube link. The directions tell the student to start the video clip by clicking on the star button but there is no star button, only a camera button.  Also, perhaps adding audio with the text read aloud for the PowerPoint. This would support any students who not proficient readers.",5
3718,"Quality of Content: Provided is a STAIR activity for students to practice elapsed time. Students are able to practice a variety of elapsed time problems and also watch a youtube video modeling how to solve elapsed time problems. This is a great reinforcement and practice of an important concept for students to grasp in second/third grade.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching-Learning Tool: This STAIR would be beneficial to use as a reinforcement tool and/or drill practice of elapsed time.  Students need to have a basic understanding of telling time before learning about elapsed time.  This would be a great tool for students to use to apply the curriculum to “real-life” problems.  After using this material, students should have a greater understanding of how to solve elapsed time problems and strategies to do so.Ease of Use: This STAIR is very easy to use.  Students are asked an elapsed time question and if they answer correctly they move to the next question.  If they answer incorrectly a helpful hint is provided for each wrong answer that addresses why the student possibly chose that answer.  Students click a return arrow to try the question again or, if answered correctly, click a forward arrow to move on.",4

I like the screen cast that you also included. All of your buttons worked and I like that you had a home button that would take the learner back to the beginning. UDL principles: I like how you integrated audible and visual learning into your stair. Your stair also used different strategies to teach the lesson, you told ht students about the topic but also showed them in a screen cast.

3727,"This is an incredibly useful lesson. In today's world of email and texting students tend to blur the lines between formal and informal. Teaching students how to write a proper email to a professor (or really any professional) is an extremely valuable skill. The lesson walks through ideas on how to teach this skill.If the instructional design incorporated more detail on exactly what students will be asked to do (example: sample assignment with rubric) it will become more accessible for educators to use. When it comes to evaluation it is stated that students will be working together to revise their emails, however, the role of the teacher is not directly addressed, this is why a rubric might come in handy.It would be beneficial for there to be an activity incorporated with a rubric. In addition it would be more pedagogically sound if examples of good/bad emails were provided for students to dissect (this could be adapted to be done in class with just discussion or done using some sort of on-line discussion forum). This lesson could easily be transformed into a Webquest format with more detail on instructional procedure and more direction provided for students. It says that it will be given in Moodle but it is not clear on what that will look like (provide a link if it is already created in Moodle).Technical Remarks:The technology component can easily be adapted to any email service that students are using. Perhaps it would be a good idea to incorporate an overview lesson of how to use different features of the email service before beginning the email writing piece.There is a colaborative component where students will be commenting on each other's emails (this could be adapted to be done in class with just discussion or done using some sort of on-line discussion forum).

3729,Its good to see the idea of accessibility is not being limited to the Internet. Too often people forget about simple every day technologies that have to be modified to become accessible to many people.

3762,"First, I have to comment on all the linkages to standards... very much appreciated!  Very good!  I like the focus of the assignment.  It's something that is realistic and sends a strong message to students about their agency in society.  The interactive components are the strength of this assignment; allowing students to talk to each other as well as citizens through their blog posts will really help create understanding.One concern would be the level of technology it is necessary for students to know how to navigate.  You might consider building in some tutorials online or in some othe format, in case students need help starting up their blog or working with zoho, diigo, or other services.  I see that there are work days scheduled and days for ""logistics;"" maybe that type of work is included here.Overall, great job!Technical Remarks:As mentioned above, there is a lot of technology skills that students may be learning and not be quite comfortable with yet... other than that, everything looks great!",5
3763,"I found the material very effective in what it was trying to accomplish. I used the applet to solve the question asked at the bottom and found the equation simple and easy to understand. Using the formula provided, I'm sure it would not be difficult for one to teach this concept.Technical Remarks:assuming that L base of n is common knowledge among the students and they know how to solve using them of course.",4
3764,"This is a fantastic website for whoever interesting to collect and use sound files as sound background in PowerPoint for fun and for educational purposes. You have the option to search by file format, and number of channels: mono and stereo. These files are very small; and the maximum size is 2 MB.",5
3764,This is an excellent site for finding authentic sounds. I have personally used this site to add realistic sounds to classroom material. The only caution that I would add would be to check the copyright status of the sounds before publish anything with the sounds in it.,4
3765,"This Force and Motion lesson plan allows students to use a variety of technology. First, students use Fossweb to create a rollercoaster design and will quickly see they need enough downward force for the ball to continue moving through the track.  This is a very appropriate activity for first graders, and works well as an introductory activity. Students then make predictions about objects through a guided activity. Finally, students are able to apply their knowledge by finding examples of force and motion and then create a glogster presentation.  The ""Blow & Go"" guided prediction activity includes a chart to guide information processing.  This activity is also flexible in its ability to vary levels of challenge as students create their glogster presentation.Technical Remarks:This lesson can only be accessed through Netfiles.",4
3765,"This is a wonderful lesson to use for first grade science.  Inductive teaching strategies are used, as the students must generate their own conclusions concerning force and motion through various experiments. Background knowledge is activated and applied to the lesson, and relationships between force and motion are discovered by the students. This lesson provides for many opportunities to use technology as well. Students are able to not only interact with materials, but also may complete an interactive lab. To further promote collaboration and self-reflection, Glogster is used for the students to record their findings and conclusions. This is a wonderful tool that will give students the opportunity to reflect on their findings while also asking and answering questions of other students. The students are rewarded with the opportunity to build an online rollercoaster, which will further push their thinking about force and motion. Through publishing to Glogster, students will become motivated to work together to record their findings, and will allow parents to view the work of students. Upon assessment, a rubric may be included for the Glogster project. Will each student receive the same grade if they are collaborating? How will you know who contributed what to the poster? I would not hesitate to use this lesson plan for my own classroom, and it can also be adapted to meet the Michigan Grade Level Content Expectations for third grade.Technical Remarks:Upon downloading this lesson plan, viewers are required to sign in through M.S.U. Netfiles. If the viewer does not have access, he/she will not be able to view the lesson plan.  When viewing the lesson through Adobe, it is not possible to view the Aims Blow and Go lab. All other links have been tested and are currently working.",4
3766,Great job on the STAIR.  I think this is something I could make use of the next time I am teaching a physical education class.  Great job.,5
3766,"UDL guidlines are well represented.  The appearance is colorful but not overbearing, and the use of different size, color and type of font is attractive.   I like the way you added some comedy, music and sound effects.  Additionally, there are multiple means of representation as there are not only slides but also web links from a hospital and a physical therapy organization  and a link for a worksheet.  The only thing that may be missing is the possiblity for students to hear what has been written.Technical Remarks:The lesson is easy to navigate through and there are no problems with the links or action buttons. Also, the timing of everything is great!  Well done.",5
3767,"I really enjoyed the content of this StAIR.  However, I think there should be a little more directions on some of the slides.  Some slides had spots to click so the students would know where to go however there were some, like the answer pages that didn't have any arrows.  Students could get lost in the powerpoint if they are unsure of where to go next.",3
3767,This is a great stand alone project for students who are on level in reading. Adding audio would also include the students who are below level. I believe students may get confused about what and where to click in the slide.  I was confused about where to click. I clicked on the red words and the slide chages. I went back to get back to the slide and started over.Technical Remarks:All links worked.,3
3768,I like this site because it gives practical phrases for the traveler to any country.  It gives a quiz for each section of language learned. It provides the viewer with feedback on the right answers.It does not give any pronounciations though.  This site gives the viewer reading knowledge only.I would use this with my students in my Technical Report Writing (ENG 131) course when we do a unit on international communication and travel.Technical Remarks: The site is easy to navigate.  ,5
3769,Great material that is delivered in a user friendly format.,4
3769,I have used a lot of these exercises for my beginning CAD students at the High School level as a supplement to my textbook. I love how easy they are to use.,4
3770,"This lesson does a great job following the TPACK model.  Technology- students need to use PowerPoint to create stories and be able to embed their voices.  I love the idea of students recording their voices reading their stories! Pedagogy- this lesson allows students to activate prior knowledge and recycle material from previous lessons.  It uses scaffolding and group work.  Content- students will be focusing on using direct and indirect object pronouns in an authentic way, creating a book that the learner will feel it is meaningful and useful. An idea of something you could add would be having your students read the stories to an elementary school in your district (perhaps if there is one that teaches French) or they could send their stories to a French school! Technical Remarks:Uses:PowerPointEmbedding voices",4
3771,Great to develop oral skills and reinforce vocabulary outside of the classroom as a self assessment.Technical Remarks:Video with good sound - it's easy to work with this material,5
3772,"On Netscape under Windows NT the applet ran a little better, although it doesn't seem to be very versatile.",3
3773,Very entertaining material at this site. Good information and easy to read.,4
3774,I have used this website as a reward for my students.  The kids really love the games!  I've always been impressed by how original the games are.,5

3776,"Ismaeil, I liked this site. However, I did find one aspect of the game that I feel could cause some confusion for players. I played at the easy level and immediately got one answer wrong. I was surprised, because I picked the right word, but spelled it incorrectly. The word was teim. I wrote item for the correct spelling, but the correct answer was time. I kept playing and had a similar encounter with trie. I spelled tire, but the correct answer was tree. It appears that the game only allows for one answer. The game might make for better playing if it allowed multiple answers.",3
3776,"Merlot  Games that Teach
http://www.funbrain.com/spell/index.html
This website is a great educational website, especially for developing spelling skills. It is very useful and very helpful for young kids and it can also be used by non-native speakers of English.
How to play the game:
	The computer will give you twenty sets of four words.
	Place a check next to the word, which is spelled wrong.
	Spell the word, which you checked, correctly in the box.
	If you get all twenty problems correct, you can put your name on the websites leader board.
The player has a chance to choose between an easy and a hard level. The easy level has easy and short words, while the hard level has long and hard words. After following the steps of playing the game, the player has to click on check it! to receive feedback and scores. The same thing will happen with each of the twenty words.

The website has other games related to math, reading, etc. The one that deals with the spelling is the one that I liked the most. Because the site is originally designed for kids, it is very easy to use there is no complication at all. The number of the links is very limited and when you click on anyone of them, it smoothly takes you to the right place.

I think primary school teachers can use this website to develop the spelling skills of their students. As we all know spelling is not an interesting topic to deal with, but this game makes it very interesting and great fun. Teachers of English as a second/foreign language can also use this game to develop the spelling skills of their students.Technical Remarks:At the bottom of the website there are very useful links for parents, teachers, etc. Technically, there are no problems regarding navigating this website or playing the spelling game. In addition, the best thing about this game is that it is free. You do not need to pay any fees for playing the game or using the website.",4
3777,"This article from the UK briefly defines anime and manga, largely from a GLBT perspective with a cultural context. It draws upon creators and fans of the genre, and makes some interesting comments.",2
3778,Good information about grammatical points to improve  students' writing skills.  Students can benefit by this reading.,4
3779,"I think this is an excellent site with some useful information.  I found the set of pronunciation exercises clear and carefully stepped for ease of student use. I can see pulling up this site and letting students listen to the first 20 lines of the ?Prologue? as a way of introducing The Canterbury Tales in my British Literature course.  And this is only one of the tutorials offered to students to make them comfortable with Chaucer?s pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is also a ?Teach Yourself? Chaucer section that not only provides support for Middle English grammatical patterns and vocabulary, but includes several tales to work on, including quizzes to take at completion. The bibliographic information is rich as well.Technical Remarks: Everything worked for me, including the pronunciation exercises that I tried.  I especially like the links to other information, all of which (of those I tried) worked and were worth investigating.  ",5
3779,"I didn't get passed the link that provided pronunciations of Middle English vowels, dipthongs, and consonants in isolated words and in example sentences from Chaucer, though there are links to other kinds of information.  I got hung up in the sounds of Middle English.Technical Remarks: On the pronunciation pages, the technology assumed is how to operate an audio tape player.  Click on the facsimile arrow, and the word or sentence is said (double arrow for fast forward or rewind).  Quite transparent for anyone who has ever used a cassette player.",5
3780,"A concise and appealing lesson and format for educating students on these basic geometric terms. The theme is pleasing to the eye. In addition, the applause and animated star for correct answers will appeal to students at the targeted grade level. The author does a great job of keeping the slides simple with to-the-point descriptions that are easy to understand. A recorded reading of the questions would make the presentation more accessible to all students no matter the reading level or first language.The presentation could be improved by providing more feedback to the learner if they choose an incorrect response. Currently, the presentation just directs the student back to the description slide with no feedback. Direct feedback that is connected to the specific incorrect choice the student made would greatly improve the presentation. For example, if the question asks the student to choose which is a ray and the student chooses a line, a slide could explain the difference between the two and then direct the student back to the question. In addition, the Internet could be utilized as an extension for further information or as a review (links could be inserted to take the reader to a website).Technical Remarks:All in working order.",4
3780,"Positive Feedback: Clean, crisp slide designs. Slide design was very consistent throughout presentation. Slides contained good information, without too much text on one slide. Presentation provided quiz questions and feedback, immediately after covering a concept. Presentation was set up in a linear fashion with little to no possibility of getting lost while navigating through. By slide going back to concept when you clicked on the wrong answer it did a good job of not demoralizing a student for not getting the correct answer.Critical Feedback: The slideshow allowed little to no choice in which concept a student would cover. The wrong answer takes the student back to the concept, but does not actually give feedback as to the fact that they got the question wrong. Feedback for right answers was positive and consistent, but also repetitive and somewhat mundane. Three out of the five answers on the multiple choice were “C.” More variance in correct answers would probably be more authentic. When a student gets an answer wrong on the quiz it takes the student all the way back to review that element, with no choice to go directly back to the quiz after reviewing. A recorded reading of concepts to go along with the text would add to the accessibility and of this lesson and help to follow UDL principles. The slides contain only mathematical based images, and should include “real world” examples like a picture of the top of a door for line segment, a picture of two streets running parallel on a map, and a picture of a laser pointer, etc. These again would help relate this lesson and would follow UDL principles. Also, this lesson could include foreign language equivalents, especially of basic terminology like lines, etc. This would seem appropriate for a common language like Spanish.Technical Remarks:All technical aspects that were created seemed to work well.  Above comments address aspects that could be more detailed and further developed.",4
3781,"The material is a creative commons licensed introductory textbook. It is well organized as a logical introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) through a progression of chapters: Introduction, Input, Map Processing, Data Processing, Analysis and Output.  
The content achieves good compromise between the cursory introduction to basics that is done in ESRI Tutorial books and the overly technical onslaught presented in many expensive GIS textbooks.  
The only down side is that I had a hard time reading the material in a web browser and the graphics were hard for me to see. They certainly achieved their purpose, but I was distracted by the blurry text in images. The pdf version (available from the Acrobat link icon at the bottom right of each chapter) is easier to read but the graphics are still fuzzy.  
I am considering integrating this content in to our Introduction to GIS course. I will use it as source material to be parsed out in to our existing weekly instructional modules. Thank you for sharing!  ",4
3782,"This stand alone assignment is an awesome resource.  It is informative and involves students without being boring, which is saying a lot, considering the lesson is about citing sources!  I especially liked the clean layout, no clutter to distract.  This would be a great resource to use to introduce students to the importance of citing sources, and how to use MLA citation.  The only issue I noticed with this StAIR is that the in text citations are shown as having commas with them, for example ""Here is my quote"" (Smith, 113).  When currently, MLA guidelines would have one write this out without the comma, as (Smith 113).  This is the only thing I would change in the presentation.  Other than that small detail, it is awesome!  Thanks, Mary, for making a resource available on a topic that usually isn't much fun to teach!",5
3782,"This is an excellent StAIR lesson on plagiarism.  I plan on using this with my middle school students.  There is nothing in the lesson that is above their learning level.  This lesson is well organized and will benefit a wide audience.  The only thing that I would add or modify would be how to cite in APA-only because it is a requirement that my students learn both.  Although it should be taught in other subject areas, I still want my students exposed.  Fantastic lesson!",5
3783,Extremely helpful links included with enough resources for students to gain a basic understanding of global issues.Technical Remarks:User friendly and easy to navigate,4
3784,"This is an excellent lesson focusing on an essential skill in this information age. As students are inundated with information, they need to be taught how to discern and sort through all the noise. Doing online research well is crucial to their academic and career success. This lesson should be a requirement for every high school student, and could even be repeated to emphasize its importance. It is a great way to start a research project.Technical Remarks:No technical problems.",5
3784,"This lesson would be a good starter, introductory lesson to any major project.  ",4
3784,"This lesson is designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of authoritative research resources on which to base their writing.  The lesson involves quintessential bibliographic instruction activities and librarians and media specialists will be delighted to deliver and/or play a critical support role in delivering this content.  Students are challenged to make use of their media center, media specialist, and the high quality online research resources available to them.  ",5
3784,"This goal-directed lesson plan is focused on teaching students how to determine whether or not an internet source is creditable or not. This was clearly stated under the section titled problem/need. The lesson plan walks users through specific steps on how to use the lesson plan. The plan itself provides students with several ways to access the information being taught by using different forms of teaching. The students are taught a concept, misconceptions are corrected through assessment and discussion and then a constructive on project is facilitated. Technical Remarks:No technical issues to report",5
3785,"This document showcases the need for students to apply for work permits after graduation. It explains the importance of this and explains who the important agencies to contact actually are. This document does not necessarily showcase how to teach this information to eligible individuals. It showcases how the material will be presented (meetings, presentations, PowerPoints, QandA, and an OPT packet) but does not give links to this information. The plan outlines what it is attempting to showcase eligible individuals, but does not show how it will do so. Someone attempting to use this document would have a hard time doing so without the accompanying documents. If provided, it would then be possible to assess the quality of the lesson in its ability to reach all learners. Technical Remarks:There is a lack of links to relevant resources. Adding the links to this resource would make this a much more effective document. ",2
3786,"Great lesson plan for 3rd graders! The incorporation of technology (Kidspiration software, Internet, and computers) makes this lesson plan engaging and interesting. As I understood students will be learning individually on this assignment; have you thought of having student work in groups? It’s great that in addition to viewing weather technologies online, students will have an opportunity to explore how they work. I think it is wonderful that student will get to showcase their work to peers as well as to other students in the school. I think the NETS standards critical thinking, problem solving and decision making are met very well in this lesson plan. I think the UDL principles, instructional design and instructional strategies were met very well.",4
3786,"Provided detailed information for 3rd grade students to learn about severe weather and what is needed in a survival kit. NETS –Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, Decision Making.Technical Remarks:Kidspiration Software will be  used for this lesson which is a great software.Could add a link to provide a list of where hurricanes occur the most around the world.",4
3787,This lesson seems well organized and it seems to adhere well to the UDL principles overall.  It is very easy to see that you used reverse design in creating this lesson and the goals are very clearly stated.  My primary concern is that students don’t have many options or paths to take when it comes to demonstrating their understanding of the content.  I have had any experience with flipcharts myself but would be interested to see if their was a way to incorporate and type of videocast into them for students who struggle with learning and demonstrating understanding with text.  Student who might struggle with reading may struggle with aspects of this assignment.  I would love to seem some technology aides incorporated such as text to talk to help those students who might not be able to handle the reading load that well.  Overall I think your lesson is well organized.  ,4
3787,"The lesson seems very interesting, yet it doesn't seem age appropriate for the age group you chose. This seems more appropriate for 4th graders. I like that the students will generate a class rubric.Technical Remarks:As a suggestion, maybe list a few website options for students to evaluate.",3
3788,"I think this source is great, especially for teaching purposes.",4
3789,"Neat display of the orbits of global position satellites.  I am not sure how this applet could be used in an educational setting, however.",3
3790,This is clearly a fun lesson designed for second graders.  Students are asked write the instructions to make a sandwich to eat. Then they are to make the sandwich and eat it.  The objectives are clearly stated and involved a lot of collaboration among the students. I am impressed that the young students are encouraged to use a rubric when making their sandwiches. The length of the lesson is appropriate for the age group.Technical Remarks:The technology the students use is a word processer for writing their recipes and a digital camera to capture their creations. At the end of the lessons the students are to eat their sandwiches together.,4
3790,"This lesson takes a unique spin on the traditional writing instructions for a PB&J sandwich.  The students are writing directions for their own sandwich creation, which they will actually make their peers and help fundraise for the school. This is a great way to get students motivated to learn.   There is some scaffolding in the lesson by presenting exemplars of sandwich directions and demonstrating making a sandwich.  A useful addition to this lesson may be during this demonstration, actually using a set of directions that students have written as a group and showing what “holes” they might have in their steps that they need to think about when writing their own directions.Technical Remarks:It is not clear from the lesson plan where technology is used.  Under technology needs the author mentions computers, printers, camera, and time in the computer lab.  However, these elements were never addressed in the lesson plan so it is unclear what students are doing with these technology tools.  Therefore, I think the technology component could be highlighted more.  To make another means of engagement, the students could perhaps use a program like KidPix to illustrate their sandwich using digital media.",4
3791,"This stand-alone presentation on the four main parts of speech (noun, verb, adverb, and adjective) has clearly defined standards and target audience. The theme is age appropriate and the author taken photos from the Denver botanical gardens are a perfect touch. Not only are the links to the corresponding Grammar Rocks video clips informative and instructive, they offer a bit of nostalgia for the teacher and parent. I have come to find that those videos are still relevant, entertaining, and extremely useful even in high school. One small correction would be the inclusion of ideas in the “nouns’ definition. Also, it might be better if the topic of Pronouns is avoided due to them serving the identical purpose of Nouns, though that may be over the heads of the lesson’s intended audience. The use of the same sentence as an example is a brilliant touch. The repetition is effective in its simplicity and clearly shows the student the connections the parts of speech have to each other.",5
3791,"Wow! The author has done a fantastic job presenting the information on grammar with visuals and interactive components.  Each section of grammar; nouns, adverbs, verbs, and adjectives was carefully organized and laid out so that the user could clearly distinguish between each one.  For each type of word, the information was relevant and appropriate for the grade level.  Each word provided specific examples and then allowed the user to assess their grasp and knowledge of each type of word.  The assessments gave clear answers and the flow was never interupted by a wrong answer.  The author has created an outstanding product that should be very useful for those being introduced to proper grammar.  The only thing that may be missing is an objective page, but the introduction clearly implies that the objective is to learn the four types of words, so an objective page may be a bit redudant.  Overall, this stand alone instructional resourse has great flow, excellent information, fantastic examples, and a user-friendly platform.  Outstanding!Technical Remarks:All links were active, great video link to School House Rock.",5
3792,"The slideshow seems like a good idea, but the error in one of the recurring slides was disappointing.Technical Remarks:When choosing the correct answer, a slide appears saying ""Your correct"". Shouldn't that be ""You're correct""?",2
3793,"This online version of the OLF famous bilingual technical dictionary (from Quebec) is an important resource for courses dealing with technical or specialized vocabulary. I use it mainly in advanced and graduate courses in translation and multimedia resources. One may search for words in English or in French. The search engine retrieves the fields or domains of application of the words, provides translations, closely related words and ""expressions to be avoided"" - which are often literal translations. Comments on usage show how French Canadian usage differs from metropolitan French usage. For an example see the discussion on ""mel"" and ""courriel"".",5
3794,"    This is a great lesson plan to help students use online graphic organizers for their writing pieces using Kidspiration.  It includes various teaching and learning strategies so that the students can tailor the final product in a way that makes sense to them.  The students can use a web that they feel works best for their writing piece.  The peer reviews are a great way to promote socialization as well as help with editing and revising. This lesson addresses ISTE standards like Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Decision Making, and Creativity.  I like that this lesson can be done in the classroom or exclusively online.Technical Remarks:Eduplace.com could also be used as it has free Graphic Organizers and gives examples of different webs to use for different writing pieces.",5
3794,This lesson gives students exposure to a new technology that will aid in the writing process. Students brainstorm and collaborate online with peers to generate ideas. This lesson builds on skills needed to be successful in the 21st Century workforce. Technical Remarks:Popplet.com would be a free alternative to Kidspiration.,5
3795,"The lesson was very well organized and certainly met the criteria of a real-world need.  Graphing is a necessary skill for many individuals, especially those entering the math and science fields.  It is also very valuable for inividuals to be able to read graphs to understand data that is presented in such a format.  I felt the lesson was appropriate for the age and would keep students engaged.  Well done!Technical Remarks:Using microsof word is a good way to integrate computers into the lesson - the only recommendation I would make would be to use either excel or software dedicated to graphing.",5
3795,"This lesson plan has a concise objective and an effective, easily confirmed assessment. The author’s motivation through group work is well fitted for the intended age group. The teacher modeling is a great instructional method for this age group, but should extend to the creation of the survey as well as the meaning of the math terms presented. The lesson is inclusive to kinesthetic, visual, and auditory learners alike. One improvement might be to make the graph physically with Legos as a medium, take a still picture, and insert that photo into the Word document using text boxes over the picture to label the graph. This could cater more to the often neglected kinesthetic learner. The technology needed is widely used and commonly available. The optional presentation is an engaging addition and can be a strong social capstone for the lesson. Overall this is an engaging, age-appropriate lesson with defined, attainable objectives.",4

3797,"This is a good kiosk for learning the pattern of syllables used in the lines of Haiku poetry.  It lest students count syllables, gives definitions, and lets them read samples.  Easy to use and straight-forward.Technical Remarks:I had trouble running this material.  Each time I advanced a slide I recieved error messages and on several pages I was told I needed the proper viewer to see the page.  There were error messages about incorrect file extensions, but I think my computer is to blame.",4
3797,This lesson is designed to help students learn and practice identifying syllables in a Haiku poem. This resource is easy to use and supported by audio to help students with comprehension. I would like to see more visuals showing what a haiku is and visualizing the lines of the poem. I would also like to see a teacher page. Technical Remarks:PowerPoint Viewer is required to view the resource.,4
3797,"I really like the sounds you include in your project.  It's especially important in a lesson like this so it was nice that you included it.  It is very easy to navigate and not too complicated.  It would be nice to have a couple more examples of ""Is it a Haiku?""  That way if students didn't get it the first time, it would give them more opportunities to learn.  Another suggestion I have is to have students learn why they got something wrong rather than just come right out and tell them the correct answer.  Maybe have a clip of someone saying the word and clapping or snapping out the syllables would help.  Technical Remarks:Great flow.  All links worked properly.",4
3797,"This StAIR is intended for use with 2nd grade students, but I could also see using this with my third grade students. The StAIR is in depth enough for students to reach the intended end point, but is not so lengthy as to discourage students from completing the whole project. It is simple to follow and is not overwhelmed by graphics, allowing students to get the contect without distractions. It is also easy to navigate, which is a great asset for a tool meant for younger students. Overall, I think this is a great, easy to implement activity.Technical Remarks:User must have PowerPoint viewer",5
3797,"Great resource for second graders! I love the visual and the auditory assistance in this assignment. The voices are easily heard and understood. The only change I would suggest would be to snap & say the lines of the sentence if the student chooses the wrong number, and then don't give them the answer but make them listen and count with you. Then the student can feel like they learned it and discovered the answer on their own. I strongly believe in students learning from their mistakes and trying again. Technical Remarks:PowerPoint functions perfectly. Easy to navigate, even for second graders. Great job. ",4
3797,Very nice!  I especially like the sound clips added in.  ,5
3797,"This is a Stand Alone Instructional Resource that teaches second grade students about Haikus.  The author teaches students about this Japanese poem that consists of three lines containing a pattern of five syllables in the first line, seven syllables in the second, and five again in the third.  She accomplishes this through various examples that include both visual and auditory examples.  She also gives students feedack by having them answer example questions and lets them know if they are correct.  I enjoyed this presentation and it would be useful for early elementary classrooms studying poetry.Technical Remarks:Sometimes the slides move too quickly and the audio is lost.",4
3797,"I actually enjoyed learning about Haiku’s, it was nice to try them out as I fallowed along the StAIR. I enjoyed the process of relearning what a Haiku is. This StAIR was well organized and easy to fallow. I also like how the different words of importance are defined. Unfortunately, because the links were not working for me I could not get the flow of this StAIR. This StAIR could had also tapped into some of the learner background knowledge in order for them to grasp the subject better. It would be nice if students could have the chance to create their own Haiku’s with a set of given words and for them to see some individuals saying Haikus.",4
3798,I selected about half the ethical cases included in chapters 3 and 4 for students to read for homework early in my introductory anthropology course.  Our discussion at the next class was extremely lively; the students were fascinated by the cases and their implications and we had a very productive discussion of ethical problems in anthropology that helped the students understand these issues far more deeply than they would have from a textbook discussion of ethics.,5

3801,"In this lesson plan, smart board was used as a learning tool to present and discuss the material with the students. Real world application of artwork was used to grab students' attention. While going through the lesson plan, I felt that more details were needed on how it would be done. I also thought that adding a video or some kind of media will be more useful in the explaining and demonstration process. This way the lesson will be able to reach all type of learners. Overall, it is a great lesson.Technical Remarks:None",4
3801,"This lesson would be a good lesson to implement following the introduction to the elements of art StAIR that you created.  Granted: The StAIR was designed for use with middle school students whereas this plan is for high school students.  It’s possible that either of these could be “tweaked” for use with students at either level.Using even a basic drawing/painting program with students can be a great way to introduce color theory to students by having them create digital works of art.  Similar lessons can, and often are, taught the old fashioned way with paints, paper/canvas, brushes, etc.  Of course, using these older methods would require the students to also manage the physical supplies properly and clean up at the end of an art making session.  Depending on where the students are in their art education in your classroom, managing these supplies properly can be a lesson in and of itself.  Having students work digitally at the beginning of their color theory can help them focus on just this area of their art education.  The lessons on using actual painting supplies, an important lesson, can happen on another day.The lesson plan calls for the use of a Smart Board but only for sharing of the work the students have completed at the end of the lesson.  This technology could also be used at the demonstration phase of this lesson and could even be used by some of the students to create their actual art pieces.  Personally, I think the reason why I don’t enjoy creating artwork myself digitally is because I miss the directness that I get from putting a pencil/pastel/paint brush onto a sheet of paper/canvas.  With a computer, in order to draw a picture I have to manipulate a mouse that is on the table to my right while the picture itself is up on the computer screen.  I suspect that some students may have a similar struggle.  Depending on the sensitivity of the mouse itself, this struggle could be further complicated.  If the students were given the option to create their digital pieces more directly by using the Smart Board screen as their drawing surface and their finger as the drawing tool these struggles might be alleviated.",4
3801,"I am a elementary teacher that had the job to review and analyze the lesson plan of this author.  What the author did well was that she provided examples of color schemes from popular culture.  This real world application would make the lesson easier to grasp.  Also, I thought the socialization activity was meaningful for students as they used the SMART board to discuss student work.  The author could have used multiple media to help her instruction on the color wheel and color theory.  This would assist both visual and auditory learners easier.Technical Remarks:There were not technological glitches in pulling up the lesson plan.",4
3802,You have a built-in engagement factor here because you are using Facebook.  Great idea!  Will you guide students to certain sites for their research or will students be free to choose where their info comes from?  This is also a fantastic way to get students applying history and social studies.  Something that can be challenging sometimes.  I was trying to think of something similar to this for use next year.  Thanks!,5
3802,"The lesson for creating a Facebook page for major historical figures is a unique way to engage students in the understanding of these people and their contributions to society. The lesson is organized in a fashion that allows students to learn background knowledge on their person via internet search engines prior to creating the Facebook page, which will be sure that students are still learning the key information and not building their page as they go along. I know my students would be thrilled to be able to use ""Facebook"" in school and not get in trouble for doing so. Giving students a guideline but also allowing for flexibility and creativity during the lesson displays UDL principles. It is also nice that you are having your students share lesson plans in various ways.",5
3802,"I can tell from this lesson plan that students would be very eager to complete this assignment!  The buy-in factor will not be difficult.  Since you are having students use the internet to research their character, I can see how different sites will provide Universal Design for Learning.  Students will have freedom to use different resources to obtain their data that best fit their learning style.  It is also helpful that you are providing a sample for students.  This type of assignment could be very valuable to student learning, particularly because students can relate to what “Friends” are considered and so forth.  They start to take that person’s life and connect it to real-world, modern day connections.  Great job!Technical Remarks:Do you have any particular websites that students will be encouraged to use while completing the research?  Also, is there a template link for your Facebook PowerPoint?

3807,"I really enjoyed this presentation.  The way Laura related the idea of ""A Bill to Law"" with a road trip was great.  She was able to use real life situations with a road trip to identify the general ideas behind a bills ""trip"" to becoming a law.  She also provided a lot of detailed information through direct instruction.  I felt the ""snack time"" quizzes were engaging.  My only suggestion in updating this presentation would be when students get questions wrong they are instructed to ""try again.""  I would have liked to see some wrong answers receive more in-depth feedback or even being sent back to where the answer is provided in the powerpoint.  This just might provide students who are misunderstanding or not reading carefully a chance to revisit the information before a second attempt.  But this is a minor change and not absolutely necessary.  Overall I really enjoyed this presentation and would definitely consider using this in my Government class.",4

I have, however, noticed that most voice recognition software is available only for PC.  They mentioned that this may change in the near future - for the sake of accessability I truly hope so.  Education and Apple go hand in hand, so it would behoove them to serve this part of the student population. There is some software available for Apple users:

3810,"This was a difficult StAIR for me to review, as I was unable to interact with the video or exlore any of the diagrams. I am not sure of the reason for that, or if something was missing from the presentation. The information on the slides was very thorough, but without the ancillary materials the presentation is obviously limited to a smaller group of learners whose skills lie in reading and recalling. The video aspect would surely add a dimension and help those who are visual and auditory learners. Additionally, I think the interactive diagrams would be great for exploring the human body and its various systems. The quiz section worked well for me, and I liked the combination of visuals and texts. I think one thing (that I have not done either) that might be helpful would be not only a statement of error, but also an explanation of why their answer is not correct. For example, one questions correct answer is all of the above, perahaps if the response acknowledge their answer as partially correct it would help students to find the ultimate answer more quickly.

3813,"The author provides some scaffolding for students.  At the beginning of the presentation it breaks down the components of the report using an example.  The example is broken down into heading, subheading, bullet points, and the different paragraphs.  Each of these components is explained both visually and orally.  However the oral support is lost during the recap quiz.  The questions are simply given in words. The recap quiz just requires students to recall facts and not use higher-level thinking skills.  In order to have students use higher-level skills the author could have them apply their knowledge to a new report and click on different features as prompted by the program.  After the recap quiz there is one content slide that presents one last component of reports- that they have pictures and captions.  This would probably be better placed prior to the recap quiz for coherency sake.Technical Remarks:The user does not have the option to input his or her response and get feedback from the program.  This could easily be embedded in this tutorial since the questions are already true or false.  The author could make a button for users to click for each response, which would direct them to different slides accordingly.",3
3813,"This stand alone instructional design is for teaching second graders how to write reports.  It is simple with a unique, modern design that I think the students will appreciate.  The teacher has many instructional strategies, such as giving examples of what a reports looks like and asking relevant questions to get her students thinking about the writing process.  I am impressed that there are actual recordings explaining to and asking questions of the students.  I believe this is a very good way to motivate them and teacher is following the UDL principle of applying the lesson to different learners.  The mapping out the parts of a report is also very important for teaching writing.  I believe the objectives of teaching how to write a simple report have been met.  The students are challenged through verbal and true and false questions. They interact with the material and are rewarded with written feedback and correct answers.  The design flows smoothly and all the links work.  The only thing I might change is adding some cute clip art and making the assignment a little longer by showing more examples of actual student papers.

It does a very good job of explaining the tags and the information is organized well. Unfortunately, the Try It Out function no longer works and students can't view their code within the tutorial. However, I would ask students to type their code into a Notepad and save as an html file to turn in as an assignment. The only shortcoming of this tutorial was the section on Image Mapping, but I feel students would still benefit from understanding the basic concept and then using an editing program to accurately map out their images later.",5

3821," The focus of this lesson is to teach students how to appropriately use social media to learn content information. This lesson is broken into separate pieces, teaching the students about individual concepts. This is a good strategy to make sure the students do not receive too much information all at once.

3827,"This is a great activity!! You have made instruction on insects very interactive. The use of sounds was an engaging way to keep the attention of students while they learn about the different features of an insect. I especially love the sounds and the animations of the insects. I know children will be captivated by them and want to learn more. The information presented in the activity was geared toward lower elementary. I think it would be perfect for first to second grade based on the word usage. The inclusion of quizzing along the way is a great way for students to test their knowledge on what they just learned. Linking the wrong answers back to the information is helpful for students to reread to find the answer. I know my students get mixed up with whether a spider is an insect, so it was great to include that! Overall I think this was well-done and hope to use it in my classroom!Technical Remarks:All of the links worked, and I found no glitches. If you wanted it to be geared towards younger grades, you could easily add recorded directions and voice recording of the information they read.",4
3827,"Great crisp colors and wonderful “real-life” and authentic pictures.  This makes learning more fun!  It also gives students a visual with the words.  I liked the way you went back to review the material for incorrect answers.    Next time, let the student come to an answer instead of sharing the correct answer.  Let them take the time to review and come to a conclusion. The design was good, students were guided in a sequential order about insects: general info, habitat and then into life cycle.  All very important material for a first grade student.    The sound effects that correspond with slides were amusing.  Students learned through inductive reasoning, students were shown information and then quizzed on learning.  You did a nice job of defining the parts of an insect; it helped students to understand the purpose of the body part.  Students had to scaffold their knowledge in order to successfully complete the quizzes.   At the beginning I would add one short page telling the students a quick synopsis of what they will be learning before they get to the choices home page.  I enjoyed the final page where students were shown lots of insects and given an approval message of being an “Insect Pro”.  Great positive feedback!Technical Remarks:It would be great if students could have a page of different insects that they could click on to hear their calls or sounds.

3832,"This is an outstanding lesson to get students to take action.  Character education means a lot coming from a principal.  I am interested in the book, One by Kathryn Otoshi, that you used in the lesson and plan to buy a copy to use in my classroom.  Bullying is a huge issue during recess at my school.  Teaching students how to take action will be extremely beneficial for the well-being of the school and each classroom.  A YouTube video and Skype were used to appropriately integrate technology into the lesson.  The captions on the YouTube video enable to students to view what is being said, but it may be helpful for someone to read the captions (in English) for the auditory learners in the classroom.  This technology also introduces students to children in different cultures, which will hopefully help students appreciate one another and the similarities and differences among us.",5
3833,"This is an awesome StAIR.  It really incorporates a lot of the UDL principles and instructional strategies to make learning accessible to all students.  Specifically, I like how this includes audio with the slides.  This is an excellent way to allow auditory learners the same opportunities as visual learners.  Also, it provides the information for visually challenged students.  Another part of the StAIR that I found to be very helpful was the specific feedback given to students for incorrect answers in the quiz portions.  Overall, the resource does a good job incorporating various learning styles with audio, text, and visual cues. Technical Remarks:For the 32nd slide the option for selecting ""NO"" does not have a link.  Also, I had trouble viewing the videos on my version of PowerPoint. ",5

3833,"This was a great presentation. Very informative on a subject I know nothing about. Your voice thread over the slides allows the students to use their senses to absorb the information. The videos are short, engaging and to the point. They provide the students with great information about the business practices in each area of the world. The quizzes force the students to think about what they learned and are appropriate.Technical Remarks:I had a little trouble getting the videos to play, but that could be due to the old XP computer I am using.My suggestions for your Stair would be to add questions after each of the videos, this would help the students focus on each region and get instant feedback for their learning from the video.Also, a helpful tool could be to have some case studies at the end. Give the students a scenario from one of the countires and have them answer questions based on what happened. This would allow them to use all the information from beginning of the presentation to the end.",5
3834,"This is a very well written lesson plan. It puts the student in the character of an art collector who is able to purchase photography and argue its authenticity.The lesson plan covers three state standards for visual arts, which are 2.3, 2.6 and 3.2. This project is broken down into six days, which consists of computer/lab work (research), the creation of a power point presentation, and then a presentation to the class on what they have researched.For UDL, I like how students can learn independently on what they want to research in art as opposed to learning about a specific artwork, they are given their own freedom and creativity to choose and express their work. This helps open the door for creativity.I think something that may improve the lesson are giving them different options to present their material other than in powerpoint. This could include using an interactive white board, or a document camera (if applicable). It may help the student express their creativity.",5
3834,"This lesson plan provides an excellent opportunity for students to put themselves in the shoes of an art collector.  They are asked to critically look at photographs and decide which 4 they would like to ""buy.""The lesson is subdivided into 4 days of work and 2 days of presentations.  Students have assigned work to complete on each of the 4 work days.  This level of structure will help students that need (crave) structure.There are 3 networks of UDL.  The Affective Network is really being exercised in this assignment when the students choose which photographs they liked, and explain why.Students learn about photographs by conducting their own research.  Discovery learning is a great way to get students interested and let them explore their interests.  When students get to choose part of what they learn, they tend to enjoy and persue it more.One thing that might improve the lesson is allowing students to complete a different type of project.  Maybe some students prefer to create projects using their hands more (and computers less).Technical Remarks:Well done.  There are no technical mistakes with this Word Document.",4
3835,"Thomas, I think the greatest take away from your STAIR is how detailed the information you provide is.  In each and every slide you break down the information into its simplest form and this allows the individual viewer to really think about extended readng.  Also, I like the check-ins that serve as quizzes throughout the STAIR.  They seem to be evenly spaced out and allow the viewer to be quizzed on an acceptable amount of information they had to digest.A couple of areas I would look for improvement is removing the sound transitions that are apart of this presentation.  A large portion involves information being placed periodically throughout and these many transitions can be distracting as you are trying to process the information.  Also, I would allow more information to be introduced at once so the STAIR does not take as long to grow through, but provide slightly more time inbetween transitions so the information can be processed better.Technical Remarks:The video at the beginning did not work, but I am starting to see a connection between errors when downloading from GoogleDocs so I am not sure if there is anything that could be done to fix that.",4
3835,"Overall, I thought that your presenation was very informative and well put together.  I really liked the navigation tools at the bottom of your presenation.  I thought it made it easy for students to work at their own pace, spending time reading through the presenation.  I also like the role play activity towards that presentation.  I liked the feedback it gave and how the students had to put all their knowledge to answer the questions thoughtfully. One thing that I thought you could improve upon are the animations that you had on the slides.  I liked that they grabbed the attention of the viewer on each slide but I found it a little distracting when I was reading the slide.  I had to re-read to make sure I got the information.  You might just want to put the sound with the first bullet point and not the rest.  I also found that the red writing was a little hard to read at times.  You may want to try a more dull shade of red. I also had some technical difficulties; please see below.Technical Remarks:I was not able to view your video introduction about what Extensive Reading is.  I clicked on the video but nothing ever happened.  Because of this, I was a little confused at the beginning of the presenation.  I also found that sometimes that arrows on the pages were not working and it wouldn't let me move ahead or go back to the previous slide unless I started over at the beginning.  Lastly, I was not able to use the link to e-mail you at the end because my default mailer isn't set up.  You may want to add your e-mail address to the slide in case other people run into this problem as well.",3

3859,"The ideas and content behind this lesson are very well thought out, strong and geared towards upper elementary students. The goal oriented design plan is well thought out and every aspect is addressed including problem/need, real world performance, an instructional objective, and essential content. The lesson begins by having students share examples and prior knowledge of tall tales and recording them on chart paper. Students are then asked to model various examples of what tall stories by looking through texts and books. A suggestion maybe to model and write a class tall tale prior to students writing their own. This would be a great way to really help those struggling students to see the process of writing and thinking needed when creating this project. Another great idea would be to provide at-risk or struggling students a writing skeleton to help them stay on track. Also, having an audio text, book online read to the students would be another great way of using technology within the lesson.Next in the lesson, teacher and students look for the characteristics of tall tales and together while reading a tall tale aloud, which is a great way to teach to those auditory listeners. Students are then asked to create a graphic organizer and listing the characteristics of their own stories. This is a great way to incorporate cooperative learning and differentiated instruction, which are important pedagogies to use within a classroom. Once students are given an opportunity to investigate and read tall stories, they are asked to create and write their own using a graphic organizer and a digital story telling tool, Kerpoof. This is another great UDL principal for allowing students to represent and apply their learning in various ways through technology. Students are encouraged to be creative, apply what they learned, evaluate and rate one another’s writing. Another great idea of this lesson is that it will allow students to be proud of their work by posting it onto the school’s website and the class blackboard. This allows more of a real world application to their work!  Overall, this is a well thought out lesson that addresses many pedagogies, strategies and great use of technology!Technical Remarks:This lesson plan is very easy to follow and to implement in the classroom.  I do not see any issues with it at all!! In order to fully teach this lesson the way it was designed, a blackboard, a subscription to kerpoof, with student accounts, as well as Internet.  This lesson is rich in  technology and there are numerous ways to increase it as well!",5

In this StAIR, information is provided in a variety of formats and student must answer questions correctly to proceed through the content.Technical Remarks:The StAIR is easy to use although the video didn't work for me and the link to the outside website forced me to start the StAIR over. Because there is so much information to learn over Classical and Operant conditioning I would consider making two StAIRs out it.",4
3862,"This was an effective teaching tool for learning about classical and operant conditioning. The text layout was visually appealing and nice to work with.   The UDL principles worked well, and the relearning helpfully brought the viewer back to the original point then to the questions in a way that worked well. Many of the slides had some visuals, but some of the wordier ones could have used something small.   However, the slides that were exclusively diagrams were excellent and a needed break from subject matter that has a tendency to be dense. A small mechanical correction to consider would be not to put a period on the end of sentence fragments. Or choose to always use periods, but just be consistent throughout.Technical Remarks:Technically this UDL worked well except that the links to the videos were broken.",5

3868,"This lesson is very thorough in establishing steps between technology and pedagogy.  I like the time dedicated to instruction to a website, this is helpful for those students who are not as expereinced users and establishes a boundry for students who are. Using a quizlet in different modes is a good way to scaffold information and the use of independent laptop acitivity and group acitivty vis smartboard is balanced. Three days seems a little long for this lesson and an alternative acitvity for early finishers might help students stay on foucs.",4
3868,"I think using the quizlet site makes an otherwise potentially boring vocabulary much more interesting and interactive.  Though, as teachers, we have to be aware of the importance of test scores, I would like to think that there are deeper reasons for becoming competent in science vocabulary.  Perhaps some of these deeper reasons could be searched out and stated in the lesson plan.It is good that there is time set aside to learn how to use the site before assigning the quiz to the students.  I didn't see a link to the exact quiz to be used for this lesson, so I am assuming it is something that the teacher designs based on the needs of his/her students.  I did Google quizlet and the site was easy enough to find and seems fairly self-explanatory for the teacher.  However, perhaps the plan could note that there is additional prep time for the teacher as it did not appear to be a ""ready-made"" quiz.  I do think it is great that the quizlet site helps with the evaluation and assessment by allowing the teachers to receive the quiz results after the quiz is completed.  Also, I saw in section 4 that there was a lesson plan attached.  I would have liked to see this lesson plan, too, in order to take advantage of the ""learning activities"" mentioned.  Again, this is only to not have to reinvent the wheel as a busy teacher.Overall a good lesson with a creative spin on teaching vocabulary.Technical Remarks:I had no technical difficulties.  The pdf opened with no problems.",4
3868,"I think the lesson was very good and informative.  I didn't agree with the fact that students needed to improve their vocabulary in order to improve scores on exams.  I understand that this is a real concern for many of us teachers, but I do not feel that it should be the problem as to why we teach vocabulary.  Perhaps teaching vocabulary to help them improve reading and reading comprehension would be a better problem that needs to be faced.  Using the quizlet site for vocab review is great.  It really gives the students the power to interact with the terms, and does it in a medium with which they are familiar.  Being able to access students' results via the internet is great for the teacher as well because the teacher can then see where different students were having trouble.  Using the site and the internet may allow teachers to help individual students with their different problems.  Students who are visual can read the info, and using the internet allows kinesthetic learners and auditory learners to have access to motion and/or headphones to help them interact with the material.Technical Remarks:I didn't have any technical problems.",4
3869,"This lesson provides  younger students the opportunity to utilize technology in the classroom in a meaningful way. It takes an old concept and addresses it in a new way with several meaningful ways. It really provides students with instruction that is presented visually, auditorally, and kinesthetically. Especially for younger students who need to move, wiggle, and discover their world it meets the necessary criteria.Technical Remarks:Another option for this lesson is to provide students with a character for each letter. I have seen teachers associate letters and their sounds to stuffed bean animals. The students with names beginning with the same letter as the animal are able to hold the animal during the day.",4
3869,"This provides many instructional strategies to reinforce and build on letter recognition. This lesson is designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of learners with various learning styles and needs. It also addresses ISTE standards. The lesson teaches letter recognition in a relevant and novel way. There are numerous strategies that promote socialization, a key component to early childhood education.Technical Remarks:Suggestions:For further observation of student learning, send home a survey to parents, asking: ""How do you see your child use letters at home? Which ones?""Add activities that use the taste and smell senses. For example, have sliced apples for students to taste and smell when they learn about letter ""A"", pretzels for ""P"", etc.   ",5

3871,"This site has beautiful pictures of life in Korea that are well organized by category. However, the labeling of pictures is sometimes confusing, particularly in the ""Cultue Shock"" section. Readers with no prior knowledge of Korean food or Korean language will have difficulty determining which description matches with which picture. 
 
To enhance the site as an educational tool, consider putting labels on the pictures in Hangul as well as English. Additionally, although the smaller picture size may make the pictures download faster for the user, if some pictures were larger and in higher definition it would be more rewarding for the user. ",3

3875,"This lesson plan states clearly the objectives and the methods that will help children learn about lines and movement. It states clearly the different lines and its various directions and qualities through a PowerPoint presentation. It also provides multiple means of representation through the art done by famous people in addition to the art done by students from years before. The students will stay engaged throughout the lesson since they will be viewing a series of works of art where they identify the different lines. I would recommend an activity where students actually draw these lines   before doing the final project. This could be done as a group activity where each group is assigned different lines and then present them to the class. This way they will get to practice before doing the watercolor painting. Overall, it is a  great lesson plan. Great Job!Technical Remarks:None",4
3875,"I have done a very similar watercolor lesson showing “movement.” I liked your suggestions of projecting the students’ artwork on a larger scale to produce the wow-factor. The lesson plan was nicely written and easy to follow. I think the PowerPoint used at the start of the lesson with examples of artwork that show movement, and others that do not is a very strong point to the lesson. This allows students to begin analyzing artwork looking for specific principles. This also offers a real world application; students will see how other artists have implemented the principle into their work.Technical Remarks:No problems.",4

3888,Very helpful and simple timeline.Technical Remarks:Using KidPix here!,5
3889,"This game is great for developing the mathematical skills of young kids and it can be useful for some adults as well. It is good because it covers the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Another good thing about this game is that it has three levels: easy, medium and hard. By the way the hard level can be challenging for many adults and the reason for that is people depend a lot on calculators. When they try to calculate mentally or without using a calculator, they find themselves very slow and very hesitant.

When you play this game you receive feedback right away after each attempt. The design of the game is very attractive for the kids because it has very beautiful colors; it is full of motions and has got a lot of sounds. It is a very good place for whoever wants to develop his/her mathematical skills. Even for those who are good at mathematics, the game will be an excellent source for refreshing their memory and making them faster in solving mathematical problems related to the four operations. I highly recommend it for primary school teachers and adults who are weak at mathematics",4

3898,"First, I think it would be more accurate to label this a 'course structure' as it contains insufficient information for independent study. That said, the resource should be valuable for educators seeking to design a course in the area of modern art and mass culture. The resource comprises a syllabus, lecture notes (pdf format), assignments, exams and reading lists. The course content and organisation seem logical and a potentially stimulating range of works is covered to support each lesson. The lecture notes vary in the level of detail provided, with some offering more detailed guidance than others in terms of the suggested lesson content. Again, while this should not be problematic for an educator specialising in this area it does limit the potential of the resource for an independent learner.Technical Remarks:Viewed on Chrome. No technical problems.",3

Technical Remarks:Glogster took a realy long time to open, not sure if it's on my end. Never used Glogster before. Thank you for adding the link in the presentation, it helped me understand the lesson better.",4
3906,"This is a simple, straitforward lesson plan that would be easy to implement in most classes and could be adapted for younger or older students. The featured technology, glogster, is ideal for meeting the set technology standard. I can see adapting this lesson for use in a language arts class. Technical Remarks:Students that do not have computer access have the option to complete a collage.",5
3907,"This seems like a very cool lesson plan for a physical education class.  I like how this allows the teacher to integrate technology into a physical education setting.  Specifically, I think that students will be motivated to improve when they have an opportunity to watch themselves play on the Moodle site.  This lesson will work great for hands on learners and for visual learners when they have the opportunity to watch themselves play.  Also, the lesson provides a great instructional strategy to allow the students to monitor their progress in class. Technical Remarks:Perhaps some UDL principles could be added auditory or text learners or even students with physical disabilities.  Students with disabilities could read about the game or listen or watch video of others playing and critique their performances to offer suggested areas of improvement. ",4
3907,"This lesson plan is easy to follow and understand. The use of Moodle in a PE class is a great idea. By watching videos of other students and seeing what good skills look like, students will be able to improve on their own skills. As an athlete, I know how invaluable it is to see yourself making technical mistakes, and being able to make changes quickly. Receiving criticism is a very difficult thing for many students to do, but this lesson is designed in a way that criticism is welcome.To get students more involved, students could video tape another. Students could also blog about their experience of watching themselves play football.",4

Spent tons of time going through variouse subjects all with large graphics and sound to help aid the learning.Technical Remarks: Iteractive from the start. Kids can watch an alien move or a plane fly by, along with some sound bits. You can learn anything from astronauts living in space to how their rockets and airplanes work to even being able to do projects and games to be able to learn on your own.     Showes  pictures of actual astronauts and all the rockets and space crafts that nasa uses.With a club that kids can join to learn more, with monthly emails of new things going on with nasa to more projects and games for the kids to try.

3914,"This evaluation was prepared by Victoria Gray and Jacqueline Gutierrez. This video was created by Troy Tenhet, an instructor from Kern High School in the Panama-Buena Vista School District for NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.  This is a clever presentation that begins with an old fashioned 1950s style filmstrip juxtaposed with a new water cycle visualization presentation being prepared by Emma, a NASA scientist. An animated creation, Molecule Max, interacts with Emma to explain the Earths water cycle, how it is changing and the ways in which NASA is studying and using this information. This clever presentation is sure to be a big hit with kids in grades 5-8. The use of Flash technology helps ensure that older students will enjoy the presentation as well! 

The webpage is easy to navigate and everything points to the use of the Molecule Max video. Text is easy to read and well written. It is easy enough to stop and start the video in case the instructor wants to take questions from students or point something out. Overall this is a well done presentation and utilizes the most up-to-date information from NASA to shows how satellites in space are helping to monitor the Earths water cycle. The presentation discusses the effects of Hurricane Katrina, globalization and the ever increasing water needs of the human population.  Emma shares that there are still a few more pieces of data that NASA would like to gather and how that might be accomplished in the near future.  The presentation brings this process to life in an easy-to-understand format that kids and adults will enjoy.  This video can be easily inserted into an existing science lesson in grades 5-8 or can even be used to develop an original lesson.Technical Remarks:The presentation is provided in multiple formats, (Quicktime-  with and without captions) and can even be downloaded as a podcast as well. The creator has certainly done an excellent job in providing multiple formats to ensure that this is viewable by all.",4

3918,I love the detailed layout of the lesson plan and it leaves room for additional cycles to be added with the real world activity or need. THe presenter was very meticulous in how she wanted the information presented and it leaves no room for much error.Technical Remarks:There is not alot technical aspects of this lesson plan it is more of a resource that could be included in a upcoming science session.,5
3918,"I really enjoyed the opening paragraph that explained that students will learn and explore ways that they can conserve natural resources. It is important for students to understand why we recycle and how they personally make a difference in the world.From a pedagogical perspective, you definitely cover a variety of pedagogical strategies. From visual representations to collaboration, your project demonstrates multiple ways to engage students and make learning meaningful.I enjoy the fact that you are scaffolding the lesson by seeing what prior knowledge they may have and building off this knowledge for the remainder of the lesson.Allowing the students to have the freedom of choosing what resources they would like to present on provides a sense of independence.",5

3920,"Although I have not used this with secondary students, I have used one of the lessons in my college class. The lesson was easy to follow and a good introduction to the nature of science. This website also has a good explanation of the nature of science that can be turned into a powerpoint to explain to students.Technical Remarks:This website is used for the study of evolution. As an introduction it has an explanation of the nature of science. It also contains easy to follow lesson plans for grades K-12 in evolution and the nature of science.",4
3920,This website is a great interactive tool for students. I like that it explains different topics and allows students to test their knowledge with quizzes. I would use it in the classroom.,4

3922,"The Navigating Numbers Stories STAIR instructional design is systematic and clearly based around the learning needs of the students.  The content is presented in a simple, colorful way and is relevant to the lesson and in alignment with the teacher’s stated goals and objectives.  The teacher’s instructions prepare and guide the students and there are many opportunities for student assessment.  I personally like the colors, graphics, sound, and animation the teacher chose. They are all applicable to first graders.   The teacher’s includes many instructional strategies for a first grade math lesson that presents the concepts in different ways, such as: explanation of the concepts, providing examples, supplying vocabulary words, using charts & number lines, giving many problems for the students to solve, and including quizzes.  It is clear that the students’ developmental level is understood. She increases the level of challenges as the students’ progress through the module and varies the way that students interact with the material.   What I believe the teacher did well is create a design that will excite and motivate her first graders. She states clear objectives in the beginning and then explains the concepts the students are to learn.  She gives many examples of how to solve problems. She then gives the students many problems they must solve, which also provides ways for the students to scaffold practice. The students are required to work through the challenging problems and they are rewarded with clapping sounds and moving texts when they achieve their goals.    The module is very organized and  rellatively easy to move through. There are a few broken links and several times I became stuck on a page and had to start over. Considering the age group of the students, I would add more clip art images.  In my opinion the author did a good job of following the UDL principles. Note-I spent approximately 30 minutes viewing this project.",4
3923,"This is a wonderful lesson design for kindergarten or first grade students. The content is audience appropriate and the objective is clearly stated of differentiating between needs and wants. The multimodal (literary, non-literary, digital, and social) presentation of content reflects UDL principles and opens the material up to  a diverse group of learners with different strengths, abilities, and learning styles. Also, proper attention has been given to motivation, socialization, audience, and technology needs—which are fundamentals of good instructional design. Many technologies are used to support this lesson, which makes it usable for a wider group of instructors that may have access to only some of the technologies involved in the lesson plan. While I have not tested the effectiveness of this lesson in the classroom, I believe it would be effective because the content is relevant, the lesson incorporates strong pedagogy, and it is enhanced and supported by technology.Technical Remarks:One hyperlink is broken in the lesson plan, but otherwise everything functioned as it should.",4
3923,"The lesson aligns very well with Instructional Design principles. It starts with a clear learning objective and makes this objective clear to students. Students are given opportunities to understand the difference between needs and wants in several contexts - through literature, discussion, real world examples, and an Interactive Whiteboard activity. Including multiple representations of the content also makes the activity more accessible to a variety of learning styles.In this lesson, technology is used to support learning. More specifically, this lesson uses SmartBoard technology and the ELMO document camera to engage students. This is an effective face to face instructional strategy because it enhances a traditional lecture or discussion to become more visual and interactive.Strong and effective instructional strategies are used in this lesson, including the activation of prior knowledge, higher-level questioning, think-pair-share, and home involvement to reinforce learning. This lesson also suggests ideas to extend learning, which makes the lesson conform to Universal Design for Learning principles - the lesson is designed in a way that it is accessible to learners on many different levels.The lesson plan briefly mentions to possibility of using a digital camera to create a needs and wants video with students. This sounds like a promising extension activity. To improve this resource, I would like to hear more about the author's thoughts and experiences with this video project - specific expectations for the video, how learning would be assessed, etc. Further developing this portion of the lesson could further enhance the socialization and motivation aspects of this instructional resource.Technical Remarks:The link provided to the needs and wants Interactive Whiteboard lesson is only a .jpg image of what the screen would look like and cannot actually be used to drag and drop the items into the proper column. However, this link does provide a good visual representation to support teachers as they create their own Interactive Whiteboard file to be used in the classroom.The link to the Home Connection Worksheet does not function properly.",5

3926,"That was a very creative way of teaching physics. Physics is such a difficult subject to teach, in my opinion, so the fact that you were able to make fun, entertaining, and interesting, while delivering the point is very impressive.",5
3926,I think this is a great use of technology to teach a lesson.  The format is clean and easy to follow. You switch from video to reading which will keep kids somewhat entertained.  I like that you have a lesson and ten a quiz and a chance to try again.  I also like that you make it so students are penalized for simply rushing through and guessing the answer.  The format encourages students to actually learn and pay attention.  Switching the questions when they get one wrong is also a great tool because they again must show they read/watched/or learned what they were supposed to.  You also scaffold the lesson well from teaching a formula to applying a formula.  Great Job!,5

3929,"This is a great resource!  The lessons taught are very valuable.  I like the graphics as well as the colors and fonts.  Students should connect easily to the presentation.  Lots of great examples and a step-by-step process is a big bonus to this project.  You outline what is going to be taught, teach it, and also tell students how it will connect to their academic lives in other realms.  Awesome!When thinking about UDL, it might be interesting to consider how students might be able to visualize certain sentence structures (using video or graphics that underline or point out key words and phrases in the sample sentence).  Additionally, audio might be a great complement to this presentation.One other note: it seems that the end of the presentation is geared for an instructor-led presentation (i.e. ""look at the sentence on the board).  Students may be confused by this if they reviewed the presentation on their own.Technical Remarks:The links on slide 9 do not work.  I probably blame this on SlideShare, as it does not allow the navigation tools to work properly either (I've had the same problem).",4
3929,"In terms of ease of use, I like that this resource opens right up on the web.  It would be easy for a teacher to bookmark the site and/or direct students to the URL on any laptop or computer in order to access the activity.  Within MERLOT, the description of the activity is excellent; I felt like I knew what to expect in terms of content and age.  The presentation itself fulfilled those expectations. Within the presentation itself, I enjoyed the coloring and font choices; they seemed appropriate for the age for which the StAIR is directed.  The number of words on each slide seemed to be the right amount for the age group.  I also liked how the author includes key words to look for; I think this will help students understand and apply the principles being taught in the lesson.  There were times I wondered if complete sentences might be easier to follow.  For example, if the slide were to say “A sequence is... (1) definition #1 or (2) definition #2.”  It might depend on learner preference, however.  I liked that there was an example/quiz included within the presentation, but wished that there were more.  I might have added one example (no quiz element) after each definition.  It also seems the activity might require additional explanation by the teacher, particularly with the application to students’ learning.  That being said, I liked the integration of a group/in-class activity.   While the teacher explanation and group activity mean that it might be difficult for the presentation to be a completely stand-alone instructional resource, I think that each element works well together to meet the needs of students with various strengths and learning needs.  For instance, students should be able to work through the presentation at their own pace in class, with assistance from the teacher only if and as much as necessary.  As students finish, they could form groups for the classroom activity and have an opportunity to collaborate while applying what they’ve learned.Technical Remarks:The icons on the slides themselves did not seem to work; I tried two different internet browsers and had the same trouble on each one.  The navigation buttons beneath the slides worked, however. On slide #9 (sample sentence), the links did not seem to go anywhere.  Moving through the presentation, it seemed that they were supposed to let students know if they made the correct/incorrect choice on the self-quiz.  It also took me a minute to realize there were links there because the coloring blended in with the slide background.  Overall, the presentation seemed well thought out and, with a few slight alterations in regard to the links within the slides, could be a great tool for an elementary school class.",4
3930,"Regarding ease of use; I appreciate that this lesson plan opens right up into a Google Doc, making it easy to view, print, download or copy to a new document.The summary of the lesson plan on MERLOT is excellent.  Not only did I know what to expect, the suggestions of how to use the lesson helped me consider various scenarios as I read through the lesson plan.  This enabled me to contemplate the lesson’s use much easier than had the suggestions not been given.I like that this lesson is flexible enough that it can be used at the beginning, middle or end of a unit.  It addresses a real problem (i.e. heavy focus on fiction in ELA courses) not only by instructing students on how to recognize features in nonfiction texts, but also by enabling them to understand how they can apply what they learned to a wide range of content areas.  I appreciate the variety in tasks and assessments throughout the lessons, as it allows for students to showcase their acquired knowledge in methods that are their strengths and deepen their understanding of the content by completing assessments that may be less natural for them.I would have liked the method to be more detailed, but overall really enjoyed this lesson plan.  It seems that it will provide valuable content and has enough technology and opportunities for collaboration to fully engage students throughout its entirety.Technical Remarks:The technology use seems appropriate and as though it will enhance student learning (as opposed to adding technology for the sake of technology).  It is well thought out with multiple software/application options depending on what the school has access to.I did not have any technical issues as I worked through the lesson plan.",5
3930,"This is a great lesson plan for elementary-middle school students (5th-8th grade).  I love the interactive components with small group and whole group discussions as well as the presentation component.  When thinking about UDL, I also like the written portions that the students will create in addition to using presentation software (whether it be PowerPoint or something else).  Finally, while the students will type up their responses and share them with you, I see the potential for sharing with each other, especially if you have all students use Google Docs rather than Microsoft Word.Technical Remarks:The technology needs are well-identified and it seems like all the uses of tech will complement the lesson overall!",5

The lesson plan moves from remembering to creating and has the students working independently and in groups.. It's a nice example of project based learning with the guiding question being ""How to make informed questions for elections"". It would be nice to have a rubric for guidance and grading purposes.Technical Remarks:I like that the students will be using current tools like Prezi and that it would be easy to update for newer tools.",4

I was using PowerPoint 2007 and there is notation that the presentation was designed in PowerPoint 2010 which may have caused the issues.  I looked at the navigation numerous times and found that the presentation was set up correctly, so I am not sure what the issue was.  A couple suggestions to help you technically…  You might want to “Save As” an earlier version for those who might not have the latest release of MicroSoft Office.  Depending on if your audience is all using a school lab with 2010, or if you have a sick student who wants to view it at home with a later version might make all of the difference.  Another tip would be to disallow the user to navigate with “mouse clicks” and ONLY allow the user to navigate with your “buttons”.  When the navigation did not work for me, PowerPoint obviously used the “mouse click” navigation which took me to the wrong slides.",4
3962,"I thought the content was great; with engaging concepts for the viewer and supportive, deductive information throughout.  The learning strategies were explained at the beginning and supported through each section. Content was provided in discernible chunks and I thought the quiz examples represented the material very well.  It was helpful to have linguistic and nonlinguistic representation, and I appreciated the extra learning content that was vocalized.Technical Remarks:1.  Navigation was clunky at times, and did not always display the correct slide; sometimes I answered a quiz correctly, clicked for the next section but instead got the ""Wrong Answer"" slide.  This was mainly with the forward arrow icon, although a couple of the ""back"" icons I also jumped to pages other than the previous slide.2. I agree with the other reviewer comments on slide 2.  I can see where it is important to outline this information, but I would have preferred to view this as a link off the first (or some other) slide, instead of including it in the normal pathing. Slide 3 is also for the teacher's perspective, and should also be linked by a separate path/access.3.  The Table of Contents was very nice, and all links there worked perfectly, as did the Home icon.4.  I liked the use of colors and structure within this lesson, and it too was an example of good design.",4
3962,"I really like how well organized this resource was.  The learning goals were very well laid out and were made explicit.  In terms of the learning goals and objectives, I think maybe one page with those goals is sufficient.  Too much could get confusing for students.  One other element I am unsure of is where students would actually start the lesson.  At the very beginning there is a page for teachers only, so would you start the kids at the very beginning or a few slides in?  The narration did a great job of adding the auditory element to the information and fit within quality UDL principles.  I also really loved the visual examples throughout.  By having kids identify the elements in actual works of art, they were required to apply what they know about the design principle.  Also, I thought the examples and explanation you provided before assessing them were very clear and helpful in showing the principle at work.  I was having some trouble with some of the assessment questions.  Even though I would answer them correctly the first time, I would be taken to the page as if I answered them incorrectly.  I don’t know if the buttons were directed to the right pages.  The wrap-up at the end was great.  It tied in all the information presented in the lesson in a meaningful way.Technical Remarks:The technical aspects of this worked great.",4

The content for creating a card game using a class and collection is helpful and the analysis sections provide some information for understanding what is happening.  For the most part this article's usefulness in the classroom is minimal but may be used as a supplement or an assignment for the students to follow as a tutorial.,1
3968,"Bill - this was really well done the first time around, and now is even a little better.  You've done a nice job of tightening some language and providing some of the whys and becauses.  E.g. your extension of the ideas in the ""Handout with Music Notation"" section.  You have provided a valuable resource for other teachers here.

Nice job!",4
3969,"Jillian - The intro is better and definitely tells about what you did.  But, whenever you are doing something like this, really try to get the audiences attention.  You have a really cool lesson here and the resources are part of it.  You could talk about the books you use and why you think they were so great in this intro to.  But, the version is better than the first, and you have integrated our comments as indicated.  

Nice job.",4

3977,"This material is a spanish tutorial.  It could be used with any level just starting spanish.  The speech was very clear and timed correctly for student response.  The visuals throughout were excellent.  The clocks were easy to read and corresponded with the questions.  The background of every slide was left white so the graphics were the focus and not the background.  The background was not a distraction.  Each spoken prompt is supported by a written prompt.  By using two methods, speech and graphics, it can be utilized by more students.  Even students that can't read well, can still participate using the voice prompts.  Overall, great lesson.  This is a good idea other could build on.What a great way to learn spanish!Suggestions to make even better...Add some interactive responses throughout the show.  The listening and repeating is wonderful, but students may need something else besides just responding with speech.  Maybe through in a few multiple choice questions questions as you go.  By completing practice questions I could practice what you just taught me, it was difficult to remember everything till the end.  Also, I would like to know what the answers were to the quiz when I got them incorrect.  Not everyone knows how to use a analog clock, so as an option you could include a digital clock for the explanations too.Technical Remarks:Everything worked well.  It played all the way through.  The quiz worked well at the end.",4

The use of technology is very minimal and not really necessary except to say that it was used.Technical Remarks:No technology is needed to view this lesson, however, a few typos were found.",4
3984,"Teaching students to understand the context in which words are used is a vital skill that is often overlooked.  Having a lesson (or set of lessons) which addresses this issue is a valuable tool for students.  They need to be able to understand what they read in order to be successful learners.  Fourth grade is such a pivotal year for students because they move from learning to read to reading to read.  Having this skill will only increase their level of future success.  I am uncertain what the levels mean, but with any class, I am fairly certain this could be measured in a manner in which the teacher is comfortable.Technical Remarks:None.",4

3987,"I have referenced this site for years. I love both this site and the weekly television show associated with it. For me, the most useful material at this site are the video pieces and accompanying transcripts. Each week features up to three major stories with video pieces between 3 - 10 minutes in length. I have been able to show these in our computer equiped classroom, using RealPlayer. Each story highlighted at the site also features both internal and external links to related material.Technical Remarks:Site contains a good search feature. If you want to find videos, simply include ""watch"" in your search along with key words for your topic. Site has been updated as of Dec. 2008. Videos are now embedded within the transcript pages, more videos for older stories have been made available, many now in Windows Media Player format rather than Real Player (some still in both formats). Navigation on the new, more interactive site, does seem to be problematic and not as intuitive as the older version. Episodes before Dec. 2008 can be accessed through the archive at the site (link available on the site home page)",4
3988,I spent 20 minutes reviewing the material. The information is concise and interesting. The vocabulary easily understood and ideas are clear. The site covers most topics of importance.

The information is concise and interesting. The vocabulary easily understood and ideas are clear. The site covers most topics of importance. My students would find it very helpful. I will be able to develop higher level questions for a site such as this because the author provides some analysis.Technical Remarks: The site is easily traveled and the graphics fit the period. I would have liked to see more pictures and larger pictures so that students could get  abetter feel of the period.,5
3988,"I reviewed this site within thirty minutes. It is very insightful. It even gives hands on exercises which I tried out. They were fun, yet they gave you an insight into what the people of that time actually went through. The content is complete and accurate. This has a great potential to involve students and actually get them to learn facts from the renaissance time period. Not only is it enjoyable, it is very easy to follow. You don't have to search for what to do next or for which order to study in. The site gives you the order in which to follow and walks you through the time period.  Technical Remarks: The graphics are colorful, yet not overwhelming. ",5
3989,"This is a great resource!! It isn't much of a site, but a site where there are download files that you can import into many learning management systems that contains weekly discussion questions as well as links to external resources to get students thinking about research and thinking critically. Which is the REAL resource that has great value! There are multiple questions that can be used each week and each is customizable within your LMS. There are occasional links that are broken, so it is important to evaluate each discussion question before assigning.",5
3990,"Looks like a good site for ESL teachers and learners alike.  I will definitely try to use some of the speaking activites in the next conversation class I teach.  I appreciate seeing  ""complete"" materials which are provided for carrying out the speaking activities (role cards, suitable pictures etc.).  I can only say that I would like to see additional speaking exercises on this site as it is currently limited to three.  The ""warmer"" activities --""you can sit down if"" and ""making up excuses"" also look like good ""fun"" exercises to get the students going. The explanations are clear and the notes complete.  Lastly, this is an excellent site to recommend to ESL learners. There are several interactive computer tests that can be participated in with exercises in Grammar, Vocabulary, Reading, Crosswords, Hangman etc.  All of these can be useful to students who want to work on improving their English on their own time, outside of class.

3992,I actually used this site for teaching a three day unit.I teach high school English  Grade 11.The materials provided on this site were useful in teaching English skills to my students as they prepare to take the ACT.  The materials were current and on target for what students need to know to increase their scores on the ACT.  Students learning was enhanced which was indicated by the increase in knowledge demonstrated by the use of a pretest / posttest.  Students found it easy to navigate through the site.  They indicated that they will peruse the site on their own to further prepare for the ACT not only for the English section but also for the other three sections as well.Technical Remarks: I really appreciated how easy it was to get around in the site.  Having the opportunity to take several practice tests online was beneficial.  Students prefer working on a computer as opposed to taking paper / pencil tests.  ,5
3993,I could not get the applet to work in most of the available modes.  There are other applets available that function similarly.,2

3995,I was fascinated by this video. It does a good job of showing that science is not static but that there is still much discovery to be made. The comment he makes about middle schools at the end I thought was right on. This would be a great video for teachers and college students to watch. For high school I think AP or gate students would appreciate it.,4
3996,"This is a great idea for a music lesson. Everyone knows that scary music when they hear it, but to actually ask students to break it down into what makes it scary will allow them to try to recreate it. This lesson will definitely get all students interested and involved. It is also a great use of technology in a music class.",5
3997,A great resource. This site primarily provides text in the form of journal articles as well as an option to receive emails of latest postings. I will certainly use many of the articles in my own EDL courses.,4
3998,This website provides great research material as well as a greater understanding for science. I enjoyed reading some of the information. I also think that the visual pictures will help students out when analyzing or using the material.,4
3999,As a teacher I find it difficult to get students to get read different genres but this lesson does that and helps students make real world connections by asking very good essential questions.  I also like that students wull present to small groups which is a good way to model good presentation skills.  Great job!,4

4002,Site is great at answering why one should be scientifically literate.  Gives good examples and explanations.,4
4002,Great reference tool to expand the study of biology and to advance scientific knowledge.,4
4003,This powerpoint would work best for an older audience (upper elementary-middle school).  I like the incorporation of a video from youtube and a rap song to help explain the scientific process and reach different learning styles.  The overall design of the StAIR was very appealing and easy to use.Technical Remarks:This StAIR can only be accessed if you are able to login to Netfiles.  The link needs to be changed.,4

4006,"This document is the output of a course project that asks students to conduct a semiotic analysis. The analysis itself is very interesting and provides a good example of doing a semiotic analysis on a topic that students may be interested in: football teams. The usability is very good because the document is in Google Docs, and is therefore easily accessible to anyone who uses Google Docs. However, there are several concerns about using this as a teaching object.
1. The instructions for the actual assignment are not given, only the final output. The document refers to a ""course wiki"", but no link is given nor any text for the assignment. 
2. The output requires significant background knowledge in semiotics to understand the analysis. Background documents are referenced but not summarized in a way that is particularly effective for teaching. 
3. The document contains a survey that the students used to collect their data. However, this survey seems to be specifically aligned to the project instructions, which are not given (see 1). 
I do not see how this item could be used in the classroom as a learning tool. If the instructions for the assignment were given, then another assignment could be modeled after this one for someone teaching a semiotics class; however, with the instructions lacking, this remains a class paper with little use as a learning tool.  ",1
4007,"This is a great way to tackle a complex subject, grammar. The sentence diagrams were helpful, and so were the basic explanations (although in the initial explanation the presentation only described action verbs). The sentence diagrams are also very detailed, which is helpful to the student.However, there is an overall lack of feedback for the student. This could be a case of broken links. But, at any rate, info for the learner when they are asked to choose (click on) something would improve the presentation. The presentation could also be improved with a ""yes or no"" and an explanation why if I got it wrong for EACH question asked. Also, there were often too many links at the bottom of the page, which could confuse the student as to what link to click next. In addition, the overall color choice and design could be improved to make the presentation more appealing. Lastly, there is no use of audio in the presentation. Audio feedback with sounds or a recorded explanation throughout would make the presentation more appealing and more accessible to all students.Technical Remarks:Choice icons for questions do not appear to link to a response.",3
4007,"I found the information and diagrams very informative.  For the most part it was easy to navigate from one slide to the next.  It would have been nice if there was some kind of order to view the topics or a way to show the ones you already viewed.  I found all the buttons a bit overwhelming and could not remember which ones I already viewed.  I really liked the variety of icons you used for correct and incorrect answers.  I did not like that when you got an answer wrong there was no feedback to help you get the correct answer.  This would be very helpful especially in the quiz at the end.  Another problem I ran into was at the end of the quiz you asked ""How many questions did you get right?"".  Nothing happened when I clicked on any of the numbers.  It would be nice to have an audio option instead of just reading the information.  However, I did like the audio when you got a correct or incorrect answer.",3

Your content is good and I really like all the links you give us that lead to instructional videos. The videos offered a nice visual and audible learning strategy. The whole stair flowed very well and was easy to understand. I think that you whole stair has a inviting look to it. The colors make me more interest in the topic (soccer).

The video provides a number of examples that would then be very useful when students complete their own practice problems. It would be useful if the steps listed in the video could be more easily accessed throughout the presentation.The look of the presentation is very polished and consistent. I enjoyed that the problems started rather easy and got harder as the practice continued. Additionally I thought the presentation did a good job of addressing common algebra mistakes (such as adding terms with variables to integer terms). The video instruction was also available for reference on incorrect answers. This video addressed both visual and auditory learning.Technical Remarks:The presentation worked extremely well, no missing or faulty buttons.",4

4025,"Hi Allyson,I was really impressed with your adjective/number/gender agreement exercise.  This topic is important to new Spanish speakers as we don't use gender in English and we Spanish instructors usually need to anticipate some confusion there.  Also, this lesson is important for building solid foundation skills of Spanish grammar.  I am looking forward to using it as a portion of a future Webquest on the same topic, as an exercise within a CMS, or just as a classroom activity.I liked the fact that students could choose to get instruction and then practice the topic of their choice right away. (Number or gender.)  The instruction was short, simple, and to the point with good examples (and those pesky exceptions).  The quizzing feature was friendly, and allowed for immediate and pressure-free practice.  The quizzing also allowed for instant feedback between user and content.Some ideas for the future include:- Perhaps incorporation of even more UDL principles by adding sound (your voice?).- Addition of more examples, and inclusion of common exceptions.- Addition of fill-in-the-blank quizzing where students have to type answers and practice forming the appropriate endings.- Culminating instruction and activity which incorporates examples with both number and gender.  Putting it all together!  :-)One more thing I noticed which was very minor: When a user finishes the quiz of one area (either gender or number) I don't think the quiz gives then a hotbutton with the option of going right to the other subject.  It might be more clear to add a button with this option instead of a home button.I really liked the format and layout and believe it would be transferrable to other Spanish language subjects as well.  Nice job and thanks for sharing!Technical Remarks:Simple and easy to navigate.  Students can jump right in and walk through the content.",4

4026,"Students take their knowledge of spanish vocabulary and phrases to create a complete storybook.  After the storybook is created, the book is shared with classmates or friends.  Showing their final work could give them motivation and ownership of their creation.Concepts taught:Students will recall Spanish vocabulary.Students will apply the grammar principals we are working on.Students will demonstrate the ability to form sentences in Spanish.Also, the lesson gives tips for more advanced spanish speakers.  Grading is assess using a rubric containing 5 categories.  A technical link, is having the students use blogs or wikis to work with their stories and share them with a larger audience.Overall, great lesson! I think students would enjoy creating their own story book. This lesson could be changed to cover a variety of topics and concepts.Suggestions:Add more material for use with all levels of speakers.Include the grading rubric or at least a link to a website to create or find one.Students that struggle with writing could use a recording program or a text to speech program.   Also, final stories could be recored in a digital form.Technical Remarks:Format: PDFEasy to view",4
4027,Having a Webpage that contains instructional ideas for Special Education Teachers is a great resource.  I think some of the best ideas and instructional activities comes from professionals working in the practice.,5
4028,"This links seems to ne wrong as some others on software requirements that should be pointing to a resource and instead take to a discussion forum website.Technical Remarks:There is no checklist here, just a discussion forum",1
4028,This site is good to use once you have created a SRS document.  It helps it find any mistakes in a form of a checklist.  ,5
4029,"Hi Danielle,I liked your powerpoint. My older computer didn't want to play the videos even after you condensed it but I was able to watch them seperately on the drop down menu of your file. I thought they were good for the age group, I little older than my class or I'd use it. I would be a good for my higher thinkers because of all of the reading. I'm wondering if it could be narrated?With regards to UDL I think it provides students with an alternate means of information and provides another way of supplying knowledge that can be repeated the same way over as many times as needed. UDL 3-1 and 4-1.I think it's a good way also to minimize distractions and or feelings of shyness. UDL 7.3  An alternate form of relaying information for some students is all they might need to finally get it and this presents the information straight out. UDL 1.2-1.3. Nice work.Technical Remarks:I'd like to incorporate some of the types of buttons you had with regards to the word buttons in which the students clicked on to move forward or get more info or relay a choice. I'm not sure how that's done. Again, it was a job well done. I thought the real to life photo were a good choice because of the scientific nature of the power point.",4

4030,"Maria,I think your STAIR project is very creative and your approach to use children’s literature to promote student learning in math and technology is excellent.  I think it is awesome that you created a task that had interdisciplinary objectives which makes it much more applicable to different educators.  You definitely followed some of the UDL principles by allowing the students to engage with the project through the excel sheet, the sound clips, and the interactive slide show.  I thought you also did an excellent job of providing opportunities for the learner to always be able to go back to a previous page at any point in time through the back arrow or the tabs.  I did; however, encounter a couple of snares that I thought I should point out in case somebody else has similar problems.  The first one was that the link to the excel sheet would not open.  I tried multiple times and then decided to exit the walkthrough and just open the excel sheet which downloaded with all the files.  The next obstacle I could not overcome was the hint box in the excel sheet.  I thought the idea was great and interactive feedback would be super helpful, except that I could not open it.  I went through and even enabled my macros and it still could not get them to work.  Now this could very well be a user (myself) error, but I think it may be helpful to provide detailed directions or how to enable these the correct way.  Overall the project looked very professional and well thought out.  I would just double check these links and steps by having your students or a colleague complete them to ensure it all works.  Great job.  In reviewing your project I spent 45 minutes.Sincerely,Ethan Fahy",5
4030,This is  great presentation!,5
4031,"I really liked how this StAIR presented the content. I felt it would be good for young readers. I like the idea of the audio and video, however I could not get them to work and in some cases, I could not take the quizes. ",4
4031,I like the overall content. All the pictures are very helpful for the students.Technical Remarks:The video wouldn't work for me nor the the little sound icons.  Something you might want to change that could be helpful to the students would be taking off the mouse clicking to advance to the next slide.  That way if a student accidently clicks the mouse to advance instead of an arrow they don't get lost in the powerpoint presentation.,3
4032,"This STAIR project provides multiple means of representation where text, images and videos were presented to the learner. In most areas, test your knowledge tool was provided where students get to practice what they  learned. When they get an incorrect answer, I think it would be useful to have some explanation. I know that this lesson is for upper elementary students, but I think it would be useful to add audio in order to reach all types of learners. Fonts, images, animations, and transitions... the overall appeaance of the pesentation was very easy to view and read.  Overall, it was a great presentation.Technical Remarks:Videos worked.",4
4032,"This is a good introduction to the elements of art for middle school students.  As this presentation states, the elements are the “ingredients” of a work of art.  Having a solid understanding of not only what these are, but all of the information specific to each one is an important part of any young artist’s art education.  Of course, constructing a presentation that delves deeply into each of the elements of art would be massive and would take a long time to navigate through much less create.  This presentation would be a good jumping off point when introducing them to a class and it is easy to imagine that other StAIR presentations that address each of the elements individually could be shown to the students in the days/weeks that follow.Technically the presentation works though I could not play the videos.  The slide layouts were nicely arranged with text that was clear and easy to read.  It’s always good to see images of art work created by artists that the students may be studying as the school year progresses.  Presentations like this one are wonderful tools to share those works of art with students.  It looks like there may be some images of student work in this presentation as well.There are a couple points that might need to be addressed before sharing this tool with students.1.	Some of the graphics are partially covering up some of the text on some of the slides (Slides 1 and 14).2.	The videos did not play for me.  I wish I knew how to solve this because I had a similar issue with a StAIR that I created.  If I figure out why this didn’t work in my presentation maybe I’ll check back in here and share my soloution.3.	I think it would be good to put some information about each of the works of art featured in this presentation.  The names, dates, dimensions and even mediums used in each piece would be good to share even if that information isn’t necessarily what this presentation aims to teach the students specifically.4.	It might be a good idea to add some kind of text to speech features for students who are struggling readers.Technical Remarks:Video doesn't work (for me).",4
4033,"This project was a little hard to access. A ""unzipping program"" was required to get to the powerpoint.  Once in th presentation a good explaination of how to move forward and back were there.  Especially in a foreign language, pronuncation is very important.  These words were clickable, so that sound file played.  The video from Youtube embedded was a nice touch as well, students really like little clips to break up the clicking.It was quite easy to use, although it was unclear what exactly the backward icon was.  I found the font used throughout to be a little hard to read, maybe just use it for titles, then something easier on the eyes for the rest of the text.Technical Remarks:Because I could download and open this presentation, I could see that there was many review questions at the end, but....when in slide show, there is no way to get from 1 to any of the others, this needs to be fixed for students to show more of what they learned.",3
4033,Excellent! Check out this neat presentation on El Dia de los Muertos!,5
4034,I would love to join your class Kate. I am very interested in the STAIR lesson. phoodle I think it will be very interesting.,5
4034,I thought this was a very engaging and interactive stand-alone. The audio and review components are done very well. The photos in the presentation  really are visually fun!One area that might students while thinking about the blog they will write is to add a review slide near the end so the quality items are fresh in their mind before they start to compose their own blog. Maybe even a links or examples of blogs written by other students their age as an idea what an active blog looks like. This would help some of your more visual learners. ,4
4034,"Great scaffolding of content. Graphics, visuals and auditory elements were nice features and didnt cloud the content. I like how you offer students the ability to master the concepts on this Stair by allowing them to revist the quiz. Technical Remarks:Nice Job.",5
4034,"Katie, I enjoyed looking through this STAIR.  I can definitely see it being a useful resource for students just getting started.  The STAIR has a fresh look and is easy to navigate.  I like the progression of activities and teaching tools--video, quiz, examples, have students try it out, etc..The video was very cute, but I wonder if middle grade students would find it a bit elementary - with the panda and younger students giving the information.  Great resource.  I'll have to have my students blog so I can use it!",5
4034,"Hi Katie -I think this is an excellent Stand Alone resource!  It is very clear, easy to navigate and I appreciate that on Slide #2 you really describe the details of what the students will learn upon completion of the session.  I thought the, ""How do I write a quality blog post?"" video was excellent.  However, you might want to change the title of Slide #4 to be, ""How do I write a quality comment on a blog post?""  Are your students in the video or is it a resource you found online?  I would be interested in knowing where it is posted if it is a resource open to the public.  The embedded video drives the lesson (in clear, helpful, playful, accessible way) and your follow-up questions are good.  If a student gets a question wrong, he/she is sent back to ""try again.""  I wonder if this would contribute to a student simply clicking another choice without fully understanding why it is wrong in the hopes of then getting it right.  Do you think a wrong answer might be an opportunity to make a slide that reminds the student of the rule or is demonstrated with an example.  Obviously this would require a lot more slides, but might be something you want to consider.  This StaIR also looks like an excellent lesson in general.  I wonder if you have had the opportunity to see how the students learn the material from an instructor vs. the online stand alone resource.  It seems like it would be good for a ""flipped classroom"" assignment where the students use the StaIR for homework, and then come prepared to review and get started with the work of commenting on blogs.Great job!~ Leslie",5
4034,"The slides were very clear, not cluttered with a lot of graphics.  A great idea to give those taking the quiz the option to go back and reveiw the video and that there's a link to a blog where more information can be obtained.",4
4035,"The author has a lot of resources available for students regarding post-secondary options.  There are many links to videos and websites with applicable information throughout.  However, the manner that is presented has some technical flaws and lacks in applying UDL principles.  The greatest hindrance is that it does not provide meaningful feedback to users about their performance.  In fact for every question it tells the user that they got the question both right and wrong!    It also is limited in providing multiple means of representation.  For students who have limited English proficiency or visual problems, there are little supports in place for them.  Some slides are very text heavy and do not provide an audio component to support these students.  Furthermore, vocabulary is not always clearly defined.Technical Remarks:The author embeds links to videos and a worksheet throughout the presentation.  The link to a SmartGoals worksheet on Slide 3 does not work.  A pop-up message comes up saying “Cannot open the specified file.”  There is a quiz embedded in the tutorial.  The first two questions are short answers and therefore the user does not input any response into the system.  Despite this, the presentation goes to the next screen of a page that says “That’s right! Great job!” When you click the next button after that you go to a screen that says “Not quite right!”  It gives the user the option to go back to the question or to see the answer.  Therefore, the navigation is very confusing and doesn’t make sense.   The 3rd question is a multiple choice, however, it does not give students the option to choose one of the answers on-screen.  There is simply a next button that again goes to a “That’s right! Great job!” screen and then a “Not quite right!” screen.  When you click the back arrow on the screen with the 3rd question’s answer, it takes you to the answer of a question that has not even been posed yet.  A similar pattern continues throughout the quiz.  In the second half of the presentation, the student is to explore career options.  On one of the pages they are presented with 8 videos and 11 website links.  Although these links may be useful, the number is very overwhelming and most high schoolers probably will skip this page altogether.  If you accidentally click on the screen rather than one of the link buttons, it takes you to the next slide. Again there is a quiz that has the same issues as the first one.",2
4036,"This StAIR is fantastic! From the standards and directions at the beginning and continuing throughout the entire presentation, this StAIR is extremely complrehensive. You can tell that alot of time and energy was given to creating this lesson. I beleive that the students will be immediately engaged and will have fun completing this lesson. I would recommend this to any teacher and I would use it in my own classroom if I taught math...Great Job!Technical Remarks:Technically sound lesson. I found no issues or problems anywhere in this StAIR",5
4036,"This is a great StAIR.  It is very easy to navigate and the immediate feedback provided during each section was amazing.  Students and teachers will be able to quickly gage their understanding of fractions and should allow corrections to be made immediately.  The StAIR also immediately identifies the benchmarks and standards covered within it right at the beginning, allowing teachers to quickly assess if this particular StAIR is what they were looking for.  I loved it!",5
4036,This is an outstanding resource! This will be something you can tweak and change as the technology changes.Technical Remarks:Everything works great!,5
4037,"Awesome!!! This is a great supplemental tool! Multiple means of respresentation including alternatives for visual information (video) as well as providing alternatives for auditory information. This tool also provides different ways of interacting with the material. I appreciate that the questions were built right into the middle of the material so that kids can ""test""what they have learned so far.  I think adding the ""keep learning""...to the end was a great way to extend academic discovery. I also like the assement tool that checks answers.Technical Remarks:Some of the sound effects did not work when clicking on the answers.  Alos, on the page with two videos, there was not a way to click out of the video or collapse from the large screen.  If you did not already know how to just hit ""ESC"", you might feel frustrated.  Overall, technically this was a great StAIR.",4
4037,"This is a well thought out concept that is put together in a STAIR for students to guide themselves through. This is a difficult concept and while introduced in 3rd grade, would be a great lesson to use with almost any grade. I may have learned a few things myself! I did have difficulty viewing some of the videos. I am not sure if it was my computer that wasn't working or the video itself. I do like the feedback it gave when students answered correctly or incorrectly, the simple sound effects make a difference to 3rd graders. I think a few of the questions were wordy and some may have trouble with them. But I think they were similar to what studnets may see on standardized tests so it may be good practice for them. There were many visual opportunities to hear and see the concept being taught and was backed by immediate quetions and feedback which is a great advantage to using a STAIR. Overall, I highly recommend this lesson and look forward to using in my classroom this upcoming year. I think it will be a great lesson to display on the smartboard in small groups to allow for discussion as well as using indivudally.",5
4037,"This was a great topic, and I think you integrated your resources really well. Imbedding videos and pictures into the powerpoint makes it easier to navigate.  Including recordings of the text also helps to keep your struggling readers engaged.  I liked the self-correcting answers as well.  The layout was very clean, and easy to read the information. Nice job!Technical Remarks:I got stuck on slide 3 after clicking view video.  I did not see an option to continue on, and had to go back to the powerpoint and select a slide.  Not sure if something happened to the button.  An option to go back, or a main menu would also be helpful for learners who want to review a specific topic. ",4
4037,"This presentation would be a great tool to use not only in a 3rd grade classroom but for anyone interested in the basics of Earths importance. It is cute, engaging and definitely informative. The videos were very helpful, especially with the different videos presented by Brain Pop Jr. Brain Pop Jr. is a great resource to use for students at that age. The design of this presentation was also created perfectly with the content it was emphasizing. I enjoyed the slides with difference planets on them that also included their colors. The audio used within this presentation is an excellent way to aid diverse learners. Students have a visual infront of them while also listening to it being said. This presentation gives multiple resources for students to use in order demonstrate their knowledge after they complete the interactive power point. This wwas also a great way to give students a choice and have them apply their learning in different ways.Technical Remarks:I felt that this presentation was very easy to move through. It is definitely user friendly and its design makes students excited about learning. One thing I would reconsider is putting in a ""review information,"" option somewhere while answering the questions. Instead of students 'guessing' the answer, they have an option to re-read what they learned. I also think it would be helpful to those students who may need a guide while answering questions. Overall, I think this will be a great resource to any classroom!",5
4037,Very nice presentaion with various opportunities for differential learning.  My 3rd graders love Brain Pop Jr. - good choice for the video clips. The content was at grade level and would keep the students interest.  Technical Remarks:The presentation was easy to read and navigate through.  You may want to add back buttons for the students that like to re-read information.  Using the black background for a presentation on planets was a good choice! ,4
4037," It is a great tool for 3rd graders to learn about Earth and its place in space, as the title cleverly suggests.  There are a lot of pictures and appropriate videos that are appealing to younger learners.  It is elementary friendly and broken down into segments.  This resource starts off with easy questions and then moves to harder concepts.  It is scaffolded in a logical order.  After each concept, there are a series of questions to quiz the students over each concept.  It would be nice for students who don’t do well on the questions, to have a link to go back to the video to review.  Overall, this presentation is a great tool to use after discussing the concept in class.  It is ideal for reinforcing previously learned material in a new way. Technical Remarks:This presentation was easy to use and watch.  The links to each slide are easily found and utilized, but it would be better to save this presentation as a .pps instead of .pptx so students are not able to edit the slides.The presentation is presented in many different formats for varied learners.  Questions are available in audio as well as text.  There are also great graphics, pictures, and videos to present the concept.  It would be nice to see an interactive map where students have to identify Earth and/or surrounding planets by clicking on the planets.  This would help to address the kinesthetic and visual learners.  When clicked, a recording of the planet’s name could be prompted as well to address kinesthetic, auditory, and visual learners! There are many great extras in this presentation that will make it more meaningful and fun for the students!",4
4038,"I like your use of inductive instruction with the presentation!  When it comes to grammar rules in my French classes I always prefer to teach it this way so the students have the chance to figure out the rules on their own rather than just writing it on the board and telling them.  I really enjoy that ""ah hah"" moment they get when they figure out the rules.  Also I think its great that you threw in some celebrities they will recognize as well!",4
4039,"Good simple resource. It was light, fun, and engaging. The content was basic but still a complete learning resource for young students. The pictures, video, and music made the resource more enjoyable.Technical Remarks:I would like the resource to have ""back"" buttons. I would prefer the video embedded in the resource. And I wish the forward buttons were always in the same spot, but that might just be my preference.",4
4039,"Very simple and easy to use. I does a decent job demonstrating simple matter properties. It is short and sweet and to the point.Technical Remarks:The issue may have been with my mac, but certain buttons only moved the slides forward. They did not allow the student to return to previous pages or ""home.""",4
4039,This resource is simple and fun.  It can be used to help students develop an understanding of what object sink and which float. Using this resource students should grasp these ideas and be able to make the technology function.  I found the resource description in MERLOT especially useful because of the included detail.  I wish more MERLOT content had such rich descriptions.  The resource itself is quite simple and as such might be something on wihch to build.,4
4039,"This was a cute slideshow on ""Sink or Float"" dealing with the science of Matter, although lacked a few basic elements to make it more effective.The lesson needed lots more images.  Since this is a 1st grade lesson, students need that visual stimulous to learn more effectively. All of the arrows should be placed at the bottom of the screen. Some of the language is above a 1st grade level, and a little more clarification of what the letters ""SWBAT"" stood for would have been nice. I was confused as to where to click for the ""terms to know"" section. I think for this lesson you need to say, ""click on ""solid"" to find out more about it., etc. I did like the YouTube video.  It was age appropriate and fun to watch. The quiz was alright, but I think I would place more pics on these two pages also. The content of the lesson was interesting and science related. Technical Remarks:You should have ""back buttons"" on all pages and a ""back button"" should replace the pic of the ""home"" icon. For the page with the YouTube video, most kids would click in the middle of the image on the page, but if you do that nothing happens. The link only works if you click on the outer area of the box.",3
4039,"There are no technical problems with this activity; everything seems to be in great shape.  Fun lesson.The only negative features of this is that it is very text heavy.  I teach first grade, and although properties of matter is something that we teach (thus I could use it), it wouldn't be an independent activity.",4
4040,"As a teacher in a language center I can appreciate the need for such a resource.  Students need instruction in a number of different venues for  understanding and I see where linguisticly challenged students would benefit from your StAIR.  I wonder if creating three different projects would be a little more beneficial.  The information could be scaffolded for students that still are struggling with the concept of Plagerism, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing.  I liked the additional feature of the practice citation simulation.  I think an additional StAIR could be created just using that topic also.  I am concerned with the text heavy slides.  Could the addition of audio for second language learners be used to scaffold instruction?  It would also add additional UDL principles into the presentation.  You address the needs of the students by giving clear directions on each slide, an additional feature that would address clarity would be to keep the same formatting for each set of directions.  Some slides were text heavy and the directions blended together. I understand the need for the heavy instructional slides but could you add video lectures at some points or in addition to what you have presented in a text format.  The teacher and student directions set clear expectations and I believe you achieve your goal for the lesson.  Your examples supported the material content, and gave the learner an opportunity to try using the new learning on their own.  Overall, the StAIR supports second language students in the use of identifying Plagerism, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing techniques.  Technical Remarks:To further the language acquisition pedagogy of speaking, listening, reading, and writing of learning a new language you could add voicethreads strategically throughout your presentation to aid students in understanding.  An additional UDL support could be using small video clips of the readings to reach auditory learners.  I did not have any problems navigating within your project and all links took me to the correct areas.",4
4041,"I really enjoyed this presentation. It is interactive and has a great check and redirect component for review and mastering of the grammar concepts. I really liked the funny play on the sentences when the commas were missing or in the wrong spot.One area that might be helpful to add is the pen tool so students can mark the sentences where they think the comma might before they select an answer, this would help your visual learners. Sometimes it helps to see it before committing to the answer. ",5
4041,"If one can laugh through a grammar drill, you have created a successfull lesson! I like how it appeals to a mulitude of learning styles and how you are teaching to mastery level by giving students the ability to take the quiz as many times as they want. Technical Remarks:Nice Job. ",5
4041,"Hi Kelly –This is an excellent resource! To model the sentences with a voice over really demonstrates how a sentence can be misunderstood without the correct punctuation. I thought your examples were clear and concise.  Using both audio (voice over) and text supports the UDL principals of multiple ways to engage diverse learners and will likely improve understanding of the material.  It is clear that this stand-alone is for your student audience specifically, but I would highly recommend it to others.  Other teachers would need to adapt or give modifying instructions to their students.Comments: 1) Put your name on the cover slide.  Although you reference that the material is taken from a text book, you should at minimum state, “Materials presented by: Kelly Hanson.”  You might also want to include: your title, grade and subject area.2) After you read the paragraph aloud on slide number 4, I immediately clicked the arrow button to the next slide.  However, just as I was leaving the page, I heard you start to say more.  When I clicked the “back” button, the audio was no longer available, so I started over.  You might want to also type the text and record, “You’re going to continue on your own now.”3) I specifically choose to get the answer wrong several times to see where we would be directed.  When I got an answer wrong towards the end of the series, I was sent all the way back to the beginning (and then back through the questions I had already completed).  You might want to duplicate the appropriate “review the rules,” slides to have the students keep moving forward.Great job!",5
4041,"Great resource for using commas correctly!  I love some of the humorus examples of how incorrect comma usage can completly change the meaning of a sentence.  I think that would be very effective in keeping the learner involved.  I also like that fact that during the quiz poriton of the lesson that you can't go on to the next question until you have answered it correctly.  This is an important tool that can't be realized with a pencil and paper.Technical Remarks:Most everything looked great.  On question number three in the quez section, the question overlapped the border of the background.",5
4042,Good site for learning about real world performance gauging.  Lots of different links to different types of performance testing.,4

These people are one of the biggies that do it so there is the reasoningTechnical Remarks: This site is technical in the aspect that it needs to be for its job.  Also there is definitions and explanations of what they are.  They have made effort in their site to be understood by the layman.,5
4042,"Website of the very popular SPEC tools used to benchmark computers. The problem is that marketing ""geniuses"" can still skew the data to fool consumers into believing that their product is the best.",4
4043,"I found this website to be very useful and extremely easy to use. The format of the site is very plan which adds to the ease of use. By simply clicking on a state, there is a plethora of information that would be beneficial for any user. A user can choose from over 60 subgroups ranging from state capital, state bird, state song, surrounding states, the geographical location, the state flag, the highest point, and nickname just to name a few. I viewed about 15 states and it seems like any link I chose was working properly, so basically I did not come across any dead links. There is definitely more information than probably necessary for this site but you never known what some people are searching for, so having everything in front of you is a plus. All the links connect to relevant and useful sites.Using this as a teaching tool would be very effective. A teacher could assign each student a state and have the student report on key characteristics of their state. The student can then report their findings during a presentation. I think this would be a fun activity for the class and it would introduce useful information. It is important that all citizens of any country know the demographics and at least the state capital of each state. You would be surprised by the number of people who do not know their state capitals for the US. The Internet offers resources that were not available 10-15 years ago that students can use and I think this website is a must for any teacher looking for a useful technological medium for introducing the states to a class.Technical Remarks:As I said earlier, the site is very easy to use and I had no trouble navigating the site. This is beneficial for young students who may not have a grasp of the Internet. They can simply click on a state and stick to it without getting lost with dead links. And if they do get lost they can simply hit the HOME button on the bottom of each page.",4
4044,"This lesson is a great resource! The author does a great job at ""checking in"" on the student's knowledge. The reinformaent is also a great point. I really like the balloon clip art that fills in as they go. PERFECT for 2nd graders! The font size is acceptable.  Lots of pictures add to the connecting to the three states of matter. 2nd graders may not know what carbon dioxide is, but the visual aids them in understanding that it is in fact a gas. Technical Remarks:No Broken Links :) ",5

4048,"The author provides an easy navigation tool to a variety of writing topics. The ideas are concisely shared in clear writing. With writing, finding ways to illustrate grammatical and writing tips other than through lots of words can be helpful when working with those struggling with writing. In other words, the more we can do through means other than just a narrative text, the greater the possibility students will use the material.",3
4049,"Jessica,Excellent presentation. Clear, concise and focused. I'm going to create another StAIR modeled on your format. I reviewed your presentation for approximately 30 minutes. It incorporates the UDL principles and is very user-friendly.Sharon  :)",4
4049,"This lesson is a great way to help students learn how to summarize what they have read. The articles in the lesson are very age appropriate and would grab students' interest.Technical Remarks:There is a word missing on the forth slide. Also, it might be a good idea to have students answer the final set of questions on their own and make their own summary on the last article instead of showing them the answers. ",5
4050,"After 1/2 hour on this site, I learned a lot about Threads. I've looked at a LOT of Java textbooks, and this site beats them all for writing style, correctness and completeness.Technical Remarks: Java is a large, difficult subject. Therefore, one should expect a tutorial in it to take a while to get used to. Such a powerful tool for learning is worth spending an hour or so learning how to use. I have found that textbook references to the Java language also take time to understand their organization.",5
4050,"While this is the most widely-used tutorial, I found it's overall structure to be confusing.  I would often end up following links until the point where I was not sure where I was.  ",3
4051,"The site provided ways to use technology to help people communicate however, in the real world it is not that simple.  A student who has no real world experience with these devices not only has to teach the patient but the family and the staff.  The site does not help with the ""buy-in"" that is needed for the use of technology to be truly useful.  This is the main reason I would be hesitant to use it in the classroom as a teaching tool.On the positive side, it does give plenty of ideas for laser points, eye gaze and other non-traditional ways to use communication boards with our patients who are otherwise unable to use devices.        Technical Remarks:good quality - the presentation was also available in PDF and or TXT formats for download. ",3
4052,I appreciated this material for the clarity with which it presented items that should be in a syllabus. I wouild have liked more detail on how to present some of these items - formatting that makes it more student-friendly etc.,4
4053,"This project is set up very well.  There are a lot of visual aids as well as audio to help the learner learn/review these different types of symbols. The layout and design are not intimidating to the learner.  I was not overwhelmed with information.  The links were a very helpful supplement to the audio to help understand the material.  Overall I think students would definitely benefit from this projectTechnical Remarks:Great use of links, didn't rush the student",4
4053,"This StAIR is well put together with a large amount of information that is subdivided well.  The large amount of lecture text is reinforced with a reading by the author at a pace that is deliberate and measured.  I like the structure of lecture information for one section followed by an evaluation question.  All the answers to the questions give rich feedback to the student. The use of images is particularly deft, not only complimenting the information, but visually carving up the large amount of text.Technical Remarks:Compatible with my copy of Office 2008 for Macintosh (thanks!)",4
4054,"I believe the author did an excellent job in terms of demonstrating his knowledge base in the area of copyrighting. The author power point was very structured, organized and detailed. He kept the reader’s interest through the design of the presentation, as well as the ease of understanding the information despite the topic being one that is very detailed and critical. The quiz in the presentation allowed the reader the opportunity to ensure that they understood the concepts in the powerpoint presentation. I failed the quiz on the first two tries and was eager to make sure that I obtained the correct answer. I feel that Marcus took time in choosing an important yet easy topic to understand and relate to. Utilization of the powerpoint presentation was the best way to relay this information to readers at different developmental levels. His presentation was very insightful and thought provoking. I feel that I have obtained a better understanding of the laws regarding copyright infringement after reading his presentation. This presentation has sparked my curiosity to learn more about this area.",5
4054,"The attractive, standard template used throughout this tutorial makes it one that is easy to navigate through from the very start through the end- the author has chosen fonts, colors, and slide backgrounds, doing a fine job of customizing the display of information for the learner. The author has also made a point to highlight the big ideas and key learning objectives to the learner in the very beginning of the tutorial, guiding them to effective goal setting. As a learner, I now know what I am aiming to accomplish by the end of the tutorial.Other “pros” of this tutorial include the author defining and decoding symbolic notation that the learner is expected to soon be very familiar with. By providing multiple meanings/interpretations of the symbols, it enhances the relevance and authenticity for the learner, as they are able to create their own meaningful connection for each given copyright tag. Another strategy the author uses in this tutorial is a “quiz” question feature they occurs after every/every other new copyright is introduced. These short assessments enhance the learner’s capacity for monitoring their OWN progress as they are instantly told whether or not they comprehend the new information; the author has also incorporated audio to affirm their selection. One other bonus to the “quiz” assessments throughout the tutorial is that they give the learner instant feedback- an important criterion for effective self-monitoring of progress. If the learner chooses an incorrect answer, they are provided with a scaffold, or reminder of the key information that was studied prior.One way this tutorial might be enhanced for ALL learners is to provide the learner with an “everyday” example of a way that each copyright license is commonly used, and also, the kind of person/job that generally uses each type. I feel as though it may be beneficial for the author to even further activate background knowledge of the learner in the beginning of the tutorial- of course depending on the audience’s familiarity with copyright knowledge. As an example, being an individual that doesn’t know much about the topic, or why or what one would seek a copyright license for, I did a little more research on “creative commons” and learned that, in general, things that are copyrighted are: books, scripts, websites, lesson plans, blogs and any other forms of writings; photographs and other visual images; films, video games and other visual materials; musical compositions, sound recordings and other audio works. (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing) This type of information may have helped “set the stage” more having known this information from the start.Overall, this tutorial was informative and I especially found it helpful to see a “graphic organizer” of all that I had just learned at the end of the presentation. Well done!Technical Remarks:The link to the correct answer of the first quiz question is broken.",4
4055,I think this lesson would really get students into this learning about the stars.  8th grade students would really be engaged.  I wish my 8th grade teacher would have done an activity like this with our class.,5
4055,A very fun and hands on way to introduce students into the joys of star gazing.,5

4055,"""Wow"" is right.  I couldn't imagine taking on a project of that magnitude but it seems like so much fun!  Makes me want to teach astronomy.  I think it would be an excellent tool to reach kids, especially those in earth science/astronomy who either take it because they have to or because they think it might be an easy grade.  Puts a whole new emphasis on the class.",5
4056,"A good site to visit and to use in order to learn English by movies in th e English learning classroom, the only problrm I think could be possible is the cost that it has, despite it's just one dollar, there must be somebody unable to pay that amount of money.-Technical Remarks:Easy access to the site,there are good graphics and image quality and the links are related to the contents. Up to date films and quite good extracts of movies.-",4
4056,"As an English Language Arts teacher, I am often looking for ways to connect videos to literature. This site offers many resources for over 270 movies. The site is easily explored and has resources for all subjects and all grade levels. I plan to subscribe for new ideas regarding my Romeo and Juliet unit.",4
4056,"I used this site to develop lesson plans using movies in courses designed for students with disabilties. Each lesson and related activities was based on viewing 15 to 20 minute segments of movies and the following up with a series of questions, discussion, and related writing assignments.  I found this a great way to engage students and to allow them to meet course objectives in courses titled, Self Esteem, Career and Job Planning, and Transition to Independent Living.Technical Remarks:Understanding TEACH Act and fair use and copyright implications are critical if you intgrate movies into your classroom work with students.

4057,This is a great place to find useful teacher made materials for teaching pre-school through higher education.,4
4058,Great work Bob!  Again another lesson that I will be stealing from you to use with my students.  I completely relate to the problem you identified.  Too many History teachers/classes fouce on names and dates instead of causes and factors that led up to these events.  ,5
4058,"Good stuff. I find myself making similar websites for my personal use to have ""all my toys in the same box"" to use for lessons. I also like the focus of putting facts into context instead of simply listing them. Especially with the WWI section, this proves very valuable and insightful.",4
4059,Excellent study tool.,5
4060,Very VERY informative site! What I appreciated most was the way the information is given; it reaches across many levels of reading comprehension. The way the page is layed out flows very nicely and keeps your attention the whole way through without being dry.

The author uses a language that is very clear and communicative.,5
4061,"This site has a tour of the body systems,and various experiments that the learner can try at home. It also has a section about weather, with live weather updates from Science Bob's headquarters in Newton, MA. The site is easy to navigate and is child friendly.",4
4062,Good information about a vital topic.  Discussion guidance at the end is a plus.,4
4063,There are many good resources here. I found a simulation showing natural selection with the peppered moths of England. This is a good example of natural selection and the simulation makes it easy for the students to understand.,4
4064,"This StAIR was very well thought out and detailed. I thought it did a wonderful job covering the different verb conjugations. I actually learned a few things going through it!  It was also very organized and attractive. It looked very professional. I liked that the StAIR gave the user options as well. This would fall under the UDL principles because no matter which verb ending the student struggled with, this StAIR covered them all.Technical Remarks:I think adding some sound effects would do wonders. Also, I noticed that on some of the quiz questions that the word was behind the action button; you couldn't read it. Other than that I believe everything was functioning as it should.",5
4064,"Your StAIR was very detailed, and I liked how it was broken up into different sections, so the students could choose which section(s) to cover based on their needs.  One suggestion would be to include a brief explanation for students when they get something wrong, rather than just having them go back and try to answer it again.  Then you might end up with a student who just randomly clicks until they get it right (which is what I did, and afterwards, I couldn't have told you which one was the right one, or why).",5
4065,"I spent about 5 minutes browing it and it only took me couple minutes to find out about the material! It presents concepts and models as well.  This is great for anyone who is willing to learn about the world. This site will help both students and teachers to enhance their learning skills.   It was my first time visiting the site, and I found it very easy to use!!  ",4
4065,"If someone can think it, there is a website out there devoted to it.  People travel to all lengths of the world with GPS (Global Positioning Systems) units in search of whole number latitude and longitude locations.  Pictures from North, South, East, West, and GPS are then posted to the site for all to see.Technical Remarks: Great Ease of navigation with no dead links to speak of.  Quality of pictures posted are outstanding and viewable from various perspectives.  This site is all volunteer run so you are not overwhelmed with ads.",4
4066,I spent several hours exploring this site.  It is alarming to realize the rate that young people are committing suicide.  Many sad stories are here to read.

This material is a great piece that clearly defines science and it's nature.  Anyone who struggles with the idea of what science is should read this... easy read... great content!",4
4078,"I spent several minutes reviewing this site.  The content seems very instructive-right at a level that I can understand (not being of a scientific background this is important). The materials are easy to read and follow.Technical Remarks: This would be an excellent site for students and teachers to use to understand the ""Ozone Hole"".  First itme users should find it fairly easy to use.",4
4078,"I spent 12-15 minutes at the site, and the quality of the content and graphics is excellent.  The site is very easy to navigate with a lot of good instruction in how to make the most of the site.  The use of movie clips to show actual and computer modeling of the ozone layer allows the authors to convey very difficult information so that the layperson can understand it.  Also, the use of glossary links helps the layperson get needed additional information about specialized terms and significant people in the study of the ozone layer.  This site would be very useful in both high school and college science classes.",5

4082,"Again you did a really nice job! It looked very polished. I really liked the videos. They were simple, short, and easy to follow. I also liked your rock cycle visual and the clapping sound the added to the quiz section. My only suggestions would be to add more visuals in the begining and consider giving the learner more feedback on why certain answers are incorrect. Other than that it was really well done!Technical Remarks:All the technology looked good!",5
4083,"The Power point presentation shared articulated an action plan for infusing or promoting MERLOT at Univ. of Michigan. Although it provided a good scenario of possible challenges and highlights, it is specific to the identified school. It may prompt some to think about promoting MERLOT globally and by offering guidance or an outline for establishing a committee to consider the use of MERLOT.Technical Remarks:The PPT was extensive and time consuming to read. The inclusion of audio may help to create a more engaging presentation that deters the audience from having to read a lot of text.",3
4085,Great website! Has fun activities to do with the students!,5
4086,"This is a good outline of your project, but you may want to be more specific with your resources. Give the name of the video and maybe a link to where we can buy it (amazon), since it's a main step in your lesson. ",4
4086,"This resource is easy to follow and use. The problem or need is stated very clearly, and sets up the document effectively for the real world experience. Here the students see the purpose of solving the problem.  The instructional objectives are clear and direct. This lesson is very streamed lined and concise.  I find the use of a Google document and video during this lesson exciting, since it gives the students the opportunity to collaborate with their peers and others.I would like to see the 7th graders provide feedback to each other as they talk about the thesis statement they are thinking of. Also, it would be nice to see the stages of writing the thesis and a way to monitor their progress. Technical Remarks:Not applicable",4
4087,"I have used this with classes for several semesters, and they and I both enjoy it a great deal. The ability to search for a character's name and locate the chapters in which he or she appears would make the app worth downloading even if one did not care about the pronunciations at all. Technical Remarks:I don't think there is an Android equivalent, but I'm not too familiar with Android.",5
4088,"Fun website. Easy to move around, great for beginning water cycle.",4
4089,"I am glad to see you are introducing your freshmen to Google docs. You hit the nail on the head about using these skills throughout and after high school. It is also very important for them to learn proper collaboration etiquette.  I see several teaching strategies, such as graphic organizers, cooperation, complex tasks,  and by teaching your lesson this way, the students will definitely be engaged. I am wondering a few things about your lesson plan. How would you handle students with vision or hearing issues? If they are chatting online, hearing issues are not an issue, but vision would be. And the opposite goes for hearing issues if they are not able to chat online. I am also wondering if this is a group project or will each student do their own character map at the end? You say they will collaborate, but how will they turn in the final product, multiple names for one paper or several papers with similar ideas due to collaboration? I do like the way you will give them feedback, it gives Google docs more value to them.I would have liked to see how you would teach the actual character mapping, and not just he Google docs training. This is a great start and I can see you using this over and over again (or until they learn GD in middle school!)Technical Remarks:I don't see any major technical problems with this lesson plan.",3

I liked the clear explanation of each slide, especially the quiz questions. Your StAIR project is very detailed. All the links and resources worked properly and all of them were very informative. The sound effects were fun and properly used. I liked all the pictures; it made your StAIR presentation interesting. I think you met instructional strategies really well.",5
4096,Clear explanation of vocabulary and the origin of the word “Hurricane”.  Great resources for access to more information about hurricanes.

I wouldn’t mind seeing a picture of the God “Hukrane” !!,5
4097,"I enjoy how this lesson makes good use of images and text sizes/boldness to draw attention to the information being delivered.  Key terms are defined and words are explained so that students will not have as many issues with trying to interpret those descriptors.  The reviews are helpful in making sure that you haven't missed anything before you build on that scaffolding.  The quizzes also have feedback on why answers are right or wrong, which can help students to better build their skills with a chance to re-take quizzes if they didn't feel great after finishing.  One good touch to the lesson is that the arrows to proceed are scattered.  This ensures that anyone taking the lesson can't just click through it!  Once the students are done it is also nice that they have a copy of the notes.",5
4097,"This is a nicely done lesson.  I like the simple backgroud and complimenting colors you chose.  You did a nice job fully explaining the different types of clauses.  I especially liked the way you used analogy to connect this difficult to explain topic to real life.  That definitely made it clear.  Your scaffolding was also well done.  By defining the terms first and then providing examples, you give the students a chance to bite off small pieces.  I will definitely be able to use this in class.",5

Providing detail on what DropBox can do, how it can be applied to share files, and alleviate problems and improve communication and collaboration is well stated with this application and lesson.The author of this lesson plan was able to incorporate UDL into the lesson, such as providing one on one training, sharing a questionaire on google docs, a link to a camtasia movie, and providing closed captioning to the movie.Overall, this a great lesson plan and provides a great solution to a need.",5
4109,"The resource had a readable and much organized flow to it. All ideas and principles were clearly stated. There was little to no meaningless information anywhere in the lesson as every issue had a clear solution.The creator designed the lesson for teachers to collaborate with other teachers in their department of Math. There was a clear problem of files viable for students lost or in more places than one. The teachers were looking for a way to be able to reach documents and collaborate documents with each other. The solution, using Drop Box, was clearly communicated and applied.I admire that the creator used individualized one-on-one time to introduce the new learners, then allowed time for practice, and lastly had a questionnaire for all users that were still having any difficulty. He also set time to fix those problems and set goals for the group. Videos and Camtasia videos were also introduced for users.Overall the lesson allowed for excellence in teacher collaboration which in turn allows for greater understanding and learning for their students.Technical Remarks:Original link to the file is broken.",5
4110,"I think this lesson plan does a fine job of outlining a way in which to teach ACT preparation through the use of technology.  I especially liked the beginning piece of the activity where students will be graphing and examining data about the use of cell phones in schools.  I think that will really get their attention and help them to focus on the material presented throughout the lab.  I also really like the idea of integrating Google Docs into the lab section as I believe it leads to a great deal of collaboration and cooperation within the groups.  Finally, I think the technology expectations are well within the ability of students today and that it could be done quite well in a classroom.My only questions arose when I wanted to actually know what the lab you are doing is.  Perhaps as a chemistry teacher that matters more to me then it would others.  In truth though I am just curious what lab you are actually doing with this material?  I ask because as all science teachers know some labs go far easier with things like this then others do.  Also, as a suggestion for making the lesson seem more impactful perhaps including actual content or ACT standards would be a good idea for the instructional objectives.  I believe from looking at it that you synthesized those objectives yourself which I think is always a good idea but perhaps including some Michigan HSCEs, ACT standards, or Common Core standards might be a good idea.Technical Remarks:In terms of technical aspects of the activity I find no problems.  The actual lesson plan document worked perfectly and I believe the lesson described is well within a high school student’s technical ability.",4
4110,"Thanks for this lesson idea.  I also teach sophomores and juniors and am always looking for more ways to prepare them for the MME as schools are so focused on the results.  I like that the students are making their own graphs and ask to come up with conclusions about the data.One suggestion I would make is to have groups do different sets of data and have each group come up with questions that relate to their graph.  One the students share their graphs and data, the other groups can answer the questions.  This way all groups are not only practice analzying data, but also answering quetisons on data they are just seeing,Technical Remarks:Reading through this lesson it looks like this would all flow very smoothly with the technology.  Another thing you could do in addition to this lesson is to then have students collect data using a temperature or pH probe and practice collecting data using another form of technology.",4

4119,"I used this website as a tool for a lesson that I taught for my General Methods of Teaching course.  This is a 300-level methodology course for elementary, middle and secondary education majors.  The remarks from the students included: 1) postive comments on the addition of the cultural (Native American) stories that I added to the lesson; 2) the interest the website generated and the ability to use the website to further their understanding of the lesson plan's stated objectives; 3) the website demonstrated how they could effectively use technology in their future lesson plans; and 4) students commented that the website was easy to use.The quality of the materials was educationally significant for the objectives for the lesson and would enhance the learning for students and my teaching.Because we did not have a GPS unit available, students expressed their interest in doing a similar lesson and including the GPS portion of the lesson rather than having the data given to them.Technical Remarks:The website was easy to access and easy to use.",4

4122,This was a great StAIR. I really liked the layout and it flowed nicely. It also did not attempt to cover too much at one time and provided examples. I would add an audio option for students who would have trouble reading some of the longer slides. ,4
4122,"As a stand alone project this is done well, however for use with 2nd grade students there may be a problem for students that have difficulty in reading. Adding an audio component would allow students not only to read but to listen to the content and answer questions without assistance.Technical Remarks:No technical problems everything worked.",3
4123,"This StAIR really did a great job of incorporating TPACK. First, it is connected to content standards for elementary science. Second, it allows students to explore the concept of water treatment virtually. Third, it uses sound pedagogy by not only teaching students the process of water treatment, but also by teaching them how to navigate the site itself.Quick Highlights:*Connects to content standards*Easy to navigate*Glossary provided*Audio provided to support struggling readers*Site navigation information provided*Images and video clips throughout to aid the visual learner and to make more interesting*Short learning check quizzes provided to show mastery of concepts*Culminates in a creation piece. Students have opportunity to create their own mini water filtration system. Another point to take into consideration is Universal Design. By providing directions for how to navigate the site and providing audio support, this lesson does lend itself to be accessible to a wide range of learners.Technical Remarks:Links and video clips work.Will need computer and internet access for this lesson. If you are using this in the classroom and not as a Flip teaching method, you may want to consider having head phones available for students to use.",5
4123,"This was an excellent presentation on water treatment. It addresses many types of learning styles incorporating audio, visuals and an activity at the end. The water treatment activity at the end was especially effective as it worked both as an assessment and an interactive tool for the learner that needs to do something, which is not always easily addressed. Near the middle of the presentation there is an interactive chart with was very engaging and interesting, and the video that showed the water treatment process helped to supplement the information already given in a clear and fun way. The introduction was particularly constructive as it provided an explanation for how to use the buttons in the presentation. However, there were a couple of areas that should be looked at for improvement. At one point it was possible to skip to the next slide without answering the questions. And at the activity at the end the slides skipped back to earlier slides then I was never able to get back to that place again. This was really well done, and I learned a lot.",5

4128,"Comment on Accessibility, Its a Right!
http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php

I liked this website very much and I liked the way they deal with the issue of accessibility. It uses very simple and very understandable language. They start with defining accessibility, which they mention means that people with different disabilities can understand, navigate, and interact with the web. This is so important, because the web touches many aspects of our lives such as education, health, employment and more. They also elaborate about how we can make the web accessible by using different types of software for different types of disabilities such vision, hearing and mobility. 

As a teacher or a designer, I always take into consideration students or learners with different types of disabilities and try to do my best to solve their problems, or at least not to let the disability hinder their learning. I think that it is something any teacher or designer should think about. In other words, teachers and designers should make it part of their planning and change their way of teaching to meet the needs of all the students. 

In my view this website is a must see for those involved in the fields of teaching and designing, because it is full of very useful information about how and why accessibility is important to designers.",4
4128,"This web provides simple and clear definition of accessibility, the reason why web accessibility is important, how to make the web accessible and introduces software. It helps developers and educators design websites that can be more accessible to those with impairments.",4
4128,"I was very impressed by the index page among other educational tools, which accurately started with the meaning of accessibility and its implications. That caught my attention right away, and essentially thats what browsing is all about the act of capturing the attention of the visitor. In the online community, it has been well known that if you can't satisfy the curiosity of the visitor in the first 30 seconds you might lose your hit. The article discusses in detail all accessibility issues, including disability, illiteracy, technology barriers, equal access/opportunity and interaction. In my opinion, this website represented all seven principles of Universal Instructional Design and effectively addressed their implication with supporting policies and resources. 

The article is an exceptional learning and teaching resource about accessibility, disabilities and digital divide. I will be visiting this website frequently to use the contained practical knowledge and implement it in my prototype. Excellent job Lu, tnx.Technical Remarks:easy to navigate, accessible, flexibility in participation, straightforward and provides supportive learning.",4
4128,"You posted an excellent website dealing with accessibility . Here is what I explored more about the website. 

W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was founded by Sir. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web. This consortium ensures compatibility and agreement among industries in the adoption of new standards.  

The Web is having great impact on the way we work, learn, live and communicate with one another. It is essential that this new medium be accessible to everyone including people with disabilities. Consortium helps to make the Web more accessible for people with disabilities. Consortium addresses accessibility on many levels.  

People with disabilities use a wide range of alternative approaches, different from traditional mouse-and-screen-based browsers. W3C provides the information on Screen-readers, Browsers with adaptive technology, Voice browsers and other access methods. (http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing) 

It is essential that educational institutions to think in advance, and develop best practice policies that will ensure the organizations resources are always accessible to everyone; equal access for all students. W3C.org is one reliable resource to do this. The Consortium is engaged in a project to help people to understand accessibility of web pages and to set up some standards on how to judge if pages are accessible and how to make sure the pages that are written are accessible. These guidelines and other information can be found at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/. Also the tutorials published on W3C, by the actual developers of the technologies, is very useful.",5

4130,"This site really kept me interested in learning about different types of weather. All of the activities have easy-to-read instructions, so the students can do them without a lot of assistance.Technical Remarks:A first time user would find this site easy to navigate, and is a fun way to learn about weather.",4
4131,"The title holds out hope that this might be the long-hoped-for ""Grout-killer"". Alas, this book is totally useless for any purpose that I can imagine.  Each period of Western music gets about a page, divided into subtopics, which each get 2 or 3 sentences. The subdivision is not even useful as a historical outline. Almost any open-access ""music appreciation"" text does a better job of telling the story of Western music history.",1
4132,"This is a good presentation that discusses and allows students to learn about and work on the Westward Expansion of the United States. It discusses the Louisiana Purchase, the issues with Mexico, the California Gold Rush, and the Oregon Trail.  Students are clearly introduced to what they are going to be learning about, and it even gives them the option of choosing which focus they want to begin with.  Many different types of pedagogies are in place, ranging from visual, to analyzing, to applying the material, to evaluating.  The only strategy that I felt that could be more utilized was the use of auditory skills.  ELL students, at-risk, or auditory impaired students may have a difficult time viewing this presentation.  However, the UDL principals are definitely in place, since many different representations are used to show the information, students can apply their findings, students are asked to be engaged, and they are also challenged to show their learning in various ways, such as journal entries, poems, songs, or plays.  Students are given options as to how they would like to share their learning and are not confined to one way.  The presentation also has various websites linked to it, which offer additional resources and ways for students to feel connected to the past!  One thing that I truly enjoyed about this presentation is the way that students will be assessed at the end to check their learning and findings.  Students are given an exit ticket (a survey) that allows the teacher to grade their work and what they learned.  This is a great presentation that allows students to be creative, uses various levels of Bloom's Taxonomy and interactive tools.Technical Remarks:This presentation offers embedded links to websites that offer visuals, pictures and a YouTube video.  This presentation if very easy to navigate, user friendly, informational and interactive.",5

4134,A great resource to introduce students to the world of science and all that it encompasses!,5
4134,Good introduction to the field of science. It also supplies some good teaching resources for teachers. Helpful.,3
4134,It is essential for our students to understand what science is. This website is a good resource for helping them establish that understanding. ,5
4135,"I thought the overall presentation was nice. The appearance was exciting for the age level of the students. I felt it did lack content instruction. It seemed to be more of a lesson instead of a tutorial to instruct them how to do an activity. The sound was captivating. The actual lesson was very good. You did follow some of the UDL principles which are great. There was clarity of the evaluation. It had a good navigation flow. There were no broken links. Based on the TPACK model, there was some background knowledge that the students had to use.Technical Remarks:The Slide show presentation showed well. The interactive clocks are a good way to captivate the audience. You used great sound and animation.",3
4135,"This presentation is a effective way to reinforce analog and digital time reading. The presentation is short, but contains a number of exercises that reinforce time concepts. This presentation is best used as a building block for continued learning, because the fundamentals of time keeping are not explained in detail.Technical Remarks:Everything works. The file submitted is the actual PowerPoint presentation which can be edited. This file may need to be saved as a show before handing it over to students. This will require appropriate software.",5
4136,"This is a very useful and interactive tool to use for introducing the concept of life coaching.

4137,"This was very easy to follow and understand. I especially enjoyed the idea of not only having the students write their own poem, but also asking them to record their voices as they read it!The only suggestion that I could think of is to provide them with an additional example. It's my belief that if they see an example of this assignment completed by a previous student, that would be helpful. Technical Remarks:I like how many different technology pieces the students are exposed to in this lesson. ",4
4137,"I think your lesson plan is well written and easy to understand. The idea of making a poetry for their own is great for their creativity. Technology tools integrated to this lesson also look proper to accomplish this project. To break down the lesson into 5 days looks very helpful for students to take time when there are creative activities expected. Technical Remarks:I just recommend the other blog tools for the kids. Blogger is one of Google app, so there is an age restriction. It would be convenient for them to use weebly.com which provide student's blog for free.",4
4138,This is a good reason for teachers to teach science.,4
4139,"The resource itself comprises an animated video showing 90 fairly well-known painted portraits of women. The paintings span from the mid-12th century to the mid 20th century (a rather longer period than the '500 years' mentioned in the video title) and are largely drawn from the Western canon.The video was nominated as Most Creative Video in the 2nd Annual YouTube Awards. The animation morphs one painting into the next, which has the effect of emphasising areas of similarly and difference between them. The video is just under three minutes in length and can be paused at any point to allow closer examination of a particular painting.On its own, the resource provides a visual overview of the changing styles of portraiture since the mid-12th cenutry and could be used by teachers at all educational levels. The resource offers considerable potential for use in the classroom, for example as a prompt for discussing developments in the representation of idealised beauty, the use of brushwork, colour, tone and other aspects of form, together with developments in the representation of three-dimensional forms through modelling. Educators using the video may also wish to point out the bounded selection, perhaps encouraging comparisons with non-Western art.The teaching and learning potential of the resource is greatly enhanced by provision of a list of the 90 featured paintings, accessed by clicking the 'Show More' button under the video display area. The list gives a small image showing a selected area of each work (the portrait featured in the video), accompanied by the artist's name, the work title and date. Further information about each artist can be gained by clicking on their name (offering a link to an external source). There is also a link to an additional list featuring large, high quality images of each work in full. These additional resources offer the potential for both in-class use and self-study by independent learners. The resource could also be used by educators in the context of online teaching and learning.The supplementary list of full-size works offers acessibility advantages in that learners with visual impairment have the opportunity to magnify the images provided.I have used the resource in an online tutorial with Level 1 UK university students, focusing on the ways in which deviation from mimesis might be achieved through colour, tone, composition etc. The video resource was very well received and I was able to use the additional web page resources to set students homework, tasking them with researching the link between form and context.Technical Remarks:Using Google Chrome and a relatively fast broadband connection the video was a little slow to load initially but the quality was high.",4
4139,"This was a beautiful video.  Could be a great way to kickstart a discussion on the way women are depicted in the arts.  Does a nice job of giving a ""visual overview"" of centuries of painting.",4
4140,"I wish the site had more search options, more transparent organization (units? subjects? related materials? ), and grade level recommendations for the materials presented.",3
4140,"This website is great to use with children for it has many interactive components that will help students understand science. The children can play games and do interactive activities. I really like the interactive activities for if you get something incorrect they give you ""hints"" as to what you did incorrectly and then give you the option to try again. Not to mention the printable activities can be used as homework, or for students who get done early, which is great so that you do not have to make some up on your own.Technical Remarks:Navigating the website is a little tricky, for when you first get to the website I was unsure where to click and through trial and error I found in order to get to the main links that you have to click on the icon in the upper left hand corner.",4
4140,this is a site that will give students a deep idea and intrest over many topics.It's graphics are high quality one..,5
4141,This website has an extensive list of newspapers for every country in the world.Technical Remarks:It's easy to navigate. You can look up a country by region or alphabetically.,5
4142,"When looking for online material for World Regional Geography, there are few collected resources.  Part of the problem in this respect may be due to some inherent structural issues in the courses themselves.  WRG courses attempt to provide a narrative of the entire world broken into 10-15 logical regions.  This is a tremendous undertaking and few individuals or organizations would commit to such an undertaking, then release the work under a creative commons license.  In this case, the textbook is highly usable, but it can be idiosyncratic.  It presents as a very long pdf document, but as such it can be loaded into most e-text readers and searched.  Most of the criticism that could be levelled at it (overly broad, little depth) is applicable to any book produced for World Regional Geography.  It is a completely adequate resource for the subject, bearing in mind that an instructor would likely want to provide supplementary material.",4
4143,"This seems like a potential resource especially valuable for online and hybrid courses. Provides ""lecture"" material or alternative or supplement to a traditional textbook. In addition to the videos, click ""Lauch a Course"" at the top to access discussion questions and other resource for each ""chapter"". Also provides ""Textbook correlations"" to help match up the videos with content from other popular world's religions textbooks.",4
4144,"I found this lesson to be informative and well designed. The PowerPoint presentation’s esthetics are pleasing. The template used is not distracting from the presentation. The font is large enough for users to read without difficulty, as well as, the font format not being hard to decipher. There is also a natural flow to the presentation that is addressed at the beginning. The content of the presentation is clearly defined at the beginning of the stand alone through its objectives. The vocabulary is well defined through readings and videos. The two views discussed are represented equally and without biasness. I even like how the presentation discusses how both views criticizes the other. The two videos for this section do a great job relaying this aspect of the debate. From a pedagogical aspect, the learner’s attention is kept throughout the stand alone by the engaging videos and quizzes. I think today’s students need media rich learning material to keep them engaged. This also supports all learners because it provides a review of the materials through text and the videos. The assessments allow the students to assess the information they are retaining throughout the presentation. The students also use their higher level thinking skills to answer the questions during the assessment portions of the presentation.Technical Remarks:I would only suggest that the presentation allow the teacher to have the option to split the presentation into two parts. There is a clear place where this could be done.",5
4144,"This is a wonderful lesson! From a technological perspective this lesson utilizes PowerPoint that enhances the learning for students. It also provides instructional videos to cater toward learners who struggle with reading comprehension or fluency. I like how the videos are placed throughout the lesson. I think because of our 21st century learners today, multimedia is what draws the attention of students. Both of these technology enhancements provide students with added motivation for learning. From a pedagogical and content perspective, this lesson does a good job of walking students step- by- step though understanding the concepts taught. There is text, backed up by videos to accommodate all learning types. I also like how this lesson ties into a learner’s life. I think for this lesson to be believable, the learners have to be able to understand how what they learned will make sense in their own lives. I think by providing meaningful experiences through the use of examples in this lesson provide more motivation for learning. This lesson has clearly stated objectives, goals, assessments and feedback. I like how students are given clear feedback upon how to correct incorrect responses. This helps students who need more scaffolding throughout instruction to guide their learning. I do not know too much about worldviews of religion, but I could understand many parts of this lesson by watching the videos. Also, the use of colors really enhances the lesson and attracts learners to it. I also feel that this provides motivation for learning. Through the use of multiple assessments, the teacher is really able to know if the students are grasping the concepts and students are able to assess their understanding of the learning objectives. Additionally, there are clear instructions that guide students to completing this lesson independently. Finally, there are many different tasks asked for students to do in this lesson that provides for higher level thinking and really gives the students a challenge by setting high expectations for learning. I would definitely use this presentation if I were teaching these concepts in my classroom. I especially like it because this can be given to students as a homework assignment or to students who are absent on the day given because it is something that students can use independently.Technical Remarks:The only change I would make in this lesson is to split up the content into different parts. Especially for special education students or low achieving students, this may be too much information to throw at students in one sitting.",5
4145,"I reviewed the materials by spending about 40 minutes looking at many of the pages, reading the information, comparing it to paper writing texts and handbooks, and exploring the ease of navigation.  The materials are accurate and thorough, but I see little or no difference from a paper copy of the same information.  First-time users will have no problem navigating the site, but may be disappointed that it is so text heavy.Technical Remarks: The menus are easy to follow, and it is easy to navigate back to the start or switch to another topic.",3
4146,"As a clearinghouse, this site is a portal to diverse resources, including journals, conferences, directories, and bibliographies as well as full texts of articles and books. First time visitors might want to start with the ""Introduction to Writing Across the Curriculum"" available at http://wac.colostate.edu/intro/Technical Remarks:This site contains high quality content, but it can be difficult for newcomers to navigate.",5
4147,"Excellent and simple presentation, it gives an important notion of what is an argument differentiating  logics and rhetoric, explains wonderfully the parts that the essay should have and it is a great guidance when it comes to advice on the steps to follow before and after finishing the first draft.",5

4154,"Overall a good list of project management links.  Some more useful than others, but worth taking a look at.Technical Remarks: Bad site design, needs updating.",4
4154,Great link-site for project management.  Some links definitely better than others.  Of particular interest was the Software Engineering Hotlist from Georgia Tech.,4
4154,After reviewing for only 15-20 mins I was able to find detailed information about project managment.  There are tons of links that relate to other sites offering additional detailed information.,4
4155,"This material is designed for graduate level courses (as the name suggests) in Geotechnical Engineering. It is designed for MIT open courseware. The material contains syllabus, assignments and exams without solutions which is good but the major drawback of this material is that it does not have any other ‘actual’ course material as such. The syllabus and assignments etc are useful for instructors to design a course and it is not meant for students! ",3
4156,This is a complete course share of a Groundwater Hydrology course at MIT.  The material is advanced - a 400/500 level university course.  Some of the assignment materials are dated and a bit abstract but are similar to the content that I was exposed to in a graduate level hydrogeology course.  The material in the lectures notes seemed particularly useful to me.  The textbooks listed in the readings section are the classic textbooks for the material presented in the lecture notes.  Some overlap in content covered.  An individual student would probably not be able to justify purchasing them all for a single course but a professional hydrogeologist would hope to have many of these on their bookshelf!,4
4157,This would be a fun warm up exercise but it doesn’t really teach any content or explore it further. It is not a teaching aid per se but it could engage students and make them interested in understanding  “how it works” thus generating dialogue and learning opportunities. Simple to use.,2
4158,"Wow!!  This is an open online course teaching English pronunciation to higher level students, although it appears to be taught f2f, but may be a hybrid/hyflex.  The layout of the course is easy to follow.  All the material used is very relevant and available for purchase.  Handouts from the class being taught are available in .pdf format, are easy to understand and ready to be used.  There are four (4) taped video presentations of the class to see how it was taught.  Great syllabus and detailed calendar, with due dates and schedule.  Learning objectives are clear, and grading scale is simple.  I will definitely be using this course.  It's a bit dated (2004) but still very relevant.",5
4159,"i think this learning material is awesome, i'm going to use it in my classes.I'll take very time in studying these materials.Very complete and understandable. congratulations",4
4160,"I was impressed with the thoroughness and relevance of this course material, which seems carefully designed to anticipate student questions and provide scaffolding for their learning process. Autobiographical readings are clearly connected to homework exercises. For instance, prompts that accompany readings help students think deeply about not only how and why those readings are constructed but also ways in which these elements could relate to their (students') own autobiographical writing choices. (And the information/links on how to get published encourage an even deeper level of student investment.) I can see myself adapting assignments and prompts for working with both undergraduate and graduate students.
The one area of concern I have (and it's a challenge I still grapple with, too) is the extremely ""text-dense"" design of the course materials--huge chunks of text loaded with information to the point of potentially overwhelming the readers. Things to think about: redesigning assignments for online-learning/multi-modality contexts; separating lengthier assignment handouts into step-by-step (e.g., here's what to do / how to do it) vs. relevant but non-sequential information (e.g., here are some narrative writing strategies) focuses; playing with visual/organizational redesign (e.g., color and placement choices); and simplifying the homework submission process to electronic only (while being quietly flexible about accepting hard copies in an emergency).
There is a ton of rich content overall, which I plan to return to and explore more deeply.
Thanks for sharing it!",4
4161,Should propose exercises.,4
4162,Great way to hear Shakespeare's words.,5
4163,A great project to give to the students and will help those hands-on learners.,4
4164,Great lesson to teach basic PowerPoint skills.  The great thing is that it could be tweaked to fit different topics across the curriculum.  This lesson would work best with smaller classes since the teacher intends to individually guide each student.  Larger classes may need to pair up and work together to help lighten the load for the teacher.Technical Remarks:No technical problems,4
4164,This is a great lesson for a beginner with technology.  The lesson was hands on and you offered great assistance to your students.  Perhaps you might consider buddying up students who are stronger in their technological skills with those who are just beginning their learning process.Technical Remarks:No technical problems,4
4165,"This is a great astronomy web site for kids to navigate through.  The solar system home page features a moving diagram with the planets all revolving around the sun.  It is a great tool to give kids a general idea of how the planets are laid out and how they revolve around the sun.  Each planet has a link that pops up as you scroll over it that takes you to a specific page on that planet.  Each page has a great photo that seems like a live feed because it is a moving photo.  There is a lot of information provided on each planet and it is all written in a tone that is comprehensible for students.  There are also the same links available on that page for all the planets' moons and for asteroids and comets as well.  Students can also learn about deep space and access links to information on black holes, stars, and nebulas to name a few.  There is a link to space exploration that gives students an opportunity to see what we are developing for future space exploration.  On this page there is a very fascinating link on Mars exploration and what the future holds for visiting Mars.  There are a lot of great and creative lessons that could be designed from the information on that page.  Additionally, there is a page to learn about the constellations and to actually detect them on the page.  This page also features the phases of the moon.  The website offers a free online class as well with numerous assignments.  All in all, this is a great tool to use for teaching astronomy in the classroom.Technical Remarks:This website is very easy to navigate and use.  There are many links, all of which are clearly identified and working properly.  The motion of the planet photos is a great addition to the website.",4
4165,"This site has lots of good basic information about the solar system, particularly the planets and their moons.  It is great for kids and educators.  It makes learning interesting and fun for students. It provides free online lessons, which consists of packets with assignments that are designed for ages 7-11 and 12-18.  This is a wonderful resource. It is also nice that it is updated and states that Pluto is no longer considered the 9th planet, but is referred to as a dwarf planet.Technical Remarks:This website is user friendly and provides easy access for students and teachers.",5
4166,Good for photography students and photographers to make connections.Technical Remarks:Must create an account. May login through Facebook.,4
4167,Repition of standard textbook material.  No actual content.  Better suited for highschool audience.,2
4167,Has a good layout.  It should be easy for the beginner to understand the article.,4
4168,"Excellent resource. Put the ""picture of the day"" up on your Smartboard before the beginning of each class. It should provide an added value and raise levels of curiosity about science and eventually math.",5
4169,Having trouble with the metric system? This is a pretty good reference for those people who always have trouble converting the metric system. This might be helpful to people who are interested in drafting. I remember I always have a hard time converting inches into centimeters when labeling my drawings.,3
4170,I think I will use this resource to teach in my CTAP class. I like the idea of a clearinghouse of websites that deal with the argument about the lunar mission.,5
4171,"I thought the content intelligent and helpful. I spent 30 minutes reading, I will be utilizing it for upcoming presentions. My kids also have need of this information. I thought the concept to be easy to understand and something people will use. I think this can help improve a students confidence and performace.This also improves your conversational skills by being direct,confident. The material was very easy to use.",4
4172,1. Time Spent: 10 minutes of overview2. Content Quality:  Excellent material.  Very in-depth study of international standards for software engineering.  This is a draft collection for a software engineering bank of knowledge.3.  Teaching Effectiveness:  This is a useful supplement for introductory computer science classes.4. Ease of use:  A novice should have no difficulty maneuvering through this site.,4
4173,This is a lesson that will engage students! I can see it being used at all grade levels.,5
4174,"Great Job, Terri!",5
4175,"Quality of Content: This material presents valid concepts, models, and skills. It is set up in a discussion format, in which common difficulties are expressed and teachers work together to find a solution. This software presents multiple educational concepts, models, and skills related to first grade addition and subtraction.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching-Learning Tool: This particular resource was originally created for the explanation stage of the learning process. This is directed towards the educator, as questions centered on mathematical concepts are presented. The majority of the material, however, is in the practice stage of the learning process. Many materials are introduced so that students may practice the addition and subtraction facts presented, and give students the opportunity to approach and internalize the concepts in a relatable manner. This material also contains short lessons which push student thinking and would be categorized as the applying stage. This is a great resource because it can be used for learners in every stage of the learning process.  After successfully learning with the material presented, students will correctly add and subtract numbers through 30. The target learner is one who has difficulty memorizing addition and subtraction facts, and requires a hands-on and more authentic learning approach. This learner must use manipulatives, be given the opportunity to work with others when necessary, and is searching for a personal connection to the concept. The material presented improves both the educator and student’s ability to teach and learn the material. Since there are so many available resources, students and teachers will benefit from the variety of lessons. Resources are listed based on the needs of the teachers and students. The software can also be readily integrated into the current curriculum. Addition and subtraction skills are crucial in first grade and directly tied to future mathematical success. As a first grade teacher, I have found that these resources will seamlessly be tied into my teaching to promote authentic mathematical thinking.  Many different learning needs are addressed, and a lesson plan or teaching technique is suggested for each. The teaching and learning goals are easy to identify, and are also easy to search through with the questions listed at the top of the piece. Lastly, good learning assignments can be written easily, as there are many math resources that can be adapted for lesson plans. Many of the resources also include ways to teach the concepts, making it extremely easy for the teacher to envision the use of the material in his/her own classroom.Ease of Use: The labels, buttons, menus, text, and general layout are user-friendly and easy to navigate. The question links at the top of the page help direct the reader to the information needed. Although the reader does not become trapped in the material or feel overwhelmed, it is possible to become lost in the material. It is somewhat difficult to determine what is written among the commenting and resources, however, once it is deciphered there is an abundance of wonderful information. The module does provide feedback in that it is set up in a question and answer type format. That is, teachers post difficulties and a lesson or technique is provided. It is also flexible in that it can be used for many different learning styles, and provides both drill and practice format lessons, along with extension information to make the learning more meaningful. The learning material does not require much documentation, technical support, or instruction. The software simply presents materials that the teacher can provide to enhance mathematical thinking. The material is familiar to students in that it is all centered on addition and subtraction, but it is also attractive for students because of the wide-variety of resources.",4
4176,Feedback for STAIR Heather Bradlee-Amazing Adverbs Quality of Content The lesson presented in this STAIR had very accurate and clear information. It was easy to see what the main goal of the STAIR was- Adverbs. The examples provided supported the lesson well. The feedback was clear and direct to the question that was given. This STAIR would definitely help support middle school Language Arts. Potential Effectiveness as a Teacher-Learning Tool Based on what I could see from doing the STAIR myself this would be a very effective tool for a teacher. In presenting the questions to the students you started with the easier questions and gradually worked up to the harder ones. The explanations to the answers were clear and accurate. It was just long enough to keep the students involved and get an accurate idea of where they may need further teaching. Ease of Use This STAIR was very easy to use. The buttons were easily accessible and it was clear what the user needed to do. All of the links worked and directed you to the correct slides. Nice Job!,5
4176,"The lesson provides helpful instruction on identifying adverbs.This StAIR was very visually appealing. The feedback provided was very encouraging and very valuable. Correct and incorrect feedback encouraged the user to move on.The star buttons are cute, but I found myself wanting to click on the answer vs. the button; maybe additional transparent buttons over the answers.There is a lot of text. There is good information but for non-readers or visual learners, it is a lot of information. Even breaking it up w/ animations would be helpful to the users.",4
4176,"This can be used on the SMART Board, or in a computer lab.",5
4177,Relates to kids and gives good ideas as to ways of approaching topics in order to peak student interest and excitement,4
4178,"I spent about 10 minutes browsing this site.  I didn't think that it was particularly accessible for first time users.  The homepage just presented a list of all the links.  There was no general description.  The link to get more information about the purpose of the site did not work the first time I clicked on it, but I was able to access it later.  The site is mostly geared to a special program that it sponsors.  People outside of that program may find some of the information useful.  People who enroll in the program will probably reap great benefits from this website. Technical Remarks: I clicked on links at least three times and got the ""page not found"" error.  I clicked on all of them at a later time, and the appropriate pages were displayed.  The home page is not terribly user friendly, unless you know exactly what you want.  It mostly contains links in tables.  There is mostly text and only a few graphics on the home page.",3
4178,"This site is for those in the meteorology curriculum or for those interested in meteorology. The site is setup so that its possible to see what the weather will be like in the next few days for those that record. The site has weather summaries for each day of the upcoming week. It explains where cold fronts, warm fronts, high pressure areas, low pressure areas and so on, would be located with respect to the United States. The site also has a historical section for everyday, this shows what major weather related event happened on that day. The other important aspect of the site is the interactive part, which quizzes the visitor on weather maps. The quiz usually has a weather map and questions about it, this helps the visitor or student practice reading weather maps.	I have used this site a couple times before when I was in meteorology; I found it very informative and helpful when it came to this subject. The American Meteorological Association is a credible and well-respected organization so the validity of the site is not in question. The models are accurate and up to date, the skills or procedures taught are related to those used by professionals. The site is very educational and effective when it comes to meteorology. Since these types of sites are rare it is a good addition to the merlot archives. This site receives a five star rating for these reasons.Technical Remarks: This site was easy to use and easy to use what materials it gave you. The site was free of any problems or glitches that are sometimes present in other sites. The only assistance that is needed when using this site is that of a meteorological professor. The reason is because many technical terms are used in this site and if the person has little knowledge of the subject it can be confusing. No additional software or hardware is needed to use this site,
 the site works just as good on one computer as the other. ",5
4179,Provides students an interesting way to learn required materials while relating math principles to everyday life. Uses Moodle as a collaboration tool in completing interactive weekly assignments. Materials can be adapted for different types of learners. Also uses novelty items (YouTube) to engage learners.,5
4180,"Information is well organized and clearly written. This presentation allows students to learn at their own pace. As students click through the pages they are asked questions to reinforce information being covered. They are instantly told if the are correct. In addition to text, there are many diagrams and examples. A lot of information is being presented at one time, so this application would work better as a review rather than an introduction.",5
4180,Great algebra lesson!  The examples are very helpful and the explanations.  I really love the use of polls!Technical Remarks:Everything seemed to work properly and was easy to follow,5
4180,"This is an excellent lesson. Her instructions are very easy to follow and if you are from MI, she has listed the Mi content standards.",5
4181,"This website offers children songs in the Arabic language. The interesting aspect about it is that the songs are transliterated, translated and written in Arabic alphabet. A significant resource to the learner of Arabic for the valuable content of all there basic skills to acquire a new language and practice and learn new vocabulary simple enough for a native child yet essential for the adult foreign learner.Technical Remarks:requires MP3 or MWP software.",5
4182,"The YouTube video is excellent! Very well done. The video allows students to make many connections so that the Aral Sea isn’t such a strange thing. The video contains great images that go well with the voice over.  The accompanying PowerPoint has a lot of great information, however, I could not get it to function correctly. When I clicked on the voice over button, nothing happened.  I was also unable to click on the answers to the questions.The voice over component (when it works) is great for students! This will really help all learners! The slide organization is also well done and clear. The pros and cons are clear to understand which will help students work through the lesson.  Once again, the video is excellent! A transcript may be helpful to involve all learners.Technical Remarks:Had problems getting the presentation to work correctly. The voice over would not play and the questions would not work.",4
4183,"This project is designed for adult learners so it was less   “razzle dazzle” and more informative. Utilized two principles of the NETS for Administrators  which was similar to lesson plan: Excellence in Professional Practice, and Systemic Improvement,  The quizzes were great and I enjoyed the extra tool added for the date calendar.Technical Remarks:I would have liked to have seen a better ending for this project. Specifically, a home button after the last slide",3
4183,"Very nice and informative! I really liked the actual copies of pages you were talking about. That helps the user not only find the paper by the number, but by how it looks. I also liked that you had arrows and descriptions next to areas on the forms you were talking about. I liked that the user can go back to the information to re-read before answering the question again. Great job with organized information and use of text-to-speech availability on slides. The only problem I had was that on a few slides, I realized there was no back button and I couldn’t go back to read something again or if I missed information. On the slide with the “steps to apply,” you might want to make sure the user knows to click on each step. I didn’t know that and just clicked in the area and got stuck in the middle of the information. Also your “important rules” slide doesn’t have a next button to get to your last slide which has great helpful information. An idea for improvement would be for your date calculator slide, I would hyperlink the web address to make it easier to access. I think you did a good job meeting instructional design, instructional strategy of deductive reasoning, and UDL principles. Overall it’s great and very informative! I enjoyed learning about OPT!",4
4184,"This app is specifically for the iPhone. Because of the size, it is really difficult to clearly view some of the images. The zoom feature is not particularly strong.",3
4185,Great activity for students learning about atoms.  Students should be sure to read the atom builder guide before begining.,5
4186,"This is an AWESOME foreign language lesson. It goes well beyond just learning the language. The idea behind creating the menu and performing the skit really allows students to see the importance in what they're learning, put what they've learned into action, and have fun doing it. I agree that if something like this were incorporated into any of the foreign language classes I have previously taken I would have enjoyed them much more. It's so important with learning a language to put your new skills to practical use. The technology pieces that are incorporated into this lesson are great too. You could've just stopped at the students performing the skit like most teachers do, instead the skit will be recorded, edited by students, and posted to YouTube! How exciting for them to share their work with the world.Technical Remarks:None",5
4186,"I can see your students really enjoying this lesson!  I especially enjoyed seeing the combination of real-world applications and creativity.  Both of those aspects will make this assignment more meaningful to students.  If my foreign language classes were like this, I might have continued taking them rather than stopping as soon as I had completed my school's requirements!  (Endless conjugations and verb forms didn't make for a very exciting class.)",5
4187,"This presentation was great it provides a step by step explanation of Basic Ohms Law. The target audience is for High School. The information seems appropriate for the age group, and is highlighted with key words. The appearance was good. You had a nice navigation flow. There were no broken links. The introduction prepared the students for what they were about to learn. There was some scaffolding utilized throughout the project. You followed the goal oriented design principles that focus on students understanding. There was a good quality of resources. The content seems useful for the students and it did not lack meaningful assessment.Technical Remarks:The presentation showed well. You used nice sound and animations. Your hyperlinks was used effectively.",5
4187,"The technological aspects of the presentation seemed to work perfectly. The fact that help was included on each page that was incorrect will be useful to the students. I feel that although this is geared toward adults it could include some graphics, sound and/or video to make it a little more interesting. This would be also be beneficial to those that are visual learners. I know that at the college level there are many foreign students. Can this be set up where there is a tab for translation? The beginning includes a review of what they should already know which instructionally will help the students who could not remember the equations. The end slide should show that they have completed the task rather than linking back to the beginning to start again. The site took me around 10-12 minutes to view. I was just guessing at all of the responses but if a student was actually doing this activity and having to figure our equations I would imagine it would take a little longer.",4
4187,This presentation is designed as an additional learning tool for students that may be having difficulties learning Ohm's law.,5
4188,"I think this a great resource to use in a second grade classroom.  It  is simple and fun for the students, plus integrates the use of technology.  Technical Remarks:It seems when I click on the answer it puts me to a screen that tells me I'm not allowed.  Maybe check the settings on google to see if it is open to all on the WEB.  ",4
4189,Very accessible tutorial.  Professional skill appears throughout.,5
4189,"Initially, I had only heard vaguely about BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensation), but after about a half hour at this website, I at least understand the basic ideas behind the strange physics of BEC.  This website uses a format of questions and answers with a cartoon student and instructor.  I found it particularly refreshing that student was not afraid to put the brakes on the professor when the material began to move into slightly more advanced concepts.  There is also a series of interactive physics analogies (such as atoms in a mixing bowl having certain energy states or the evaporative cooling magnetic bowl).  These interactive tools proved helpful and at first a little challenging, although the general introductory level of the site does leave me wondering how relevant some of the interactive cartoons really are.  All in all, from a BEC beginner myself, I highly recommend this sight if you are even slightly interested in Bose-Einstein Condensation.Technical Remarks: The only technical remarks that I have to make concern a few dead-end URL links, specifically, they are the ones to Satyendra Nath Bose, a link to the 1997 Nobel Prize, and an off-site button that doesn't go anywhere.The physics behind BEC is beyond my current level of understanding, and all of the explanatory links where very helpful.  While I found this sight clearly presented and extremely informative, it is useful at only the most introductory of levels.",5
4190,"Although there is much discussion of optics, this isn't really much physics demonstrated with this applet.  Fun to tool around with, although a larger screen and better graphics would have helped.  Those familar with Virtual Pool will notice the similarity in the controls.",3

4194,"Even though I will not be able to use this lesson in my classroom due to my subject area, I found this lesson very intriguing.  I like how students are able to pick and choose a topic and a way to express their learning (UDL).  I also liked how the topics would appeal to most students – there are topics more for females (females in history) and typical males of that age (weapons).  Not being a history person, even I wanted to read all of the text that was available!Technical Remarks:All links seemed to work at the time I checked this resource.  My only concern with this lesson is the fact that many districts may not allow Google accounts for their students.  This may make the collaboration part a little more difficult to do – but not impossible.",5
4194,Engaging lesson plan!  The supporting Wiki and links provides a collaborative forum for students to select a subtopic of interest and review a wealth of information.Student's shared document(s) provides review by both peers and instructor feedback.  Well designed and I enjoyed the content and delivery method(s).Technical Remarks:Excellent links; no navigational issues.,5
4194,"I really enjoyed this lesson.  I am not a teacher of Social Studies, so I will not be able to use this lesson in my classroom, but I think it is a great lesson which utilizes UDL principles.  Because students get to choose how they want to show knowledge (writing, drawing, poetry) it draws upon many learning styles. I also think it is a great use of the Wiki Technology.  Students will be more engaged because if the interactive qualities of the Wiki.  While I personally cannot use the lesson as is because of the content that I teach, I plan to use it as a guide to format other lessons I can teach.Technical Remarks:Links work well and the Wiki link is a great resource.",5
4195,"This StAIR design is well thought-out and very manageable. The quality of content presents educationally significant concepts and skills in the discipline of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and more than that, this resource has been clearly aligned with curriculum standards. It is very smartly divided into the three categories of vocabulary, spelling, and pronunciation; however, students “figuring out spelling rules on their own” can look very different and support different methods and pedagogy. Because this is a design plan and not an actual StAIR, to use this resource instructors may design very different-looking solutions to address representation, action and expression, and engagement (UDL). I suggest modifying the design plan for this StAIR to provide a little more guidance for instructors as they design this resource for their students.  Having said that, this has the potential to be a very effective teaching tool, and this design plan it itself will lend itself to instructors as a useful resource. Because I am not an expert in TESOL I will not determine whether it is effective or not in the classroom; however, it is easy to follow along and understand the flow of this lesson, and coming from an instructor who is also a foreign language student, I think this design will be effective as a Stand-alone Instructional Resource.Technical Remarks:This design plan is easy to use as a single document and all of the technical aspects of the document function correctly. No links are broken, and the formatting should be compatible with most browsers and operating systems. Well done.",4

4212,"I really enjoyed exploring your StAIR. I must begin by saying that it is so CUTE! Children will love it. I adored the graphics you chose. I also felt that it was very easy to navigate through. I liked the choices in the begining. And I absolutly loved the game. I can see children having a good time with that. Your StAIR makes Circle stories very easy to understand for children. Each slide offered a new and pleasent surprise; wheather it be the nice graphics or activity, students will respond well to it. If I could change anything, I woudl problabley add audio or video. Great job overall. Technical Remarks:No technical problems.",5

I like the layout and creativity in it.  It is simple enough for young ages but I found myself captivated in the lesson. Technical Remarks:Some of the images covered text.  Also, some of the text was broken into to lines mid word.  The biggest improvement I would like to see it audio.  Usually with presentations I like to click through them myself unless there is audio guiding me.  A simple recording with this would knock it out of the park.",4
4212,"I really enjoyed the graphics that you chose (sticking with the circle theme is a nice touch) and I think children would respond positively to them as well. The directions are also clear and easy to follow. It only took me about 10 minutes to walk through the slideshow, but it would take children longer to read through and process the information and directions. I like the slide where the students create their own circle story and would love to see a graphic or example of one of these embedded into the powerpoint. Very cute lesson!Technical Remarks:The link mousecookiebooks.com did not work on the resources page or on the activity/games page. All of the other links are in working order.",5
4213,Contains some great information for anyone planning a climbing trip with youth. Has mini quizes embedded throughout the course.,5
4214,"This is a fantastic lesson incorporating many instructional strategies and different activites.  I love the fact that this includes so many different instructional strategies so it will appeal to many learners.  I like that there is the making of the physical clar model as well as the digital tour on Google Earth.  When they do the digital tour on Google Earth will they include the historial facts in their tour?  The lesson is scaffold very well with learning the basic vocabulary, then the clay model and then on to the digitial tour.  This is a great lesson.  Technical Remarks:PDF file - works great",5
4214,"A well thought out ID Lesson plan.  It seems engaging and utilizes many different formats of expressing what the students have learned.  I am uncertain how the project will connect the geographical aspect with the historical aspect. Also, perhaps investigation of a more engaging approach to the vocabulary might be used.  For example, use of a graphic organizer might make it more effective than a simple vocabulary matching worksheet.Technical Remarks:PDF Format.  Worked perfectly.",4
4215,Visually this StAIR project looks really good. I like how you have an explanation of the different symbols in the very beginning instead of assuming that the students will know how to use the StAIR. The animations and slide transitions are very interesting and engaging. However the slides that are a timed switch confused me at first because I wasn’t sure where to click. After that I realized it was a timed slide it was easy from there on out but it could be confusing to students. The visuals are very clear and go a long way to helping the student understand the concepts. It is a very clear way to illustrate the concepts without needed to necessarily understand the text. Great work.,4
4215,"The learning goals are clearly established for the user.  Navigation can be difficult.  Some of the slides move forward on their own, which can be an advantage of disadvantage for different students.  Other slides, require the student to purposely click to navigate forward, which I think might be easier for most students.  In addition, the home button takes the user back to the first slide, rather than to a table of contents where the user can navigate to another section.   The audio narration is spoken clearly and slowly.  This is helpful, especially since this is designed for ESL students.     This is a difficult learning goal to assess, but the assessment quizzes are thoughtfully created to make the user think about what they have just learned.  Wrong answers, however, do not give the students any feedback.   Finally, the two sections of the StAIR allow for differentiation so that some students can complete the entire activity, while others can just complete the first part of the activity.Technical Remarks:This StAIR is created with PowerPoint and uses text, images, animations, and audio.  Using a Mac with OS 10.5.8, all features worked, but I was not able to move on past Quiz 2.  It seems there is a broken link.",4
4215,"Great Work overall!I like how you had a page explaining the buttons and what their actions were.I noticed that some slides were timed to switch to the next slide and others you had to click the arrow. I think this might confuse kids if they are looking for a next button.I enjoy the animation of pictures, slide transitions, and words.    Your project is so colorful and exciting. I think this is a very engaging activity and grabs attention quickly and effectively.Also, some of the quiz selections took you to another slide and others simply made a noise. I like the spontaneity of your choices but I think that might confuse younger children.",5
4216,This course does not follow a design to teach consistent stroke use.  There are much better ones available that teach the letters by stroke use and develop a better foundation for cursive.,1
4217,Great insights. It sounds like the author's current institution is quite lucky to have her. What a great breadth of experience across her career.,4
4218,"Comprehensiveness
This textbook is very comprehensive of US copyright law. However, it does not address international copyright law issues. One of the best things about this book is that it is very recent and, as such, it contains examples of very modern cases on things like the enforceability of creative commons licenses. One downside of the book is that it contains a no-derivatives license. This makes it less ""open"" than a traditional open access book.
Content Accuracy
The content is provided by two law professors who are experts in the field. It is high quality content. That said, it really is the type of book best aimed at law students because it uses the traditional ""case method"" of teaching, which is typical of law classes.
Relevance Longevity
The content is very up-to-date and includes both watershed cases as well as modern cases. It will, of course, need to be updated in the future.
Clarity
The text is clear and free from grammatical issues.",5
4219,This app is not very stable. It has a tendency to crash often and this has been a consistent characteristic over the last few years. The app runs your images through filters to give you modified images. There are several other good photography/paint filter apps available without the frustration of constantly crashing.,2
4220,"Great, interactive presentation that takes the user through the multiple steps of creating a bronze vessel. This process can be complicated to explain without visualization. Textbook descriptions alone are often insufficient for students without a background in art history or studio art.

4226,"This is a great StAIR.  Cyberbullying is a very big problem today and it is very important for students to understand what it is and how to prevent it.  This StAIR does a good job of explaining what it is and comparing it to regular bullying.  It has a lot of reading so it's probably geared toward middle school to high school students.  The examples and ideas presented really relate to students and the world today.  I think that students would be eager to learn about cyberbullying.  This StAIR periodically checks for understanding with multiple choice questions.  I like how it gives an explaination if you get an answer wrong.  There were some  really cute graphics.  If one thing could be added it would be a video.  When considering the pedagogy of the StAIR, students may benefit from watching a video example of cyberbullying.  If I could change one thing about this StAIR I would time the navigation arrows so that they don't appear on the screen for about 30 seconds after each page is turned.  This way the student is forced to do all the reading and cannot simply click  through the presentation without paying attention.Technical Remarks:The only reason I gave this lesson four stars instead of five was because of the technical errors.  There were quite a few links on the check for understanding questions that did not do what they were intended to do.  For example on one of them, when you click the correct answer a box pops up and says ""incorrect...""  On a couple of other questions when you click on the correct answer it says ""correct"" and then there's nowhere else to click to move on to the next page so the student is forced to exit out of the presentation, click back through all of the slides and then click the incorrect answer on those questions in order to be able to move onto the next slide.  There were also a few multiple choice questions that had a choice that you could not click on.  They weren't hyperlinked.  For the most part the presentation did what it was supposed to do but there were several small errors that made it more difficult to navigate through than it needed to be.",4
4226,"I thought this was an overall excellent StAIR on bullying and cyberbullying. The information was presented in a very easy to read and understandable manner. The organization of the text and the vocabulary was uniform throughout. There was a lot of great information in general about methods in avoiding bullying and cyberbullying that could really give victims of bullying options in dealing with their problems. Bullying is always a problem in schools no matter the age of the students, so giving out valuable information like in this powerpoint is extremely important. Cyberbullying is the newest and most dfficult form of bullying to stop, so bringing attention to it as an issue is extremely important and is well presented in this StAIR. Technically, the StAIR is quite well done. The questions and answers sections make sure that the student is paying attention consistently. I especially liked the way that the presentation would take you back to the page where the information was contained if you missed a question. I did notice that a few of the buttons didn't work in the question section. I knew the correct answer on one slide, but the button didn't work so I had no choice but to answer incorrectly to go onto the next slide. Also, I wasn't exactly sure what the sound buttons were for. I initially thought they were spoken words to the slides, but when I clicked on them nothing really happened. These are just nitpicks to an overall pretty good StAIR. I would definitely use this in an anti-bullying lecture.",4
4227,This is a great project!,5
4227,"What a relevant topic to cover with your StAIR. This is huge focus in schools today and this is a great tool for students to use. I enjoyed the audio introduction. You also provided users with great resources via the website and videos. I also liked the fact that on the quiz questions, if the user got it wrong, it took you back to review the points.From my point of view, the only thing I questioned was having a 'bully' as the so-called host. While we are trying to avoid the thought of bullies in school, not sure if the bully should be the one telling us not to bully. Just me opinion, this does not affect the total message or thought of your StAIR. Also, for me it was very informational, but a lot of reading. For younger students, they may get lost in all the reading. I could see this being used for high school and/or middle school level students and an alternate version for the elementary students. This is a tool that could be used by many school districts. Great Job.Technical Remarks:I had some issues clicking links that took you out of powerpoint. I had to re-open the file each time to gain access back to the presentation. This could be my version of powerpoint on my mac or some other technical issue.",5
4227,"This is a topic that I know is very relevant in many students' lives.  I like that you included a portion where students were to write a blog post, as I'm sure they have much to say on the topic, be it personal experiences with bullying, or seeing it happen to a peer.",5

4230,"A great find, I found the Geological dairy to be an amazing collision of history and science as well as insite into such a brilliant mind.  ",4
4230,Very cool Darwin website. This would be perfect when discussing evolution or  talking about Charles Darwin. I liked how this site includes original work form the manuscript.,4
4230,This website is great when looking for information regarding Darwin. Great for completing a research paper or gathering material for a lecture about Darwin and natural selection.,3
4230,"The website isn't coded very well, leading to some blank spaces and making it a little hard to navigate, but it contains all Darwin's works plus relevant supplemental works by other authors.  It even includes all his fantastic sketches (click on the title you want to view from the front page, then click the picture of the finch next to the link).",3
4230,"This is a very interesting site.  It allows for an individual to gain a better understanding of Darwin's conpcepts of natural selection, it is also very easy to use and would be suitable for a middle school setting.",4
4231,"Overall I really like the idea of this project.  I like that it can be used in any region or class.  It can be transferred to a computer software brochure, historical place or somewhere students would like to visit.  The material will make a connection with the students.Technical Remarks:The use and understanding of search engines is huge.  I would like to see some requirement of using different search engines, the students can get very different results.  That would have to be in a 6th grade class though.  I like the option of creating the brochure on computer, I would like to see this pushed a little more.  I understand with lower classes the pen and paper is a better choice but the older ones should be on a computer.",4
4231,"I really like how you are making connections from the lesson to where the students are living to learn more about the historical sites near their home. I think the students will definitely gain more by working collaboratively on the assignment and working to produce a final product rather than simply summarizing their research in a formal essay.I think it's really important that you show the students examples of brochures so that is a critical step in your lesson. Are you assigning each group a specific landmark or are they choosing from a list? I like that you keep your options open by allowing the students to create the brochure on the computer rather than paper, pencil, and glue That could definitely be an extension for students that have higher technology skills or for older students, perhaps. I would be curious to see how you approach identifying reliable sources on the internet since my students really struggle with that concept.Technical Remarks:I like the use of the internet for research purposes as well as word processing. I also like that you leave the option open for students to create the brochure on the computer because that takes the lesson to a higher level technologically.",4

Testing has always been in issue in the organizations I?ve worked in, and this article details not only a framework, but example implementation as well.  Though I?ve never worked with .NET, the ideas presented can easily be transposed to almost any objected oriented language.  This is a good read for anyone concerned about testing, whether they are extreme programming or not.",5

4235,"This looks like a great resource for those who work in this field. The teaching and re-teaching slides look great, as well as the quizzes. The animation and sound effects used are awesome as well. I wouldn't change this is any way unless it were to add a little more information in the teaching section. Great incorporation of instructional strategies (visual aids, videos, text). Capable of reaching learners with multiple learning strategies.",5
4236,"This is a very visually appealing lesson that moved quickly. I enjoyed the videos. Not so long that students would loose interest. A good UDL addition might be an audio button that would read the text to students. The statistics quiz, while surprising and interesting might be hard for the students especially since these weren't taught within the lesson.Good job! Technical Remarks:Embedding the videos directly into the lesson would be ideal. My district generally doesn't give us access to youtube so having the videos embedded would allow greater access.",4
4236,"This lesson is a great tool to bring reality to the students with both text and video for the learner. Also included is a quiz at the end so the kids can learn facts and provide retention. I will say I found the number of statistics a little too much, and might be hard for students to really grasp the point with the multiple number combinations included, especially at the end and all together. You covered covered multiple learning strategies with using both text, video and audio and allowed students who answered questions wrong to go back and try again. Might be better if they are peppered through out the lesson. All in all, a good lesson for students to interact with. Well done.Technical Remarks:Though I was able to access the videos from the lesson, some might not. I did this lesson on my own computer and when I clicked on it, it didn’t open. I simply copied the video URL, clicked out of the “Play Mode” on the presentation and then watched the video. If students are only allowed to view the Kiosk Lesson and not able to esc out of the view, then the videos should be embedded into the page differently to allow easier access.",4
4237,This is a good lesson to promote digital literacy. It seems like the students would enjoy it and it would encourage literacy. It might take a little longer for the students who are slow typers. ,4

I also liked the questions the author listed throughout to make sure her students were understanding the content.  The length was perfect and I liked that the ending referred the students to other resources for continued learning.Technical Remarks:This a power point presentation and from time to time the audio fades a bit.,4
4241,I liked the the closing of this StAIR the best. It rewarded the students for working hard and gave options for students that were really interested in the topic for further exploration.Technical Remarks:The words and pictures loaded really slow and the audio did not play.,4
4242,"Hello!I loved going through this StAIR! It was a fun way to learn about food webs. Ernie was a great way for kids to identify with something. Have you thought about having a voiceover for the questions? It might help students who have trouble reading. The video didn't work, but neither did mine. I noticed the note that said it had to be on the computer in order to view it. Maybe that is why mine didn't work! I clicked on the link that said to click here if you didn't have the video, but it just took me to the next slide. I like that you put in back and home buttons in case students accidentally advance ahead. I did that once, but didn't think to include it in my own StAIR. There were a couple of grammar things you might want to fix. The definition for ""producer,"" and the first sentence on slide 23. I am not trying to pick it apart, I would just want someone to tell me, too! The food webs site is great. If I taught science, I would use it. Your hints are great. They are tailored to the answer that the student gave and not just a back button. The transitions are great. It is a great way for students to focus on only what is needed. When they need the next definition, they click on the word. It keeps them from getting overwhelmed by seeing an entire slide full of text. The falling star was also a great addition!Great job!",5
4242,"This is a great project for teaching students about producers, consumers, and decomposers, and how food chains work. I love the Ernie character that provides steps and directions to the students. The link to the site where students can practice making a food chain and actually print it out is a great addition to this lesson. The only thing I would add to this presentation would be some sound effects just to make it a little more interesting.Technical Remarks:Is the video available somewhere on the web that it could be linked to for those who do not have the video on their computer?",5

4244,"This lesson seemed like a good real life activity for students in that they would be working with a hand-held device. However, a couple elements could use some more thought. I was a bit confused by the intermigling of the instrucotor's part and the student's part. That could just be explained a little more clearly. Also, I think an important element that was missing was how the students/instructors would be assessed. Perhaps after the students came together as a group then they could be led in group feedback.",3
4244,"This sounds like an interesting activity that can be used to teach economic principles. It would be beneficial to know a few key pieces of information however:1) What is the real-world performance that is gained by the actually students participating in the activity? As an educator it would be nice to know what economic principles are being taught.2) What are the objectives for the students? At the end of the activity, what should the students have a better understanding of?3) How exactly are the students assessed? It sounds like there is time for debriefing, however is there any sort of graded activity/quiz to tell if students understand the economic principles that were taught?4) Motivating factors for the educators are discussed, but what about the students? Is the use of the Palm Pilots enough to keep them interested? What exactly do the Solar Wars activities entail? Overall it appears that this lesson could fit into TPACK very well. Technology is used in an effort to teach basic economic principles in an interesting way. A little more detail on exactly what will be done and why wiill help clarify some questions on the Pedagogical and Content components.Technical Remarks:Can this activity only be done using the Palm Pilots or is there other technology that can be used?",3
4245,"Amusing and potentially useful. This demonstrates the jockeying of political candidates in a multi-candidate, multi-issue field. Without the issues, however, it seems somewhat abstract. It is fun to increase the number of candidates and watch them try to position themselves on this political map.",2
4246,"This lesson plan did a great job at hitting all the areas of the TPACK model.  As far as technology, it uses Microsoft word and teaches students how to do various things using word.  It is simple yet teaches many valuable things that students need to know.  Pedagogically, it uses scaffolding by starting with strategies in word then creating a final product of an essay.  As far as content, it teaches students how to use MLA format as well as write a persuasive essay.An idea of something that could be added in the future would be having students use google docs to read other students’ essays or leave comments on them.  The teacher could also view them and leave comments.   Technical Remarks:Uses:Microsoft WordNetbooks",4
4246,Learning how to use Microsoft Word is a skill that every student needs to have throughout their lives for not only school but also their future jobs.  I think its great that you focus on how to use this program with your students because I'll admit there are still things on Word that I'm not even sure how to use.  What I really like about this lesson is that it will be useful and understandable to all your students.  Its great that you have the ability to connect one of the net books to a projector so the students have the ability to see what you're doing as you explain it.  Its also great that your students have computers at their disposal for this activity because their are many learners who need to not only see what you're doing but also do it on their as well in order to retain the information.   ,4
4248,"This lesson has many positives. Firstly, the lesson uses subject matter that will interest students (Ellis Island and Immigration) as well as an age-apropraite website. Students at this level should have no problem exploring the site and learning. In addition, the lesson structure with having students explore the site and then having a whole-class discussion before students start the project is a great strategy to ensure student learning.However, the lesson could be improved. Firstly, a direct reference to state and/or national standards (ex. ISTE) would give the lesson more direction and focus (the specific number for the benchmark stated). In addition, some missing words detract from the credibility. Also, a rubric for grading the group project would provide more perspective to the teacher as well as give students more meaningful feedback. Lastly, the ""1-2 week"" timeline seems somewhat extensive for the completion of the project. The teacher would also have to make sure that students are familiar with the use of PowerPoint and its functions.",3
4248,"Positive Feedback: The lesson provides for ample student choice in how to complete the assignment, PowerPoint, speech, etc. Inviting other classes to watch the presentations makes the assessment more authentic. The “pleasant consequences” and “novelty” components of the motivation section are relevant forms of motivation for most students. The website that accompanies this activity seems age appropriate and is from a reputable source for Education material, Scholstic.com. The lesson seems appropriate for the ability, age, and experience levels of the intended student audience.Critical Feedback: Some basic grammatical errors (missing words) in the lesson plan make it hard to follow and cause the lesson to lose some credibility. The evaluation procedure seems vague because there is no mention of a specific rubric for the presentation and because the evaluation of the Internet research lacks detail, “I will also observe the researching process to see that they can successfully research on the Internet.” Amount of time spent on project “give students a week or two, about 40 minutes a day...” seems both arbitrary and excessive. It seems to be a large amount of time to spend on one such project, especially with all of the standards to be covered and the fact that groups will still have to present. The “meaningfulness” component to the motivation could be stronger and made more diverse. The lesson lacks overall specificity. For example, the researching process as described seems very student directed. Students, especially of this age group, could use more scaffolding and structure for their researching procedures. The lack of specificity of the unit also fails to address many aspects of student diversity, including language barriers and physical and mental disabilities.Technical Remarks:Good use of embedded links in PDF file.",3
4249,"This is a great lesson to teach students the process and benefits of sending e-mail attachments. This is definately a stand alone intructional resource. Through modeling, both visually and orally students will learn how to attach a document. Then students demonatrate their learning by sending their own attachment.Technical Remarks:It seemed to work fine. I kept getting a pop up warning saying that the file extension did not match the file format. It didn't seem to interfere with the lesson though.",5
4249,Your StAIR was organized and easy to use.  This is something I could see myself using with my technology classes.  It is amazing how many students have no idea how to send attachments!  Great job.Technical Remarks:The videos and screencasts provide students the opportunity to view material more than once.  You utlized ULD 3.1 Activate or Supply Background Knowledge.  I also liked how you incorporated your voice into the StAIR with a sound icon so students could listen to what you are saying more than once if needed.  This meets the UDL principal 1.2 offer alternatives for auditory information.,5

4259,"Examining family heritages is an important assignment that often gets students very involved in the process because they can own it and feel specifically connected to the material.  Also, it often gets parents and other family members involved in the process and makes them feel connected to the class.GoogleDocs and Presentations are a great resource for this project, because it can allow you to check in on their progress.  I would suggest having them take their interview notes and information from this research on GoogleDocs so that you can comment on their progress and see if they are on the right track.One goal that is cited in your lesson plan is having the students do online research.  In six grade that process has probably not happened in a true academic sense.  This could be an opportunity to display proper uses of online research and expand upon the purpose of the assignment.  Also, this could be an excellent opportunity to introduce them to the library resources, both physical and digital and show their value.Technical Remarks:In addition to Thomas' remarks about youtube videos, I would suggest creating your own channel.  This will allow you to create a resource that can be valuable to your class in the future and allow for unintended videos not to be displayed as options.",4
4259,"I think the performance objectives for this lesson are great.  I love how you link the general to something specific to each student’s own family history and by creating digital artifacts you will add to potential source material for future historians.  I also think it is great you include information on Angel Island as it seems to be oft forgotten in the shadow of Ellis Island.Will you develop a set of questions for the students, will they develop questions on their own, or will you have them develop that collaboratively, perhaps with guidance from you?One thing I worry about is how you accommodate students of Native-American or of mixed heritage, whether it is a fairly straightforward mix (say one side Italian-American and one side Laotian-American) or one that has been quite mixed up over the generations (for example, there is French-Canadian, English, Irish, Swiss, German and Native-American in my heritage that I know about). Technical Remarks:There are links to YouTube videos which bring up several others on similar topics but also some unrelated videos.  It might be good to have the specific videos you want students to watch embedded somewhere.",4
4260,"I thought this was a good idea for how to engage your students!  I think the students would really enjoy this project overall, as it seems to give them the ultimate choice in where to take this project from a cultural standpoint.  Technical Remarks:A potential boundary I noticed is the requirement for students to have a computer and high-speed internet access at home. Without this piece, they may struggle to keep up with the expectations of this e-portfolio. ",4
4260,"This resource is easy to follow and would be an engaging, rich project for the age group for which it is intended.  The motivational aspect, in particular, seems strong.  The steps as written are easy to follow, and would also be simple to adjust as needed in a specific classroom situation.In reading through this, I began wondering if having a range of sites selected for students ahead of time would be helpful, especially sites at a variety of reading levels.  This can be a challenge, but some students will find the reading on sites they find simply by searching to be too high-level.  I would not recommend limiting them to these sites... Just providing them as an appropriate jumping off point.I wonder a bit about the designation of the project as an e-portfolio.  As I read through it, I felt like it was more of a research product than an e-portfolio.Regardless, this is an engaging, interesting, meaningful lesson plan which could be adapted and modified in myriad useful ways.Technical Remarks:No technical difficulties!",4
4261,"Studying with Online Business School is excellent, and I highly recommend the instutition to other students looking forward to attain a UK degree.

4263,"When students write a research paper, finding original sources can be an issues. With so many website available, it can be overwhelming to find information that is credible. Have a website repository like this, you can send your students here, and they should find all the resources they will need.",4
4264,"This is an Advertisement, so to be fair it should be run all the way through.  The material reall does a good job and in an American classroom, the British English gets their attention.",4
4265,"This resource clearly stated objectives both general to all users and specific to North Carolina curriculum standards and identified a target audience.  The development of the activity supported the objective of learning figurative language terms and demonstrating an understanding by providing students with definitions and examples of the seven terms.  In addition the resource concluded with a review for students to gauge their understanding.  Each question allowed two possible responses.  Users were asked either to state whether an example was identified correctly using true or false or to determine between two choices the correct figure of speech represented.  Either response provided students with feedback stated whether the response was correct or incorrect.This resource evidences the UDL principle of multiple representations.  Users have several options to peruse when working through the identified figurative language terms.  Written definitions, video explanations, a glogster providing multiple representations on its own, and games provide a variety of mediums for students to experience and see the definitions assessed in the review questions at the conclusion of the activity.  All of the representations reinforce the stated objective.The Figurative Language StAIR provides students with a variety of examples to help users develop an understanding of the terms.  One suggestion with regard to feedback would be to provide questions guiding students to continue to consider incorrect responses and direct them back to reference the included videos and definitions or direct students to an alternative resource.  This might prompt students to learn from mistakes made and provide insight and explanation as to why a response was incorrect or correct.In addition to instructional objectives, the activity addresses a real problem in need of being addressed.  The use of the song ""Firework"" helps make the terms real and relevant to students.  Regardless of liking or disliking the song, it provides a recent and popular example of how and where figurative language fits in the real world.",4
4265,"Well Done! I liked that not only did you give a definition of the various types of figurative language, but you also gave an example.  I also liked how in your review section you used a Katy Perry song (and have a link to be able to hear the song). It is important that the students make the connection between songs they hear all the time and figurative language.  Other great songs are: Uncle Kracker ""Smile"" and ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"".  Another idea could be to have the students write their own poem using figurative language.  Overall, the powerpoint was great!Technical Remarks:I couldn't get through to the glogster, but i'm sure it is great!",5
4266,"I liked the specific breakdown of the definitions and the real life application of the material. I think your content and pedagogical decision making was beneficial, as you would intrdoduce mateiral and then quiz the reader over what they have read. However, I had trouble navigating the slides when running through the show. Honestly, I wish I could go back to look at the slides to answer the question. I truly have a short attention span and it takes me extra long to focus (I really relate to adhd kids), so I need time to work through questions by exploring content. I am sure so kids are the same way.",4
4266,What a relevant subject.  I think this would have been a better project if it had better design prinviples applies to it.  Also i was able to continue when i got a incorrect answer.  However this was very effective i can use this for my college club. ,4
4267,"I like this site because it is a one stop shop for tutors on the Internet. This site compiles many different tutoring companies and services to create a nationwide search for tutors. Tutor.com, TutorVista, Crown Tutoring and WyzAnt tutoring services are all listed here for quick access. One draw back is that all the tutors are not directly employed by Tutorz so they can't ensure a 100% response rate to you requests.Technical Remarks:Easy to Use, Google like site construction",4
4267,I like the Tutorz.com website... It actually ended up referring me to another tutoring company.. TutorNation which had the math Tutor I needed.,4
4268,"I was extremely interested in your StAIR. The lesson plan I submitted was actually on reliable sources. I think it's such an essential skill to teach students. I really enjoyed your StAIR. It did a really great job explaining the elements of a reliable source. I also loved your video where you walked through your though process about looking at a website. What a great way for students to see the process of looking at the site. You didn't just ""tell"" them you actually showed them the process. I also loved the quiz because it had students actually visit websites and look around. It gave them hands on experience looking at websites and seeing what aspects were important to focus on. The quiz was helpful because it gave immediate feedback for students to see. I would have liked if when students got it wrong they were sent to a review sheet reminding them why the website wasn't credible. Instead they were able to pick answers until they got it correct. I'm worried my students might just click around until they get it right and not necessarily learn the content. I really think this is a great way to get students practicing and working with credible sources. Awesome job! :)Technical Remarks:When I clicked on ""Go to Material"" it sent me to a screen that said ""No preview available--Download"". So I downloadrd it and it went to a screen that said it couldn't verify viruses ""download anyway"" and so I did and it took me to the actual PowerPoint, not just a StAIR. Not sure if it's my computer or how it was shared.",4
4268,This is a great StAIR! This is very useful to students and teachers of all content areas.  I like that you give information for the students to think about that is probing them to think about reliable website. I like that you have the students identify if the source is reliable or unreliable as well as why it is unreliable. It was great that you were modeling and walking the students through the process of figuring out if a website is reliable. It was good that you explained the thought process while you were determining the website’s reliability. It was a good idea to create a screencast and highlight the specific areas that you were speaking of. It was good that you had the students try to determine reliability to certain websites.  This helps to solidify the information that they have learned.  This was a great StAIR and it is applicable to all teachers. Technical Remarks:THe powerpoint was very easy to open. ,5
4269,Straightforward lesson about the five themes of geography. I like the idea of students getting to pick their region to research. Having students create a concept map and display the five themes of geography for their region is a great way to assess their learning. How will students create this map? Will they have a rubric or some key elements they are required to include? How will they use technology to meet their expectations?Technical Remarks:No issues.,4
4269,Great basic lesson using a concept map.  An excellent idea to graphically display the 5 themes of geography.  It is also a great way to introduce the subject for students who need to see the 5 themes in a more visual manner.Technical Remarks:What program would it use?  Is it on paper?,4
4269,This lesson  was an overview of the five themes of geography. The content contained a real-world connection and useful information for the future. The lesson allowed for research and discussion.One thing I wold include would be the use of  a collaborative forum to enhance the discussion of teh geographical areas and possible create the map/project online so that it would be easily collaborated on and shared.Technical Remarks:no issues,3
4270,"The main reason this page gets 4 stars is because I was surfing for Classroom Managment techniques and happened upon some *great* advice for the FL classroom.  We tend to want our students to talk, but how many of us are constantly saying ""no hablen ingles!""  From the grave, my high school Spanish teacher (and Foreign Language legend!), Marilyn Barrueta, was giving advice.  I had read a few of her wonderful postings before actually seeing her name as the author and was moved.  Even though I had Barrueta ""baggage"" that followed me my whole life, it was that baggage that inspired me to begin teaching at age 35.  I am now a middle school teacher who wishes I knew even half of what she knew.  This web page is a start.",4

The site can be used by language learners, tourists, travelers and linguists.The volunteer approach is  very appealing.Technical Remarks:easy to use",4
4272,I really like the science notebook idea.  This site is a great starting place to implement them in the classroom.  I especially liked the large list of links regarding this topic.,4
4273,"This resource provides students with a variety of representations for fractions.� Some problems provide mathematical statements with fractions.� Other scenarios provide visual representations with circles.� Still other aspects of the activity demonstrate fractions using fraction bars.� This in turn provides options for users to select methods to represent fractions that makes the most sense to them and is most clear.� An huge added benefit were the links to online fraction manipulatives.� This provides users with strategies to solve the problems based on how fractions were modeled within the activity.� The format and ease of use for the online manipulatives encourages users to visualize the problem using manipulatives without eliminating modeling options for the problem.�Another benefit of this resource resides in the amount of choice and means of expression provided to the user.� As mentioned above, options for modeling fractions linking students to a tool for creating the model.� The activity also provided feedback to students either congratulating and articulating why a solution was correct or giving a hint for students to consider before returning the problem.� This helps students identify and correct misconceptions of fractions.Fraction Frenzy provides users with several choices to explore fractions.� Multiple media forms are presented to develop student understanding such as video, interactive fractions and manipulatives, games, and cool math tutorials.� Students can select from the additional resources listed to enhance their understanding and further investigate the different types of fractions discussed.� One other unique resource presented were the three digital stories from Storybird.� I had never experienced a resource such as this!� I imagine presenting this information in a storybook format might help increase student motivation and relevance of the material.",4
4273,"Fractions are fun!!! This resource presents fractions in an understandable way with lots of pictures and links to extra materials for students who like extra practice.The pictures were actually the most important part for me, especially in the equivalent factions section where it was so clear how some of the fractions were equal. In contrast, some of the slides were a little word heavy. Luckily the icons and audio helped to break up some of slides into smaller information bits. 'There were quizzes after each of the mini-lectures making sure that students understood the presented material. Right answers were rewarded with a thumbs-up :) and wrong answers were explained in a very clear and understandable manner.In all, I would recommend this resource very strongly. As a teacher, I would actually prefer to use this in the front of the room because there is sooooo much good information in it!!! However, it can easily be used by students alone. Enjoy!Technical Remarks:Technically, this was very easy to use. Each step was explained clearly so that if a student isn't sure how to use PPT, this will make it very easy for them to use the resource. The only problem was that since clicking anywhere on the slide caused it to advance, it was impossible to click on some of the links. That said, the links were brilliant!!! There are so many useful resouces (including games - yay!!) all of which build on students understanding of fractions.",5
4273,I thought this STAIR taught a lot of really important concepts. It also included guided instruction and allowed for independent practice. There was a mix of helpful tutorials and fun videos as well. Students would really enjoy practicing fractions this way. Great job!Technical Remarks:I had some issues with the navigation buttons. They didn't always lead me to where it said they would lead me.,4

4275,"I have used these on-line dictionaries extensively on an as-needed basis for German and French. It is very easy to obtain a translation for a given word from the dictionary, though generally only one translation without further description is given. This makes it a good tool for someone with experience in the language who has forgotten or needs a specific piece of vocabulary. Ideal for on-line tasks, since the lookup is quick and one does not need to leave the task to look for a book.Technical Remarks: The dictionaries are self-installing executables. After installation one simply clicks on ""search"" to look up words. Switching between english-foreign and foreign-english is done by clicking on the flags on the home screen. There is an ""add"" feature as well as a ""Practice"" feature for drill. ",5
4276,"This Stand alone instruction has some great resources. The words spoken for the student are a great resource. It is helpful that there is an outside practice as wel.. I think this could be really useful for students, but they might need to use it more than once to really cemment the concept.Technical Remarks:There were some pages that I wanted to go back and review before answering questions. I think it would also be useful to provide students with a chart, or have duel screens when they are completing the outside practice.",4
4276,"   This is a stand-alone instruction resource for French -er verb conjugation.  I think this resource used a good scaffolding of instruction. I really like the use of the internet site Languagesite.org as it allows the student to practice and hear the words with correct conjugation and pronunciation.  It addresses different learning styles by allowing them to hear, see, and practice the words.  Technical Remarks:     There were some pages that I wanted to go back and review before I answered the questions, but there wasn't an option to go back.       Maybe adding some support when the student answers the question, whether it be right or wrong, that would help reinforce the concepts.",4
4277,"There are many things I liked about this activity! I thought that it was very easy to use because it provided firm guidance throughout the kiosk. I liked the idea of a little practice before actually answering some questions throughout the activity. This helps student to be familiar with the content before jumping into something. I also liked the diverse forms of questionnaire. It changed things up as oopse to being so standard. I really enjoyed the sound effects! I thought that this made the kiosk exciting and enjoyable. The EdModo application is a great source of assessment not just for the students but the teachers as well. It keeps all the quizzes together in one spot and gives you immediate feedback on how effective your lesson was.Some things that would've made this kiosk more resourceful to diverse users is indicating with a change of color, animation or an additional slide that the question they got incorrect was wrong. By providing other modes of perception, students who may have a hearing impairment or visual impairment could also benefit from this a bit more. Another thing that would have been beneficial is different types of questions. Such as true and false or having them find errorrs. I also think that a change of slide theme would make it more fun, brighter colors may have made it a bit more exciting!Overall, this Kiosk was great and helpful and would definitely be wonderful in any French classroom!Technical Remarks:Make sure that sound is on when using this in the classroom. If not, students will not know if they answered questions correctly or incorrectly.",5
4278,Very good presenation and terrific graphics to support information.  I like that it was easy to follow along and interact even for a novice.  I think students will enjoy the opportunity to interact!   Great job!Technical Remarks:Audio was a little hard,4
4278,Tres bien! I enjoyed the interactive concept using the recorded responses. I think that the images were clear and guided me to speak the appropriate words. Technical Remarks:My only remark on technical would be that I did find it hard at times to understand the recording clearly due to the microphone. ,4
4278,Very nice resource for the French classroom.,5
4279,I like that the lesson uses a real life situation and asks students to participate.  Students are learning and the teacher is meeting curriculum standards while engaing students in a fun format using a dynamic socialization skill.  Well done!,5
4279,Conversational activities always seemed to help me when I learned another language and this lesson challenges the students to do it in a way that sparks creativity and imagination which will allow the experience to be memorable. ,4
4280,This is a good resource to have.  I like the different experiments it includes.,4
4283,There is only one image and no obvious link to advance to more images or examples to compare flux.  No materials on how to use it or references to compare what the flux would/should be.  Also no directions on how to first draw the box to make a flux measurement.  But a nice idea - needs more development time.,2
4284,"Wow what a great video and TED talk! An interesting subject to have at TED, but i really enjoyed it. I loved the biological and genetic aspect of her presentation.",5
4284,Really good Ted talk. It addresses a topic that needs to be addressed and I like how an actual supermodel is able to deliver this personal message.,4
4284,"I cried watching this! Talk is applicable to any field, any race, gender, or age. Not scientific, but wonderful.",5
4285,This resource on sickel cell anemia could be really great for a high school biology project.  It always helps to connect what students are learning to something concrete.,4
4286,This is an interesting article that reinforces the ideas that science is alive. This is the kind of material that will help spark a student's interest in science.,3
4286,Interesting article. I didn't know these microcontinents even existed. Makes sense though.,3
4286,"An intresting find on the topic of geology, I would be intrested in viewing a simutation of projected movement of this microcontinent. ",3
4286,"The news article was interesting, but not necessarily trustworthy. The research article attached to it was unavailable aside from the abstract. I would like to learn more about this subject, but the evidence given was insufficient in my opinion. ",2
4286,This just goes to show that there are so many things that we have not discovered in the world. very interesting!,4
4287,"This is a great resource! It's short, simple, thorough, and to the point (and VERY easy - no added length or fluff to extend the resource). I enjoyed how you actually had to interact with the resource instead of just interacting with the quiz portion, it helps keep the student engaged in the resource and would probably help them pay more attention.The three state standards were covered, and covered in detail too without just stating what they are. Your voice was very clear, calm, and easy to follow and understand. As far as UDL, I think things were very well put in place in the resource (arrow pointing, interactive clicking, etc). The only thing I think that could be added could be closed captioning at the bottom of the resource - but that depends on whether or not it's possible with the technology you used.The only comment for improvement I would have would be add a few more quiz questions. Maybe by adding one or two per part could help the student pay attention more or help them retain information longer. Other than that great job!Technical Remarks:Great use of interaction in the resource. This should really help captivate and engage students!",5
4287,"Ease of the resource: The video tutorial was easy to follow. For some areas as the narrator said, ""Click....here."" YOu had to literally click on that area on the screen with your local mouse. I believe most would understand how to carry on with this after the first click. It kept your attention in a good way. The video flowed nicely overall.Specific Comments: The state standards were covered. This was done in a fast and efficient way. Wen most people see standards they drift off but the narrator kept it short and used a highlighting technique in the Camtasia software that illuminated the important parts and kept me interested. The narrator used a clam and clear voice the entire time. I enjoyed that very much. The one question quizzes were inserted in the right spots the correct number of times. Call outs and screen signal drawings were appropriate to direct viewers eyes. Things that could have been added could have been some additional Blog information on set up such as a short overview of the menu tabs under ""Design"" just so creators knew where to explore the possibilities for their blogs. This may have added some excitement about the personalization for students who crave to make something their own.UDL Principles, instructional strategies, instructional design, web or product design: The video enable viewers to participate with the instruction in many ways through clicking cues and quizzes to maintain interest and follow steps as they would when they go to create their own blog. It uses both auditory and visual information for learning. The callouts (screen writings, arrows, circles) can help aid those ESL students who may need the extra pointing out of hot spots. He refers to the blog the students will be creating for he class and gives them real life actions they will have to do for their blog. He does not go into detail about too much to minimize distractions. This can be a good thing since there are so many different blog choices, themes, and colors that can overtake the true meaning of the blog.Technical Remarks:Technical Remarks: The quiz results at the end were shown to me and I had the choice to e-mail them to the creator. This is a wonderful aspect of Camtasia. However, I did send my quiz results to the creator and it did get sent back to me as a undeliverable e-mail. I am not sure if this was on purpose or due to error.",4
4288,"I really enjoyed this lesson introducing students to blogging.  As the author said, blogging is everywhere in our world, and students need to understand their inner workings. I felt that the most effective part of the lesson is its ability to reach a diverse range of learners.  Regardless of the student's level, they can contribute something to a blog.  The lower performing students will create posts that demonstrate understanding and meet the requirements, while a higher performing student will have the flexibility to go above and beyond.Another positive feature of this lesson is its interactivity.  Students will read each others postings and reply to them with comments and questions.  Not only will it expose the students to alternate points of view, but the knowledge that your post will be read by your classmates creates another level of accountability.The fact that the students' postings will be available online to view at home, or share with far-away relatives, creates a sense of pride in their work that I'm sure would lead to quality performance.Overall, I found this to be a great book report blog sharing activity.  I feel that it would greatly engage the students, allow the chance for all students to be successful, and foster a culture of sharing quality writing.",4
4288,"I have used this resource with my 4th graders in Reading. The students were asked to write a scary story to post on the blog and share with classmates, friends, and family. These blog stories will be highlighted and linked to Voicethread to be shared at our Reading Night. The students truly enjoyed creating and publishing their work. They show great excitement when posting to the blog and strive to show their best work.",5
4289,Great lesson for department administrators to utilize. Took a different angle and used NETS specifically for administrators.Technical Remarks:Could add an interactive video that shows an administrator explaining the petition in addition to training slides,4
4289,"Very informative and full of details! Great job explaining in detail what administrators have to do to complete the process. By providing examples and scenarios to the administrators, you definitely help them out while working through the application process. Not only will it make their lives easier, but yours as well! Tutorials and training slides are also a great idea to help the administrators learn how to use the INSzoom database. I’ve learned from personal experience, that a FAQ (frequently asked questions) link is very helpful. By providing this link you are giving your administrators a quick reference area they can visit on their own, instead of asking you the questions you are constantly asked. I think you did a good job meeting instructional strategies by providing discussions, tutorials, and helpful links. I also think you did a good job meeting several UDL principles. Overall I think you did a great job, included lots of helpful details, and it’s very informative!",4
4290,What a pleasure it must be to work with Seniors. I always feel like Seniors are more mature to handle the literacy research. The students are very fortunate to have such a well thought out lesson plan. I like how you present/introduce the material to them through a Youtube clip.You increase their presentations to be successful by supplying a research graphic organizer and the vocabulary words that they should incorporate into their lesson. Their personal blogs allow freedom to expresss their real feelings about the project. The collaboration of group members will promote critical thinking. The idea of presenting Walt Whitman as one of their own is very creative. I like how you have divided the poem equally between the groups.Technical Remarks:The iPad is a great incentive and a great tool for the students to use. Students create blogs and Webquests.,5
4291,I had never thought of learning English with these issues.  Since it is my first language I have never associated the need to learn my vowels in such a way because I grew up knowing them.  The powerpoint seemed like a good introduction.Technical Remarks:Have you thought about having the students use powerpoint to make their own flashcards dealing with the vowels and sounds? This way they could learn associations with words that are easy for them to remember.,4
4292,"I think this lesson has a lot of promise. I remember studying Romeo and Juliet in high school and we had a similar final project. However, I think doing some of this work in between reading the acts would have been helpful. I was a little confused by some of the collaboration work: it says students will be texting or tweeting each other, but it doesn't say which areas they will be doing this (during the reading or during the final project). I think you could also add a component where they tie the R&J story to other works, both Shakespearean and more modern.Technical Remarks:Just a little more clarification on where the group work would take place, if anywhere. I think some of the technology related projects may need a little background work with some students who are less familiar but many could pickup the skills easily and help others in the class.",4
4292,"I like that you are taking Shakespeare and using web 2.0 skills to create active learning for the students. I think that the students will definitely gain understanding through a discussion with each other via blogs or tweets, but are they discussing the material in class prior to beginning the online discussion? I'm a little unclear on how the lesson actually progresses from the ID lesson plan. Do the students work individually on the final project or will they be in groups? How do you ""translate"" the information prior to the blogs/tweets?Technical Remarks:Depending on the school, not all of the students will have the web 2.0 skills for all of these activities. They should definitely learn them prior to graduating high school, but I know that the freshman in my district won't all know how to manage an e-portfolio or create a podcast. These are great tools to use for this lesson, but the teacher may need to take class time to teach these skills.",4
4293,Great work Rob.  I will be sharing this with the other APs and athletic directors that I know.  It will come in handy throughout the school year.You could also use something similar to inform clubs about policies and changes to fundraising or refresh information from the previous year.   ,5
4293,"This looks like a great way to take much of the everyday items that somehow tie up meetings (and often take away from newer issues that need to be discussed), chop it down, and spend meeting time more wisely. Good job!",4
4293,Very well reasoned and concise. The availability of the content online after initial viewing helps to ensure that any questions down the line can be answered on the user's own time and exactly in line with the school policies- no room for misinterpretation.Technical Remarks:Use of multiple colors makes it very easy to discern information from commentary. Very easy to read.,4
4294,These were great to look at to re-inforce the learning that I have already received thusfar. This would be beneficial in future classes for other students to see examples of what completed projects and webpages look like. This could be a great reference item.,4
4295,This is a very time-relevant module specially with so much emphasis these days on cloud-based computing. The best thing about implementing Google Apps in educational environment is that it requires such minimum training. The lesson plan addresses the NETS-S standards appropriately and uses the overlapping strategies of Cooperative Learning and Technology Integration very well.Technical Remarks:Easily readable within the browser window.,5
4295,"I think this is a very relevant lesson plan. Many public and private schools are using Google Apps. I think a more specific lesson plan for each type of document would be very useful, since there are so many features available. As for instructional strategies, sharing and collaborating with others is a great motivation for teachers and students. I’m glad that one to one assistance is required since general presentation aren’t sometimes as effective, it all depends on the technology skills of each student.",5
4296,"I thought this was a very good lesson on using Google Calendars. It was organized and sequential, gave a good amount of information and did not go too fast. It was presented in an easy to understand way and had practical examples of the benefits of Google Calendar.The StAIR itself was visually appealing and used bubbles, zooming and other effects to draw the users focus to the task at hand.Technical Remarks:This lesson runs fine and has no noticable technical flaws.",5
4296,"This lesson was very appropriate for students as well as adults. I personally just started using google calendar and I learned some things. I liked the big ""bubbles"" that were shown that explained things. I also thought it was appropriate to have the pauses, because it took me a while to process the information.Technical Remarks:Everything worked great!",4
4296,"Great lesson on using Google calendar. Very appropriate for students as well as adults new to using the calendar function. I especially like the ""pauses"" for the user to think and click on the parts of the calendar as they were being discussed. This would be helpful for users who need a little more time to process the info or take notes.Technical Remarks:Everything worked well for me!",4
4297,"This is a great introduction to Google Docs and how to create your own Google Doc.  I like that the tutorial goes through most of the options of Google Docs including the discussions or ""chat"" feature.  In my experience with Google Docs, the chat feature has been a great way to collaborate on shared documents and create final products with a group. Technical Remarks:Everything worked great on the tutorial!",5
4298,"This video is a great introduction of how to use the Google Presenter Tool.  I really liked that the video had a ""highlighted"" cursor that showed exactly where you find features and edit information.  The video goes through all the simple steps and shows the similarities with Microsoft Powerpoint.  This video has the audio and visual component so that all students (and adult learners) can follow along with creating their own Google Presentation. Technical Remarks:None",5
4298,"Your tutorial on Google Presentation was easy to understand the different aspects of the presentation application. It was easy to follow, especially since your cursor was highlighted the entire time and the large arrows were pointing toward important features. The assessment at the end highlighted the main points that you hoped users would learn about by watching your tutorial video. I think you hoped users would be creating a presentation while they were watching the tutorial, so maybe making that more clear in the beginning would be my suggestion to make the tutorial more interactive.Technical Remarks:Some of the assessment questions were not fully shown on the screen or were cut off. Also, my video paused itself frequently during the video. I think you were hoping the users were completing the steps as they watched, but the pauses were not always at the appropriate places. You might consider having users manually pause if needed.",4
4298,"Your video resource was very easy to follow along.  I liked how you had the clicker highlighted the entire time so that the viewer could easily follow along with what you were describing.  This really helped guide through what you were showing on the screen.  I liked how you asked the viewer to practice inserting a video into their own personal Google Presentation.  I think that it might be nice to add more of those “your turn” moments into the video.  You could have the viewer practice adding other editors and so forth, similar to what you described in the tutorial.  The quiz at the end was a really nice way of summing up the student learning.  I am just curious (not sure if this can be done), but is there a way that if the answer is wrong people can be guided back to a certain section of the video?  For example, if they missed a question that was described at minute 2, they would be redirected to a clip of that section.  I am not sure if that is feasible, but I think could be a pretty cool feature if it is possible.Overall, this was a very clear tutorial.  The quiz and “you try” section helped make it more interactive.  Good job!Technical Remarks:It may have been my personal computer, but I had times when the video stopped and I had to hit the play button again to continue (even though the button on the bottom did not indicate it was saved).  Once I figured out that this was all I needed to correct, the tutorial worked very smoothly.",4
4299,"This presentation is very user-friendly and I would find it quite useful if I were applying to grad school...well done!  It is easy to navigate, not confusing in the least and I love how the slides incorporate the option to choose ""right on track"" or ""in need of assistance"" type options.  With the use of these two options, this PowerPoint is well directed towards students who are just getting started with applying to grad school, or students who are ahead of the game and just have some questions.I loved the ""Fab Five"" heading and find it clever and resourceful.  The presentation takes the user through each of the recommended requirements step by step and the grad school expectations.  It includes helpful tips and hints. The ""refresher"" option on the last page is an excellent addition for those who may have additional questions or need a reminder on a particular topic.  Overall, great work!Technical Remarks:Due to the slideshare, I was not able to click on some of the extra links, but know that would not be the case on the actual PowerPoint presentation.",4
4299,"In terms of ease of use, I had to click on multiple links from MERLOT to get to the resource, even though the presentation has its own direct link (I preferred the direct URL rather than embedded in a blog or full screen).The description on MERLOT provides a good summary; it is clear who the presentation is directed at and what the resource contains.  The StAIR met the expectations put in place by the description.In terms of the presentation itself, the aesthetics are good and seem appropriate for undergraduate students.  There is a good amount of content on each slide - enough to be informative, but not overwhelming.  I appreciated the additional links for students who want to learn more.  The presentation is broken up into reasonable sections and the bullet points make it easy to follow and understand.  Overall, the presentation is a good introduction for undergraduates looking for information on applying to grad school.  It truly does stand alone and is short enough that students will not lose interest.  It seems that it would be best for sophomores and juniors who are in the early stages of pulling together their resume, references, personal statement, etc.I would have liked to see a little more specificity as to whether the presentation applies to all graduate schools, just the liberal arts, music, education, etc., although the presentation is general enough that it is likely to be useful to all.  Clarification regarding GPA and the tier of graduate school a student might expect to get into could also be useful in terms of managing expectations.  The presentation alternates between phrases and sentences within bullets; consistency would be nice (at least within the same slide).  There are a few minor punctuation errors, but none that majorly detract from the effectiveness of the presentation. The presentation relies primarily on text to convey its message; images, video or audio could have been useful to help illustrate key points and address the learning needs of a wider range of students.  The text, however, is usually well-phrased and conveys energy and enthusiasm that will draw students in and make the presentation more enjoyable for students to work through.Technical Remarks:While the links to move forward and backward within the presentation worked, the ones intended to send you to other slides within the presentation did not.  I have had this problem with other presentations on slideshare, but tried multiple web browsers, so I am not sure what the problem is.  If it is due to operating system/browser requirements, it would be useful to know what those specifications are.  I also wish that the URLs to additional outside resources were hyperlinks, so the viewer could just click and go, rather than having to copy and paste the link.",4

4302,I really like this lesson plan.  I think that it is very well thought out in design.  I like that the students are working together in groups face to face as well as collaborating online.  I think that this will help the students make more mearningful connections.  It will also help them learn together about online resources that will be helpful to them in the future.  One thing that I think you should include in the plan is an overview of what diingo is.  I have an idea but others may not be familiar with what it is or how to use it for their classrooms.  I think if you could give a basic overview about diingo and its features it would make using this lesson easier.   Another thing that I think would be beneficial to the students is for them to share the information they have learned with each other.  I think that they should be required to look over so many projects and comment on them or else have them do some sort of presentation so that the other students can learn from each of the group.Technical Remarks:I would include the link to diingo in the lesson plan so that it is easier to access the site.  This way you can just click on the hyperlink and be taken directly to where you need to be.  I think it could save time while working on the project.,4
4303,I could use some of the tips to educate my Garden Club students about container gardening.,4
4304,Not sure how this demo can be used except to see point by point daily rainfall or hourly rainfall for a single day of your choice,3
4305,"I like that this particular lesson focuses on a goal-oriented topic.  Most kids will need to know how to apply for graduate school and this lesson plan focuses on just that.  I appreciate how it incorporates technology and can be more meaningful for kids to use.  This topic relates to students' lives and also is a user-friendly format. Kids will be able to navigate through the Prezi in a way that makes sense to the individual.  It is also a wonderful way for students to be able to resolve questions that they have about applying for graduate school.  I feel that this is a well-written lesson plan with a clear direction in mind.  It asks that students interact with materials and one another, which covers the social aspect of the lesson and also alleviates some of the pressure that comes along with such an overwhelming experience such as applying to grad school.I like how this lesson involves a step by step process of how to apply to graduate school, which can be such a chore to many.  However, when integrating technology, it becomes more of an exciting experience and many questions will be answered.Technical Remarks:There are no issues and I think using Prezi and Google Docs is a wonderful way to integrate technology",4
4305,"Regarding ease of use; I appreciate that this lesson plan opens right up into a published Google Doc, making it easy to view and/or print.  Since it is suggested that the user incorporate resources specific to their university, it might have been nice to have a version that is easier to download, copy or modify, but this is a somewhat minor issue.I like that the lesson plan includes a variety of instructional methods and teaches a very applicable skill (applying to graduate school), albeit a very specific and somewhat limited one.  Each section of the lesson plan is clear and to the point, making the overall lesson plan easy to follow and understand.  I like the use of a Prezi to convey information, as students will be able to work at their own pace and can reference each section as much or as little as they need to.  The samples and checklist/template included in the Prezi will help students understand each point and give them a starting point for their next step(s).  I also appreciate the interaction with an academic advisor that is written into the lesson plan; I think students often do not know who to turn to for information, so it’s nice to give them a resource. I would have appreciated a more specific method regarding how the lesson will be implemented.  It is unclear to me if it is expected that students will approach an advisor, if the advisor will send the Prezi to all of his/her students, introduce the Prezi at a meeting/presentation, etc.  I think there are a variety of methods that would work well with this lesson plan; perhaps a list of suggested methods of implementation is all that is necessary, as institutions would be customizing the lesson plan to their own resources anyway.Technical Remarks:I did not encounter any technical difficulties with this resource.It seems the final product of this lesson plan would have good integration of technology that will hold student interest.",4
4306,Lots of resources for the classroom. Great tool that can be used to help our students. ,5
4308,"Great subject to cover with your students. This lesson is well organized and incorporates individual, small group, full class, and internet research aspects. The objectives and standards are well defined and the lesson accomplishes what it was designed to do. I will use this lesson in my classroom.",4
4308,"The objective and benchmark standards were very clear and the procedure of the lesson was organized with the time for each task in the lesson. Students have opportunities to work independently, with peers, and with inquiry using the internet. Having student act out how a bill becomes a law allows students to both connect with the content and to apply the knowledge in real work context.",4
4309,"This StAIR did an excellent job of defining a clear aim for the learner.  I gained a clear understanding of how to access ebooks via both the Follet and Kindle applications.  The easy to understand and logical approach of the presentation allowed for scaffolding of ideas to naturally flow.  The topic itself was not overly engaging in itself, but the author did a tremendous job of introducing interesting colors and effects shaped by a fun and very well done narration video.  Engagement being central to success - this presentation really held my attention.If I had to suggest a way to improve upon this StAIR, I would suggest a means to review the information for a variety of ability levels.   Review or reverse tabs could help with this.Really think this was a well done, fun, and well sequenced  presentation!Technical Remarks:From a technical standpoint, it was interesting to see the difference in the amount of time that it took for me to access the presentation from work versus home.  I had no problem at work, and I enjoyed the benefits of the narration.  Unfortunately, I must have lacked the necessary plug ins or something, but the narration did not work at home.  As a large file with the amount of video embedded, I wonder if it would be possible to compress the file?Very small thing, but the link on the right answer for the first question did not work.Creative use of technology that made for a truly enhanced learning experience!",5
4309,"This is a great StAIR project. It was entertaining to watch the presentation and it also provided detailed information on how to access ebooks through the school's library. I am sure any student who sees this presentation in the classroom will be clear on how to get ebooks either through Kindle or Follett applications on their IPads, laptops, or ebook readers.The presentation itself was really easy to navigate and the scaffolding of information was easy to follow. The narration provides extra support in understanding the material. The color and visuals is a great strategy which provides the students with relevant information about what something is or what something looks like. I also like the strategy used of comparing and contrasting items. For example giving the pros and cons of using the Kindle application versus using the ebook reader. Under the UDL Guidelines this provides the student with a chance to choose the appropriate item which will work better for him or her and at the same time providing more autonomy.Although, this is a great informational tool, I have a couple of suggestions that hopefully will improve its purpose. One, although the visuals are a great idea, I feel as though there is too much happening all at once. For example, on some slides while one is trying to listen and watch the videos, you also have the task to read the information on the slide. I believe, this can be a bit too overwhelming for a young student; maybe it can be set as showing the video first and the provide the written information. Second, I would also recommend stating in the presentation that written instructions will also be provided. This can be extremely helpful for students who need to see the written material in order to recall information. Overall, this is an excellent tool and I am sure students will benefit from it.Technical Remarks:First of all this file is 85mbs. It is a big file. So if you have a slow connection it will take a long time to download. Also I would suggest using back button options, just in case students want to browse back the previous slide. On the quiz, the first question's right answer does not have a link. I would also inform the students to adjust their volume or use headphones.",5
4310,"I really liked your presentation.  It was nice that the students had choice in their option- not all students think and organize information the same so that was a nice added feature.  The video tutorials you created within the Option 1 and Option 2 instructions were great.  A nice feature to add would be to have some similar instruction videos in the introduction section where students are learning how to use Google Drive and Spreadsheets.  It was nice to have the option to learn directly from Google as well, though.  I really liked to overall look of the project as well.  It creates a user friendly feel and I think kids would take to it easily.  A suggestion I have is to add something at the end that finishes the project.  I wasn't sure when the project was done; I had to check the slide I was on to see if I was finished or not.  Technical Remarks:Very easy to use.  Each of the tutorials are linked back to the home screen which is helpful. ",4
4310,"This resource provides the student with so much detail in working with Google Drive and creating a spreadsheet. A student could easily work through this lesson on their own. While this resource is geared towards a specific type of budget, the skills learned are easily transferrable to other types of budgets and the real world.Technical Remarks:Easy to navigate",4
4310,"The information provided is very precise and technical, and the detail used in this presentation is phenomenal, I truly enjoyed going back and forth using this wonderful tool. I just wish I had a place to go. I liked the fact that I was learning multiple aspects of a spreadsheet I like the pictures provided with the information. Also, traveling back and fourth using the links was easy.  I know that student would not be able to use this resource without previous experience as comfortably as an adult, so, it would be nice it they had a tutorial video or lesson.  Technical Remarks:No problems",4
4310,"This is a very neat idea for students to learn Google Spreadsheets. The powerpoint contains links that work and gives great examples for each step. The information is very detailed with pictures.It is very technical and there is a lot going on, on the slides. It would be nice if the students had an opportunity or links to watch a video explaining it as an added resource. It also does not include feedback or an explanation of how the students will be evaluated on their task.Technical Remarks:Students will need a computer that has Microsoft Powerpoint.",4
4311,"This site is good start to really getting someone excited to learn a lesson.  The content is there, but it lacks some desgin elements that would be more engaging.  But as a teahcing tool and content motivator to learn a language, I think it is very good.",3
4312,"This presentation provides a step by step explanation of how a checking account works. The target audience is special needs students. The information is basic, and is highlighted with key words. The presentation uses goal oriented design principals that focus on students understanding checking accounts.Technical Remarks:The presentation runs as a power point show. A few of the links are quirky, but there is a large amount of valuable content here. Timings and sound are used to help different learning styles. ",5
4313,"A wonderful, comprehensive look that not only establishes expectations, but also teaches valuable historical analysis skills. Contains great examples for every point it makes, visually appealing (especially the portion dealing with source analysis).Content rich presentation, that does not talk down to readers and allows multiple opportunites to test comprehension.Technical Remarks:Functional, fluid, Kiosk-style PowerPoint. highly recommended for students learning about the first tier of historical analyisis in either middle school or high school.",5
4313,I really link this StAIR! The infusion of the various media along with an explanation is very useful! The varied formats used for practice were also great! Additionally how to study is a VERY valuable and often overlooked skill set which needs to be taught! A change I would suggect is possibly a google doc or something where the students can turn in the assignments online so the StAIR's not completely tied to the classroom and the students have the ability to do this outside of class.,5
4314,"I really enjoyed your StAIR. Last year was the first year I experimented with Twitter in the classroom. And I did it more as voluntary thing with my blended class. The only way I used it was to tweet homework assignments. I liked that you gave the basics like how to sign up, what the different elements were called, and how to actually use the site. Even as a Twitter person (I have a personal one, school one, and Master's class one), I still felt like I was learning some new information and reviewing content. It seemed easy to use and I liked that it let me skip things I already knew and click on things I needed more help with. That's a great way to format your StAIR, especially with professionals who want to embrace the content. I liked that there were arrows and blue boxes to really highlight what you were talking about. As someone who is familiar with Twitter I was fine with the information. However, it may be a bit much for someone new to it. A few slides had a lot of text and several choices to click. It didn't hinder my use of the StAIR at all. I also liked at the end there were additional resources and your contact information. I would definitely reference the StAIR again and even use it to give myself a refresher before I taught it to my students or other colleagues.Technical Remarks:One of the last slides listed the different content areas and gave ways to use Twitter in that content area. I was anxious to click on the Language Arts one, so I could get some ideas for my class. However, the different content areas weren't hyper-linked. ",4
4314,"As someone who is just starting to experiment with using Twitter in the classroom this StAIR was quite helpful.  Although I am familar with Twitter I experimented with the portion of the StAIR for those that were not and thought that section could be a great help in the classroom when setting students up with a Twitter account.  the other section, which gave ideas on how to use twitter in a classroom was quite informative and I appreciated the screencast that gave a tour of twitter.  It was a great way to model the various uses.  I also felt that the quizzes offered feedback and provided an authentic check of one's ability to use and interact with twitter. Overall, this StAIR would be great for anyone interested in using twitter in their classroom and, with a few adjustments, could be used to teach students how to use twitter to enhance their own learning.  Technical Remarks:Very easy to download.  Some buttons on the actual StAIR were a bit hard to find, but it did not affect my experience in using it.  ",4
4315,"I think your lesson plan will be a great resource for your work. It sounds like something that we could really use at Bay Mills Community College. Our IT is so busy that they just don’t have the time to come show us how to use certain technologies that are available to us, or we learn it once and forget it all. Having a video demo library would be excellent. Technical Remarks:The only thing that I would suggest would be to maybe have an area where instructors and administrators could comment on how useful the video was or add their own tips and tricks for future video viewers.",5
4315,"This is a great adaptation of flipped instruction to the work world.  The repository of tutorial videos is a great approach to the problem of providing training to new employees.  While face to face training is more personal, the videos allow uses to review them on their own time.  Often times new employees can experience information overload during orientation meetings, but with this repository, they can get the information when they need it.  It wasn’t specifically stated in your lesson plan, but I assume that you intend to add closed captioning to the videos so they fall more in line with UDL principles.  The lesson plan was easy to follow and well created.  Thanks for sharing.    ",4

4327,"What stood out to me were the different opportunities for students to be involved in this lesson. For example, students work in different groups, role play, and use technology to create a collaborative classroom environment. This lessons allows students to take ownership over their contribution to the classroom environment.Technical Remarks:Found in Google Drive",4
4327,"This is a thorough lesson plan designed to help teachers build a learning community in their classroom. I appreciate that student interaction varies during the course of this lesson including whole-group discussion and small-group problem-solving. Students experience community acitivites throughout their lives, and a learning community should be no different.Technical Remarks:Lesson is in GoogleDrive.",4
4328,"This lesson (intended for a 9-12 grade web-design class) that covers creating a professional webpage (equip with specific pieces like information forms and data collection) is very well planned from start to end. The intended goal for the students is made very clear and understandable for the age group. The author chooses to begin the lesson by activating background knowledge of the students by stimulating a class discussion about “good” and “poor” websites, and also asking for specific feelings about entering personal information into a form on a website. This sets the stage for the learners and by providing models of these sites on a large viewing screen illustrates the idea further through non-linguistic representation- allowing the audience to get a different, more visual feel for “good” verses “poor.”By giving the audience with a general guideline for the creation of their website- that it has to be for a club or organization, the author supports the organization of the planning process, while at the same time allows the student for individual choice and autonomy in the specifics. This decision of the author will likely enhance the relevance and value of the assignment for the individual student. The author also makes note in the lesson to address the idea of the convenience of using an information form through an online website instead of having to use a paper form. I feel that the audience is likely to make a connection with this as it’s something that most all have experience doing in their own lives.The teacher also chooses to make use of collaboration and communication in this lesson by allowing students to present their site to the class, as well as send it for evaluation to their teacher and classmates through email. Because the students will be assessing each other’s work, rating the ease of use of their sites, they will be given very realistic and thus mastery-oriented feedback. Overall, this lesson is one that is designed to be of great value to the audience- and it is one that has potential to allow students to meet personal expectations they may have set in the web-design course that they are taking.  ",5

4333,"This lab uses buggy cars and simple measuring techniques of using a ruler and stopwatch for students to collect data. There is an inquiry based element to this lab in that students decide with their group what type of data to collect an how to collect the data.The lesson is valuable because the focus is on students analyzing the data they collect. This analysis will lead to a deeper understanding of motion (including velocity) and will help with students to practice critical thinking. In addition the use of excel will help students become familar with using technology as a data-analysis tool.Further, the lesson could be engaging for a diverse group of students as their are elements of socialization, kinesthetic learning, and visual learning. Group work will help to scaffold understanding for students of various skill levels.Technical Remarks:The link to the pdf was functional and worked well.",4

Since I am a PC user, I'd like to see a similar presentation for those users, maybe students could even compare them.This should recieve high marks for ease of use. All students need to do is forward and backward. I was a bit confused about the speaker for sound bites, I didn't know that played by themselves (which I really like) I'd think about hiding the icon, but the sound will still play.  This sound, text and pictures make things very easy for students to see and understand. They can see things that are familiar to them and even vocab words of things they may have not known the names to.Technical Remarks:There are no external links, all forward, backward and home buttons worked properly.",4

4339,"The iPad stair did a good job incorporating several different instructional stratigies to create a great tool to introduce students to the iPad.  According to Instructional Design Principles, we should make sure that there is a real need to learn the material.  With the iPad stair, the content students are learning is necessary for them to successfully use the iPad.  Also according to instructional design, we shoudl tell students what we want them to learn, and what the end goal is.  This Stair had a slide at the begining explaining the objectives of the stair.   This stair creation also included some pieces from the universal design for learning principles.  The idea behind the universal design for learning is that we need to break down barriers to help students better succeed.  This stair used a LOT of picutres to help students see the actual buttons, and where they are.  I thought this was a great idea and would really help students to make sence of the iPad.I would make very few changes to this stair creation before using it.  One thing I would add, would be a few examples of what students are going to use the iPads for.  This would fall into giving students a reason to learn the material, and something to look forward to.",4
4340,"New technology and space gadets, i am interested to see how the students respond to this website. Looks like a good one for astronomy or when talking about innovative designs.",4
4341,"This presentation is well designed, informative and easy enough for elementary students to use. The layout is simple and information is broken down into chunks. Students should be able to navigate through this presentation independently.

4341,"I loved the format of this STAIR! I personally think aesthetics are important (students sure notice when things look ""boring""), and I liked how professional your presentation looked. I thought the quiz questions were personable and appropriately used affirmations to help students find the correct answer if they missed it the first time (i.e. smiley faces :) I liked that you also had an outside assignment that asked students to select one video from Jan Brett's website and comment on her writing style. As a HS teacher, I think it's important that students learn how to evaluate writing in hopes that it will also help them develop and refine theirs. Great job!Technical Remarks:Your STAIR opened as a pdf instead of a PP, so I was unable to completely ""interact"" with your presentation, but I did see how it would flow had it been uploaded as a PP. Also, your last slide says ""pass up"" instead of ""pass out.""",5

4343,I like how you explain everything. The only thing I really noticed was that all the answers were the same before half time and were the opposite answer after the half time.  Students migth figure that out and stop reading.  You might want to mix up a few of the slides.  Technical Remarks:Try to embed the videos.  It migth save time from them needing to load or students getting distracted on youtube.  ,4
4343,"An excellent introduction to reading Shakespeare; as someone who always ended up watching the BBC plays from the 60's (I'd still recommend it though) instead of just reading through the dense, Shakesperian texts, I wish I'd had this in school. This Kiosk does a great job of gently walking the student through the skills it takes to read and (more importnantly) understanding The Bard. A particularly helpful part of this PowerPoint is that Mr. Poage helps the reader stay appraised of how far along they are. Much like reading Hamlet in one sitting, PowerPoints with no sense of length can seem interminable, even if they are not, so Kudos for that. One last thing, the conversational tone of this activity is fantastic, giving the impression that one is working with the author.",4

4343,"Leonard, I think you did a great job of creating your StAIR on Julius Caesar. I really liked the resources that you included on how to understand Shakespeare.  You did a good job of giving the learner a good foundation of how to understand the overall story and how to understand the style of writing. I think that the direct instructional strategy is a good one for this type of topic. The design of the presentation is nice and pleasing to the eye. If there is one thing I could point out that would make this StAIR a better educational tool is to not have all of the same answers for each section. I think that if you changed it up and made it more challenging it would make the learner think instead of just choosing an answer.   Thanks,DaleTechnical Remarks:All of the technical links seemed to be working well.",4

4352,"This is great!  I love how it is so easy to follow!  It has great visuals and I like how you can click ahead so a more advanced student can move on faster if necessary.  It uses scaffolding because it starts off with simple instructions then the student is able to try it on their own. If you wanted to add more, you could add directions and websites on how to format it MLA style.  Overall, it is awesome and I think it could be used for other grades than just elementary! Technical Remarks:Uses:Google Presentations",5
4352,"I loved this presentation on how to use Microsoft Word!  Personally, I think it's a great way to teach elementary students the basics to a program they will be using every year from here on out.  It was nice that in the presentation you could stay on a screen for however long you wanted and that you had the option to skip forward to the next slide once you've mastered each step.  Also, the use of color and screen shots was a great idea!  Young kids are generally love things that are visually pleasing so I think the colors will help keep their attention and the screen shots will make it easier for them to see the buttons they are supposed to be using.  Overall I'd say you did a great job creating this presentation, its easy to use, visually pleasing and covers a topic that the students will definitely need in the future!",5

4355,"The general concept and design of this STAIR is useful and easy to follow.  Based on the grade level of the intended STAIR I think it is well worded and organized.  Even students at the high school level struggle with GoogleDrive and presenting the information in a user friendly format is beneficial. The basic concept of this STAIR is similar to the intended purpose of mine.  Inform the students about a resource and present the information in a manner that they can return to if they have any questions.  The use of images and graphics to highlight this information was well selected throughout the STAIR.  It can be easy to overwhelm a project like this with too much information, however you were able to find balance through displaying only the necessary images and including information that was well explained.One thing to consider for an area of improvement thay I also need to improve in my own STAIR is thinking about multiple learners.  In my own STAIR I chose to provide audio for students to listen, and very little textual explanation.  Students learn in many ways and by including more textual information I think will better represent my student population.  The STAIR that you have created contains excellent textual support, but might benefit from having audio support for students that process information differently.Technical Remarks:I noticed that the slideshare tool that you used to present this information had a tab where you could place uploaded documents.  This might be a nice opportunity to share with your students a GooglePresentation that you have completed.  Students could then model their own presentations based on your example.",4
4355,"I think the presentation is very clear both in use and content.  I like the use of images of each step with clear directions and arrows to the relevant points on the screen.  I also like the colorful images along the sides and the general tone you use in your directions.  I would have given it one higher rating except that as is it isn't applicable to other school settings.However, there are a couple of things that are unclear to me in terms of how the students will use/see it because of how it is presented on the blog. First, I wonder if it will automatically transition slides or if students will have control over when it moves ahead?  In the embedded version we have to advance each slide with an external forward button.  If this is not how students will see this, it might help if they could have forward, back, and home buttons on each slide.  If it automatically advances it might be good to also include a pause button for learners who want a little more time on some slides. Second, I also wonder if students will be able to access this simultaneously as they actually go through the process of signing up and creating their accounts and demonstrations?  I assume so, in which case the ability to control the pace on their own will be all the more necessary.  If not, then you may consider breaking this up into two or three different presentations (e.g. signing up for an account; creating and sharing a presentation; building and editing slides) as it is a lot of information to process and retain in one go.  If it is all one presentation and process, with opportunities to pause it and follow along by doing it themselves, it might be good to put a little outline or “roadmap” slide at the beginning to help them preview what they are going to be learning in the slide show.Finally, there are a few minor things which I think could improve this a little more.  It seems rather static to me.  Adding some dynamic slide transitions, some embedded voice, and/or video might make it more vibrant.  It would also support learners who have trouble with text if you were giving the directions orally as well.  Instead of each slide being an annotated screenshot, perhaps if it were a screen cast it would work well?  Or you could embed a screen cast of part of the process, then switch to static slides like you have now which have it all written out and which they can access at their own pace as reinforcement of the demonstration plus scaffolding of what they’ll be doing themselves.  Also there were some things which I think were probably just typos.  On slide 26, “to” is missing from second instruction down the page on the left.  On slide 27, I think it would be better to write either “re-arrange some slides” or “move a slide” in the directions.  As for slide 35, I personally try not to use both also and too in the same sentence.Technical Remarks:I wonder about the pop-up on the last slide. When I got to the last slide, it started a little advertisement for other presentations that blocked out the slide’s text before I had read it.  I am not sure if this is a function of viewing it in Slideshare or not and if it will happen with the student-viewed version or not.  If it does, you may want to find a way to work around it, for example just adding one more slide that says simply “End” or “Finish”.",3
4356,"Nice job incorporating several technologies.  I am sure that students (especially at this young age) love to work on a SMART board.  Encouraging them to become familiar with the keyboard is very important.  Early building of these skills will help them quickly move on to greater skills.  Students will learn a few basics by inductive reasoning from your class talk and demonstration.  I liked how you had students work together with peers at the beginning to practice their skills.  Peer motivation, encouragement and review can help students who might be intimidated by a large class setting.   It was great how students were given individual assessment time to show what they have learned by using deductive reasoning.  Although as a teacher, it may be challenging for you to watch all students complete the assignment using the “shift” key.  This is one challenge I see, being able to watch every student and assess during this time.  This is an important task to learn, but made simple enough for kindergartners to grasp and successfully complete their learning goal and task.Technical Remarks:Learning about the shift key is a very important task, but can be successfully completed by kindergartners after this lesson.",4
4356,"What a great lesson idea!  With today’s generation, this is a perfect skill for the students to learn.  I absolutely love the idea of having an animated duck lead the students through the steps.  This will keep their attention throughout the activity (you have definitely thought about your audience and how to connect with them).  The excitement to use SMART Boards is contagious, so using this technology tool will engage the students.  I like the idea that you can record your voice for this activity.  You do not have to keep repeating the directions for each small group of students that come to your center.  You can simply play the directions for them…less time spent on prep work for you.  The task of creating 2 capital letters within a sentence is challenging yet the students will rise to the occasion because of the opportunity to work with the SMART Board.  Having the students work with a partner during this activity is a great idea.  They can help each other when need.  With the teacher being at the center as well, she can scaffold when necessary.  This lesson accommodates the learning styles of many different learners, as you have hands-on learning, visuals, text and voice to help the students understand and achieve the objective.  This lesson incorporates inductive learning, as the teacher is showing the students how to accomplish a task, and then the students are to test their understanding by following the steps that were provided.Technical Remarks:I am wondering how much practice have you given the students with using the shift key before you have this assessment?  Great lesson and easy to follow.",4
4357,This would be good for developing critical thinking skills.,4
4358,"I really appreciate the thoroughness of your lesson plan explanation and the objectives. One objective could have been a little shorter though.

4359,"The Ice Melting Investigation Project lesson plan by Teresa Madyun is an assignment for 9th and 10th grade algebra students designed to help them discover how linear relationships apply to the real world. Real world skills of observing and recording data and making predictions based on that data are practiced when carrying out the performance tasks. Because of the hands-on nature of the assignment, this lesson plan is well-suited to the kinesthetic learner. In addition, Marzano’s instructional strategy of recognizing similarities and differences is practiced when students chart and compare the results between two melting spheres. This would be a very engaging lesson for students and simulates what scientists do in real life. The lesson plan could be improved by providing a more detailed step-by-step description of the method educators need to follow to carry out this lesson. It would be helpful also if the Merlot page contained an image and description to represent the material. Multimedia use is also incorporated in the lesson. Students enter their data into a spreadsheet, represent it graphically, and then report their findings in a PowerPoint presentation.",4
4359,"This appears to be a fun and engaging assignment that addresses several learning styles. I might try this one day. There are a variety of instructional strategies that should motivate most students to be engaged in the project. It helps correlate math content with the goals of the scientific method. The integration of a variety of technologies is appropriate and motivating. Although UDL principles are not directly stated, the Power Point could address some of them. Working in groups can also benefit those within the group that encounter barriers to understanding. I am curious to the size of the two spheres and how long this project takes. There is a disconnect between the audience stated in the lesson plan and the audience on the MERLOT page. In addition, the MERLOT page has no description of the lesson or searchable keywords.",4
4360,"This is a very good lesson. I like how it involves having the students persuade a group of people about a topic. Building on the previous knowledge in class is a positive way to use scaffolding. Group work is always great for collaboration, get the students talking and working together, not by themselves all the time. In my experience, these can be powerful assignments.Technical Remarks:My suggestions would be to involve the audience somehow. Split them up into different focus groups repesented at the meeting and have them ask questions to the presenters to make it even more ""real world"". I would also recommend a rubric for the presentation.",4
4360,"This assignment allows students to use their knowledge and apply it to a real-world situation. Persuading someone else to believe your findings is an excellent way to know if they students truly understand and grasp the material taught. Allowing students to collaborate also allows students to teach one another. I like how the lesson allows students to choose the presentation method. This lesson seems to fit many different learning styles between the previous knowledge learned, the group work and the presentation format.  There is really something for everyone.Technical Remarks:In my experience with group work, both as a teacher and student, there is usually one or two students that do most of the work and the other team members ride the shirttails of the others. In order to document participation of the project, your students could use Google Docs or Zoho Docs. Both of these programs offer tracking changes to check to see how often and how much each team member contributed.  These programs also offer as easy place to create a group document and share the material once it is finished.",4
4360,"This is a cool lesson plan because it involves students making a case for something by using research and evidence.  The lesson is also good because it give students choices on how they wish to present their understanding.  Also, students get to collaborate with other students on the project.  Technical Remarks:One suggestion to further guide the students technologically would be to make the assignment a WebQuest.  That way students would be more guided in their search for information on the internet and they could have access to other materials in the WebQuest. ",4
4361,"This appears to be a potentially beneficial lesson. However, in the need section, the definition of ES worker should be defined for those who are unfamiliar with abbreviations.

Another suggestion is to remove the guideline directions to prevent any possible confusion and ease the reading process.",4
4362,"This lesson had both a meaningful and very relative purpose. The objective to educate on adequate systems for different types of people is a great motivator. This lesson is very open as teaching methods could vary from in class to online. I think it is a very flexible yet structured lesson with great technology integration in online environments like Moodle or Glogster.Technical Remarks:The lesson will address many aspects of computer systems, this is wonderful as it would really educate a learner how a system works, both from the hardware to communicating with the software, and applying purpose depending on the user’s objectives.",4
4362,"Being a Technology Support Specialist myself, I like the fact that the lesson is a specific goal oriented and that it involves strategies that are student-led.  The technology used in the plan covers a fairly wide range of tools from web based discussion forum, to hands-on  tangible activities on hardware.

4363,"I think the concept is really good.  I wish I had the links to these videos you use!  This is such a hard concept to visualize (convection causing plate movement), that I think videos and a discussion on these videos is a great idea.  I think this would help get kids interested in something that is often difficult to motivate kids to understand. I would be interested in seeing your results.  If you have had a positive experience doing this I would bump the rating up. :)I am very interested in how this turns out for you.  Anything that incorporates different ways of approaching a topic I am interested in trying.Technical Remarks:Are these videos mentioned on YouTube?Also, did you try doing a blog about the videos?  I would be interested in how all the technology came together for you.",4

4365,"This lesson plan is meant to help students discover different options for themselves after completing high school.  This lesson plan has several objectives laid out that require students to recall information, perform research, and apply their knowledge.  The author identifies an objective as “identifying examples of concepts” as “Teacher will present information and resources about how to get into college, vocational school, or enter the workforce.”  However, this is not a learning objective for the students and rather presents one of the instructional techniques that will be utilized in the lesson.  Therefore, it should not be included as an instructional objective.    It is also not clear what exactly will be assessed to determine whether students have met the objective.  It would be useful if the lesson were more clear in what assignments the students will be completing (are they writing a paper about how preparing for the future is important?  How do you know that they have researched post-secondary options?)    In terms of apply UDL principles, it is not clear whether there are multiple means of representation.  Part of the difficult in assessing this is a lack of detailed information about what students will be interacting with online.   Furthermore, this lesson plan isn’t for a specific lesson but rather a framework for a whole course.  Since it is a framework for a whole course, the lesson plan length limits how useful the information could be for other users to utilize in their own teaching.Technical Remarks:There are no links to the resources being used nor are there descriptions about their uses.  It would be helpful to know what exactly eCollege is for users who may be unfamiliar with it.",3
4366,"This lesson follows the instructional design format and identifies a problem, real-world performance, instructional objectives, essential content, a method for evaluation and learning, motivation, and socialization that will occur during the lesson.  The lesson details five objectives broken down into three categories:  performing skills, recalling facts, and applying principles.  The evaluation ties together all three types of objectives.Students have the opportunity to experience the story and social issue in different ways through the book, WebQuest, and conclusively through their presentation.  The task also helps students connect themes (in this case social issues) to life outside of the classroom supporting the relevance of the activity.Framing the presentation as a persuasive piece prompts students to consider potential feedback on the identified social issue in order to address both concerns and quesitons.  One thing that remained unclear to me from the plan was what students were trying to convince others of with their presentation.  However, the idea lends possibility to helping students identify multiple perspectives and viewpoints to analyze researched information and present one. Presenting the projects to groups provides a unique opportunity for peer feedback and discussion.",4
4366,I like the concept.  Some students have difficulty with theme and this seems like a wonderful way to help them understand.  I like the fact that they will be creating a presentation which will allow them to have ownership.  Did you create a webquest? Or is it up to the individual teacher? This is a very technology-rich lesson and offers students to use various types of technology for various purposes.,4
4367,Short but very interesting! ,3
4368,The need in the 21st century to help students navigate through the appropriate web references is significant. I think the fake websites are very creative and engaging to the students.      I think the acronym is also very helpful strategy to utilize.One area that might be helpful is to allow the students to devise their own acronym for evaluating a website. It could also be a visual representation of the key components in evaluating the web. I think allowing the student to come up with a checklist that is unique to them will help retain the criteria for evaluation. ,4
4368,This is a huge need in schools today as far too many students think that anything they get off the internet--google in particular is fact. I think that acronym of CAPOW is amazing to present to students. What an excellent resource that will stick with them for a long time! Technical Remarks:None. ,5
4368,"Hi Kelly -Great job!Finding credible resources online is an extremely valuable skill and it is good to see that you are supporting development of the skill before sending your students to do research.  Teaching your CAPOW strategy is likely to help the students remember the key features of a legitimate resource and since it is a memorable acronym the students will be able to apply it beyond your research assignments, and hopefully beyond 8th grade.  I also agree that using humor is a good for initial motivation.  These are definitely aspects of your lesson that I would strongly recommend to others.Two suggestions: It seems your school blocks some of the collaborative tools that might otherwise be available for students to share their list of credible sources and research material.  This would be a worthwhile conversation with your supervisor and/or technology coordinator, as there are many tools that can be designated for your class use only and would not be open to the public (shared google doc., class wiki).  You will need to demonstrate the value added of using this approach.At the point you have students creating a list of resources, you might want to introduce them to some of the citation “machines,” online so that they give proper credit to the information they find.  For example: http://citationmachine.net/index2.php",4

To learn the material you have to become a little familiar wiith the military language.  There are names for things that are unknown to the civilian world.  The material that is displayed is very accurate but a little delayed in time in order to protect troops home and abroad.  The material is very effective and is a great learing tool for those interested in the military.  Technical Remarks: This site was very well created and organized.  It has many useful links.  I had no problem navigating throughout the site.  If your computer is not up to speed you may encounter some difficulty viewing the video clips.

4373,"This is a fairly comprehensive tool, and I could see the value in it as a review tool, especially.  The resource is colorful, but not distracting and both neat and organized.I don't know that it would work as well as an introduction to the words, as the first quiz comes up before any instruction or background is given.  If the first quiz is intended as a pre-test, it would be nice to add the ability to easily go back to take it again after going through the entire vocabulary lesson.I might also recommend changing up the order of the questions a little bit.  In the second quiz section, there were always two questions in a row with the same word as the answer.  Mixing them up would require more careful thought and consideration, I think.Overall, this resource was very easy to use and follow.  The idea of breaking up GRE vocabulary words into several manageable chunks is a fantastic one, and this resource fits the bill.Technical Remarks:I had a few issues with slides not advancing on the first click.  If they didn't, they advanced when clicked again.  This seemed to happen in the Root Review.",4

4381,"The lesson plan was very easy to follow. As a teacher, it was clear what was expected in the lesson. From a technological perspective, there is a good use of technology used that enhances the lesson. I believe this provides motivation for students to learn and complete the assignment and allows the students to complete the objective of the lesson effectively. I especially like the voice thread because students love hearing their own voices and it is used very effectively in this lesson.From a pedagogical perspective, I believe this lesson satisfies many learning types. This lesson allows students to show their understanding of the content they read both visually and audibly. This lesson also provides for collaboration because students are able to share their knowledge with each other using their digital storyboards to create one finished project.  Also, by having the students bring their stories together holds all the students accountable for completing the activity because of the fear of letting down their peers. This lesson also provides for differentiated instruction. Especially for students who have trouble with reading comprehension or fluency, the voice thread allows these students to overcome this learning barrier. My suggestion from this perspective is the need for more accommodations. This lesson seems like it caters toward higher level thinkers. Being a 6th grade teacher, I know that some of my lower achieving students would have trouble completing a lesson like this. Therefore, I would provide more support like possibly making this activity a partner activity to provide for more collaboration or support from peers, or for the teacher to show an example of what a good storyboard summary looks like for reference.Finally, from a content perspective, there is a clear objective, assessment, and motivation to guide students in this lesson. I especially like the incorporation of the skit; it was a great anticipatory set for the lesson. Additionally, this lesson gives students a variety of tasks to cater toward many different strengths a learner might have.Technical Remarks:No revisions I feel are needed. Some reference support would be helpful to include for teachers who are not familiar with the technology provided in the lesson including voicethreads and digital storyboards.",5
4381,"It is obvious that this lesson is well thought out.  First, the lesson is easy to follow, and provides clear directions and details for the teacher. The lesson has clear objectives, an assessment to show the students’ understanding, and relatability between the students and their work.  This lesson is also clear and easy to understand for the students since they already know how to use the technology, write summaries, and use digital recorders.Next, the lesson incorporates technology students are familiar with to create a class project that they can relate to.  The use of VoiceThread and digital recorders allow students to have a stronger connection to their work while they are learning the intended information. This aligns with three of the NETs for students (numbers 1, 2, and 5).  Adding in the skit as a preparatory element further adds in technology that does not take away from the intended learning outcome. It enhances the lesson by providing an alternative to teacher lecture.Pedagogical speaking, this lesson incorporates aspects of all three major learning styles: visual, auditory, and haptic (kinesthetic).  Visual learners benefit from illustrations and presentations that use color and are attracted to written or spoken language rich in imagery. This lesson fulfils that need. Auditory learners’ needs are met because they acquire knowledge by reading aloud. Having students record themselves reading their summaries provides this for the auditory learners. Haptic learners learn best through illustrating their knowledge. Having the students illustrate their chapter summery provides the needed tactile environment for these types of learners. In addition to meeting the needs of the different types of learners, this lesson also incorporates past knowledge that the students have, and concludes with the full class discussion that analyzes any holes in their understanding and work. Technical Remarks:I would like to make a suggestion of having students work in pairs to write two summeries. This would allow the students that do not feel comfortable showing their illustrations or poor writting in front of the class. If students work in pairs, this woould eliminate any feelings of inadaquacy.",5
4382,"I am a fan of Bill Moyer's and I read with interest his take on accessibility to the Internet. Once again he affirms that the real difference is not between the haves and the have nots because here in America we all (almost all) have access to broadband or DSL.  The enthusiasm level here is less than in the rest of the industrial world, therefore we have an international divide: less American users of the Internet per capita.  The site also has a message board for disabled and older people to share their experiences, and for the most part they thank the Internet for improving their life quality by keeping them attuned and in contact with the outside world.",4

4383,"This project is packed with an immense amount of information. This can be a lot for a student to read by themselves. I would suggest adding an audio clip to have the slides read to the user. Also I would have a little bit more interaction within the slides, such as a feedback slide when the user clicks on the words. Overall this is a very well thought out project that can apply to several kinds of learners.Technical Remarks:Link to worksheet repeatedly would not come up.",4

4393,"What a great lesson! I agree that the SMART Board is such an amazing tool to have, and we are so fortunate to have them in our classrooms to enhance student learning. I think it was smart to go back and add review on the operation symbols to refresh students’ memories. Using number stories that are applicable to real-word experiences (e.g. bake sale) is an authentic way for students to learn and practice writing number sentences. You did a nice job of incorporating a variety of teaching methods. Students will love interacting with the SMART Board during whole-group instruction, and will benefit from working with peers. Peer work can be successful because they can learn from one another, support and challenge each other. Applying what they learned to creating their own number story and sentence will be use the math skill being learned. I think this lesson supports all learners, by providing visuals and hands-on experiences.Technical Remarks:To better support all learners, you could allow students who struggle with adding and subtracting to use manipulatives. Also, to better assess each student individually, you could have them complete number stories or create another one independently. This could also be considered a challenge. Overall this is a great lesson, and will definitely use with my small group of kindergartners!",4
4393,"Nice job explaining the background and need for this activity.  Students definitely need to know how to work with number sentences and create their own number story.  This is vital in the real world- and you did a good job of helping students understand and activate prior knowledge and experiences.  You gave the students several chances to communicate and collaborate with peers.  They could ask for assistance, as well as work together to create a product.  Students with lesser skills could be helped by peers with greater knowledge and skills.   Students had several learning strategies to follow.  They were given inductive reasoning to help solve a problem as a class, they were given chances to explore their own problems and create solutions, and students also used deductive reasoning if they needed to help a partner solve a problem.  I enjoyed the way the students were able to choose creative expression in their use of TuxPaint.  Students would be familiar with this program, and had a guideline to follow (create a number sentence and illustrate with pictures) but were given ability to be creative in how they expressed their answer.  Students would be able to draw a picture or create illustrations to match the problem in their mind.  Great wrap up to the lesson as well, students were able to share their creations with their peers and learn from others.  Students will also enjoy the whole class assignment once the teacher has created the slideshow with all the numerical equations pictures.",4

4397,"I am always looking for more materials to share with faculty and staff on designing with accessibility in mind.  The parts I found particularly useful were the printable guides and the FAQ section which was very information without overwhelming the reader. However, I do not see myself sharing the entire material.
The navigation was initially a barrier for me. There are two links with the same text for each resource. There is no title text for the links explaining the differences, only a visual difference. In order to identify what the eyeglass and down arrow icons meant, I had to click on the links. While it may be intuitive for some that the down arrow means printable materials, it can cause confusion and frustration for other users. I appreciated having both options available, and a sentence or key above the links would be very helpful!
The other reason is because the MS Suite directions are specific for Windows users and a specific version of MS Word. It's important to note in these guides that not all versions of the MS Suite fully support accessibility, and that the steps may be slightly different for Mac users. I imagine their institution only uses one version of the suite so they don't need to identify the differences, but it does limit the audience. Our population primarily uses Apple products but we support both and this is something I look for in materials.",3

Great points of your work are the followings:* You have recorded voice for right and wrong choices* You have chosen great pictures* You have got a great explanation of the tests* You have applied the UDL principle in generalThings you can improve* Put it into kiosk mood, so that there is no confusion when students proceed by clicking on the slides or on the action button the result is very different and they tend to miss slides* reorganize the order of your presents so that quiz and knowledge match better Overall you did a great job, thanks! Siming Hu",4
4399,"I really enjoyed this topic that you chose for your StAIR. I like how you started it out with a question, making us guess which picture was the moon cake. It was also neat learning about the legends of why moon cakes are eaten. They look really delicious and I would love to try one some day :)I think you did a very nice job providing options for comprehension for the content in your project.  You provided the background knowledge about where moon cakes came from; which is essentially the legends about why they are eaten in China.  And also, the critical features were highlighted in your presentation; in my opinion this was what they are (made of) and when they are eaten.I have a couple suggestions that I think would make the ease of use better for this StAIR. First, it was a little confusing at first when I got a question to the quiz correct but then I was told to go back to the previous screen. I did realize that I had to go back to the next screen simply to move on, but it might have been nice if I could have moved on right from the slide that told me I was correct, instead of going back. Second, for the last question of the presentation, I got it right and was told to go back, but from there I wasn’t able to go anywhere else. I noticed on your PowerPoint when it wasn’t in presentation mode that after this question there was a “The End” slide, but I wasn’t able to make it there when viewing your presentation. If there had been a button on the slide that told me I answered the question correctly to take me to the next slide, I might have been able to make it to that last slide that send “The End” easier.I can tell that you put a lot of effort into your StAIR, nice job!!",4
4400,"This could be a great resource for students. The ground work and goals of the lesson are excellent.  The overall set up of the lesson is excellent as it asks students to recall information and uses a variety of activities to accomplish this. However, the lesson plan does not have the story that students are supposed to read or the clip students watch. I think that the variety of activities will help all students learn and find success in the lesson. The lesson is technology rich and could be very enjoyable for students.Technical Remarks:A wide variety of technology is used but not accessible to people reading the lesson..",4

4403,"Overall, this STAIR is extremely informative. It provides a very good understanding of the necessary requirements for receiving a work permit following graduation. It is presented in a way that makes logical sense and helps the viewer work through a difficult process. There is a great deal of depth and the questions that are asked help the students recall the information that they have learned.At times, this STAIR seemed like it had a lot of content on each individual slide. Information could be spread out throughout the presentation to help students break down important information. Visuals and videos could be used to explain some of the processes (as well as blank versions of the documents). This would be helpful for all different types of learners. Links to outside resources would also be helpful. Finally, more feedback would be nice when a student clicks on an answer. It is nice to know why the answer is right or wrong.Technical Remarks:The presentation works exceptionally well. It is provided in the proper format and does not have any major technical issues. ",4
4404,I thought this lesson was very well designed and organized.  Right aways by looking at this lesson I could see that several UDL principles were incorporated into your lesson.  I really like the fact that students are creating PowerPoints in this lesson as well as getting into screecasting.  Both are great and teach students some very valuable skills.  My primary concern with your lesson is the fact that students have only one path of options to show their understanding of the content.  For example students who might be kinesthetic learners.  A possible option involving an actual live skit that they perform that might be video recorded and where the same content knowledge might be displayed by the student.  I think you lesson has many great layers of activities in it but I would love to see some different options for students to express their understanding of the content.  I would also like to see some more mention of technology assistance for students who may struggle to read.  An example would be adding some type of talk to text so students who struggle with text (PowerPoints) would have some extra assistance.  I spent twenty minutes looking over your lesson and thought it was fantastic.   ,4
4404,"I love that you have differentiated the lesson to allow students who are shy alternative tools to express themselves.

4411,"I think this lesson holds great merit. I am not sure if your students will find great meaning in the connection between parts of a plant and what they eat at the superstore though. Regardless, I think this is an excellent lesson within a lesson, as it is amazing how many basic fruits and vegetables American children (and adults) cannot name. Another strong source of interest for students might be to relate the structure of plants and vegetables to each other and other species. I think you use multiple ways of teaching effectively through direct instruction, questioning, student work on graphs and computers, and then writing and reflecting as a class. In this regard you weave together multiple intelligences and strategies into a very well rounded lesson.",5
4411,"I think ""Parts of a Plant"" is a wonderful lesson.  I love the interactive piece with the Kids’ Zone graphing site. What a great tool for students to use! The site may be confusing to kids and some of the elements are a bit involved. Teachers may need to walk kids through the first time especially if this is for third graders. However, I found myself a bit confused as to what part the students are actually graphing. Are they graphing how much of what  food they eat that is a plant?The amount and variety of technologies (PowerPoint, graphing site) is excellent. I also like the use of pictures from the supermarket! I feel that the variety of instruction will help keep students engaged.Is this a follow up lesson? It seems there is a lot of information being covered for one lesson.",4
4412,"I really liked the incorporation of technology to improve your instruction on sentence structure. Not only are you incorporating School House Rock to grab their attention, the lesson gives students the choice on what type of program to use to apply what they learned. For example, sharing their list of nouns in google docs or wordle will give students the opportunity to use technology they are familiar with and feel comfortable enough to showcase their lists. Differentiating based on students’ individual needs and interests will help each child feel successful. I think these features make the learning interactive and motivating. The incorporation of a variety of technology elements (video, powerpoint, choice of how to publish word list) make the learning experience authentic, and holds students accountable.Technical Remarks:To improve the lesson, I would give the students more time on the days where they are generating their own lists and sentences. The plan says the lesson will span over a week for 30 minutes each day. You could either extend the time in the computer lab for the days where students will be generating lists, or extend the lesson to 1 ½ to 2 weeks. I think providing students with more time to look for clipart and really put time into showcasing their work will add meaning to the activity.",4
4412,"This is a strong lesson plan for teaching parts of a sentence.  You have really thought through how to properly and thoroughly teach this topic.  Great resources to connect with the students:  SchoolHouse Rock Video is perfect for this age group!  I loved that you thought to include a variety of different technology tools that will allow students to express their understanding of the concept:  Google Docs, Wordle, clipart, Voicethread and/or Audacity. Using the game of charades to teach verbs is a great idea!  Again, this is another way to touch children that learn differently than just through a textbook.  This is definitely a fun activity that they will remember.  It will help them to make the connection between a verb and its meaning (just say…think about charades)!  Having the students work with a partner to generate the list of nouns and verbs is another strength of the lesson.  It not only allows for a greater understanding of the concept, but also helps the students to practice their social skills (extremely important in the first grade).   You have given the students many opportunities to learn about nouns and verbs.  Your final assessment comes at a proper time.  I like that you have the students working independently on creating their sentences.  It will truly show you their understanding of the material.  This activity uses deductive teaching.  The instructor presents the general concepts of noun and verbs to the students, and then the students are given opportunities to practice with instructor feedback, activity and games!Technical Remarks:I would like to see what the jingles were…Also, it is amazing that the students have the opportunity to express themselves with technology; however I just wondering how your students learned all of those tools and how to use them independently…seems like it would take a lot of time.  Would you have a classroom volunteer or parent help with this?",4
4413,"As a high school science teacher, I love the idea of being able to have students ""review"" the grammar that is so lost today with the ""text speak"" the students use. The show was colorful, neat, and easy to follow what was being taught. All explanations were good. I only question if the ""is"" in some of the verb examples should also have been highlighted, as they are helping verbs. I know you address those later in the ""relationships,"" (and again, I am science, not English), but I thought ""biking"" is not a verb, but ""Is biking"" would be a verb. Maybe this is something that can be cleared up with more explanation. I liked the different types of quizzes presented, some were to chose the word out of one sentence, some were to chose the correctly written sentence. It was a nice length and covered a lot of material in a short time, with great examples.Great start!Technical Remarks:The show opened up as a PPT instead of a self running show, I don't know if that is how is was supposed to be. Once I started the show to go through the stAIR, I could not get it to work properly. If I clicked on the arrow to proceed to the next page, I would all of a sudden get the next slide, but it would be h alf ""done"" already. For example, when the slide comes on and i click to hear the words, I am told to click on the noun in the sentence and a box will appear around it. I was not able to click on the word, because by the time I read and clicked the word, the box had already been placed on the word. When I went in to turn the timer off, I then could not get the box to appear when I clicked on the word. Maybe having the sound start automatically when the slide opens will help the timing on that. If I just let the show run on its own, and forward to the next slide without clicking on anything, I would see each slide even the ""Right"" AND ""Wrong"" slide after each quiz question.",3
4413,"This design has many good points. I generalize as below:1. UDL   This lesson design uses many different multiple means of representation.   a provide options for perceptio.     I find alternatives for auditory information, which is to embed teacher's explanation inside.   b. provide options for comprehension     I find in this ppt th highlight of ciritcal features, big ideas and relationships.2. Instructional Strategies  I find Kristin uses at least 3 different strategies:   a. explain: she explains the nouns or verbs in pictures, colors, sounds and sentences.   b. contrast: she makes a clear contrast between nouns and verbs by using the same sentences.   c. relate: she always relates the quiz  answer to the definition and explanation of verbs/ nouns.3. Prodcut desgin Her design is neat and organized, with clear direction and there is no broken link in this ppt.Technical Remarks:Generally speaking, it is clear and easy to understand how to go to next slide.

4414,"I think you did a good job on your StAIR. It was very simple and easy to understand. On one of the slide, the link was not working: I was not able to open the rubric. Also, I was confused about Quiz 3 on the slide “Tips for writing the Body Paragraph” because it said retake Quiz 3. Maybe you meant to retake Quiz #1. To meet UDL Principles, you could add text-to-speech option since there is so much text in your slides. For your quizzes I would have given students different paragraphs to test their knowledge on other than the ones you provided as samples in your StAIR. I liked that you have clear instruction in all of your slides. I think you met instructional design and instructional strategies really well.",4
4414,"Very nice and informative! Great use of different audio and sounds for slides! I liked that you provided examples of each section of an essay. That will really help students understand how to write an effective essay. Great explanations of what each section should include and definitions of words, such as thesis. The links you provided were great as well! They will really help students understand an essay. Providing the checklist was a great way for the students to review and see if they have included everything in their essay. One thing I noticed was that you link the writing rubric and final quiz twice. It can be found in the Writers Checklist section and the GED Writing Rubric. I would choose one place or another to have them, otherwise the student has to go through it twice. It was also a little confusing on your “Tips for Writing the Body Paragraph” slide. You have a “retake quiz #3 button” and when I first came to this slide, I didn’t understand why it was there. I thought I had missed the quiz. I would copy this slide and make it only link from the quiz so it won’t confuse students. I would also consider adding audio buttons on the slides with a lot of text, such as any slide where you have examples of writing. I think you did a good job meeting instructional design, instructional strategy of deductive reasoning, and UDL principles. Overall it was very informative!

In English, it's so important to give a context for the novel we are starting and I like the idea of having a Humanities class where the ideas sync together. I really liked this lesson plan, especially because it's right around the election. Students at my school would definitely have benefited from learning about the different political parties and how they work. I felt it was a great idea to have students collaborate on Google Docs, so they are able to access their work from anywhere. I also enjoyed the timeline idea because it allows kids to see the information in print form and also visually. I think it was a great addition to have them present. It made them accountable for their research and presentation. It also allowed other groups to learn about each party. The lesson plan seems like a very relevant, content-specific, accessible lesson for students to embrace.Technical Remarks:I did not find any technical issues with the lesson plan.

I really thought the added learning material at the end was nice as well incase their still wanted to learn more or if they were ready to move on. Nice job! (I learned stuff myself J)",5
4426,"Birgitte, I like you how integrated our suggestions in questions 1 and 3 in the snapshot.  The intro is much more engaging and spells out the lesson very clearly.  The section on student results is a much better accounting of how the students experience this lesson, too.  I would have liked to have seen more about ""why you think this particular method worked so well for you.""  This still feels a bit like a lesson plan here.  

In the resource page, you did a nice job of elaborating in both the impact and recommendation sections.  Just the simple recommendation of incorporating ""uncommon"" building materials will help your audience in Merlot...

Nice job!",4
4427,"This goal-directed instructional design plan aimed at improving presentation skills for 5th grade students is well done.  It incorporates technology in a way that enhances learning.  The key to this lesson was the pedagogy employed by the teacher that was focused on inquiry. First, the teacher wisely provided links to several potential explorations that students would explore.  By providing the sites, it helps to narrow the focus for the 5th grade students, and it also provided engaging topics that would help students ultimately to produce more engaging presentations.  Throughout, the lesson, students are asked to explore their process.  Questions such as what makes for an excellent presentation, and how images impact on creating a great presentation are addressed.  There is even mention of students recording their process by using Titanpad.  Students benefited from working collaboratively to help develop their own final product, and process is emphasized throughout.While this lesson is outstanding as it is, I would offer the caution that students develop a comfort level with the technology prior to delving into a lesson that ends with presentations geared for a parent audience.  Additionally, I would elaborate on the checkpoints that you are looking for in the process journal that students were asked to create.Fantastic lesson that a libraian created that could be used with any subject area to enhance presenation skills.Technical Remarks:The PDF opened fine and no attachments were associated with it.  I may consider expanding on the presentation tools available to the learners to present their final presentations.",4
4427,"This is a great lesson plan and well appropiate for the age level to learn such skills. I agree with the fact that most students do lack presentation skills and often times they get up there and all they do is present their powerpoint word by word and without context. They lack motivation and have a tremendous fear to face their peers while presenting. I believe this lesson plan helps the student prepare themselves better for the presentation. One is by providing guidance in researching about the topic in order to be more informed. It is a great strategy to provide ""selected teacher gathered links to start the research process"". Second, I also find it helpful that students will be working in groups of threes or fours in order to provide support for one another while doing the research work. Collaborative work will do wonders, but then the lesson plan becomes even better because each student is then able to work on a final individual presentation. As we have learned this will difinitely be more meaningful for the learner. Third, interpreting visuals is another great strategy. Like the saying goes ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". If the student is able to provide meanigful visuals for their audience, then will have a greater impact on them recalling the information. Although, this is a great lesson plan, I have a couple of suggestions. First, I see that there will be enough teacher to student and peer to peer support. However, by following the UDL Guidelines, it would be more beneficial for students to work with a rubric or checklist while they go through the research process or while making the actual powerpoint or keynote presentation. I believe this will help the student create an even better presentation. Second, are Powerpoint and Keynote the only two choices to use as presentation tools? I will suggest two more which I have use online and provide the same results as the others if not better; they are Prezi and Google Docs. In my opinion students should have more choices to use as presentation tools in order to help them achieve more individuality. Overall, this is a great lesson plan and I truly believe your students will benefit from it an acquire skills they can use for the rest of their lives.Technical Remarks:Item is a PDf file and there were no problems associated with it. There were no links or any other technical materials within it.",4

4429,"This is a very interesting article on probiotics, and the importance of a healthy flora. All humans are currently going through a process of microevolution where our natural flora (bacterium population)is mutating into a weaker verison of what they used to be.  Since the time that we invented fire and used it too cook our food over 200,000 years ago the diversity of bacterium in our GI tract has become ""domesticated"".",4
4430,"Nice clean looking site for learning assembly instructions.  Site also provides in the flow of learning a chance for the viewer to ""fill in blanks"" to try to apply the learning",4
4430,I reviewed various sections of the tutorial and I found them to be informative and engaging.  The author provided a question at the end of each section to reinforce the material.It can be used in the classroom to provide the student's an introductiont to the material and then additional discussion can take place during class.,4
4431,"The use of theoretical and applied quiz questions is really nice as this helps the student think critically about the topic.  The use of the assembly line video really enhances the understanding of the complexity of the sequence, loop and decision elements in robots.  The instructions are very clear and the information provided was complex, interesting and applicable to the intended audience. Technical Remarks:The module is easy to use.  The videos, flow charts, pictures, voice recordings and the like provide a good mixed media experience that keeps the audience engaged.",5
4432,"Ruth - You did a nice job of integrating our comments into this final version.  In particular, I like how you re-wrote section one of the snapshot to focus more on the food specific lesson, and how you elaborated a bit on how your students motivation was increased by the food.  Nice job!",4
4433,"Good idea, but the applet worked rather clumsily.",2
4434,Great Job! I like how you narrated and explained everything.  I wish my admins did this more often.  Technical Remarks:Some of your links were different colors so that clued me into the correct answers.  ,4

4437,"This resource is clear and easy to navigate through. Being able to use and understand the quadratic formula is also an essential aspect of the Algebra 1 curriculum. In terms of the UDL principles, the content was represented using the author's ""voice"" and the embedded video. To make this StAIR even more effective, graphing the quadratic function with an emphasis on how the a, b, and c is connected to the function, and/or what the solution of the quadratic formula means, can add a different way of representing, expressing, and engaging students. Similarly, adding a real life connection will also enhance the level of motivation, engagement, and involvement of students. Another suggestion is to add some form of ""timing"" restrictions to each of the navigational button in order to enfore students to complete all the ""work"" on a slide before moving on to the next. Overall, this resource can be used as a learning as well as a reinforcement tool.Technical Remarks:One broken link.",3
4437,"StrengthsThe presentation was designed will to provide information and check for understanding.

4438,"This lesson plan was extremely well written and easy to follow through. Some ways that were used to represent the concepts and to engage students included the use of the Geogebra program and the real-life application aspects. The lesson also provided various means for students to express and apply their understandngs. A thought might be to include some form of collaborative learning for students who learn well when they express themselves verbally. Overall, it is a thorough and well-designed plan.Technical Remarks:No problems.",4
4438,"This lesson plan appears to be well designed. The students recieve an explanation and context with a chance to practice, recieve feedback and apply what they ahve learned to a new situation. This plan satisfies the UDL principles by displayin the information visually, with audio, through practice and through a project.I would suggest a hands on lab. Catapults or just throwing a ball and video taping the trajectory. What state standards does this cover?For socialization, will they be collaborating online or in class? What is to be invluded in their presentation?Did not mention how your power point fits in with this lesson.Overall, this was a solid lesson plan.

4444,"This is a great idea to have students delve deeper into the meaning of a book.  I am certain that books have not sold due to a bad book cover and this lesson helps students consider not only what the book is about, but what to highlight and how to sell the book with it's cover.  I enjoy allowing students to design on the computer as well, it turns working on the computer into more of a design tool and creates novelty for the students as the create a useful item.",4
4444,"This lesson covers many aspects of learning. It has combined language arts with art and technology. I think students would be very engaged while doing the lesson. Not only are they learning about parts of a book, but incorporating the idea of how to make the book more appealing to buy also incorporates economics/marketing to a sort.Technical Remarks:no issues",4
4445,"I think the lesson plan is very interesting and beneficial to high school students. I like that students will be using Internet to research different articles, read, summarize them and then present the material to their classmates. I think it would have been beneficial if you introduced your students to RSS feeds- that way they know that they do not have to search the Internet for news all the time, they can subscribe to different channels and receive the news daily by visiting one site. I liked that a teacher was going to do presentation on a summarized news article as an example. I think you met UDL principles, instructional strategies and instructional design very well.",4
4445,"Great job! You’ve included lots of great information! I like that you’re addressing the idea of having students study international social issues. I also like that you give the students the chance to choose what articles to use for their project. That will help make them feel a part of the learning process. Through the class discussion of each students’ articles/presentations, each student will learn about the different topics from each other. To help improve this age group’s technology skills, maybe you could add a simple presentation software to enhance their oral presentation. This would allow the other learners in the class, who are not auditory learners, to still learn from their fellow classmates. I think you did a good job meeting instructional strategies throughout the less. I also think you did a good job meeting several UDL principles. Overall I think you did a great job and it sounds like a very beneficial lesson!",4
4446,Applet features smooth function and very good graphics.  Lots of functionality as well.,5
4448,"Upon a second visit, the applet appears more versatile.  Recommended.",4
4449,This is a really nice lesson! I liked that you linked the outside material you talked about in the lesson to the actual website. If I were a kid I would be really excited to do this project. My only suggestion is maybe consider doing final writing in Google Docs or a like program. If I am understanding correctly they are working in groups for this so it would make collaboration easier and it might help to overcome common difficulties related to handwriting and spelling.Technical Remarks:Everything works and looks good!,5
4450,Great visuals for the students! I'm want to save this just for something to do in my past time. Thanks!!,5
4451,"    I really enjoyed this resource.  It had a great scaffolding of content. I liked how the students were led along through the concepts and then practiced the concept.  The students were provided with an easy phrase to memorize about rounding ""Five and above give it a shove, four and below leave it alone"".  The student were also given an alternative way of thinking of rhyming by using a numberline.  I thought it was clever to use both as students absorb concepts differently and this addresses multiple learning styles.  I like the feedback given when they answered the questions correctly and incorrectly; it seems very helpful.Technical Remarks:Slide 46 did not coordinate correctly with slide 48.  The sounds did not play automatically when the student got the answer correct, it might be nice if the sound played automatically without having to click on it to hear the clapping.  It might also be nice to be able to go back to previous slides if the student wants to re-read a section, but there aren't any ""back"" buttons.",5
4451,"This is a fantastic resource for teaching rounding! This Stand Alone Instructional Resource teaches a complicated math subject and gently guides the user through rules, examples, and prompts. When a user chooses a wrong answer, there is an applicable prompt that further explains how to apply the rule. It also uses a visual aid that breaks down the rounding concepts into units, which I found to be very helpful. It is very thourough and clearly designed into three parts. There is a helpful rhyme that is used throughout the StAIR that reinforces the material presented. Technical Remarks:3 answer slides need to be edited. And there was a spelling error on slide 61: ""hundreds"" --> ""hundreths""It was easy to navigate, had clear directions, and appropriate interactive buttons. ",5
4452,"I can't really recommend or use the site. It's not in Russian. There should be a ""not applicable""  option. I cannot say that it's a poor site. It  looks well built and organized, however, it has nothing to do with Russian language. At least, I don't see any Russian links.

4453,"This stand-alone presentation uses stark, jarring visuals and humor to present the difficult subject of the scientific method. The author grabs the user’s attention in the beginning of the presentation by posing the need for a solution for the problem of unspent mines. The images the author employs are riveting, yet tasteful in their somewhat gruesome reality of the problem. The subject itself proposes the dire need for a solution. The presentation shows how this is the driving force behind the scientific method; a question or problem and an answer. The presentation uses a classic Monty Python scene do illustrate the process of hypothesis, data, and conclusion. The information is presented in a logical order, mirroring the process it is trying to explain. The open ended questions and answers give the presentation the feel of a Socratic discussion. The links and articles are relevant and informative. The quiz covers the presented material nicely; the Michigan State-University on Michigan theme in the quiz is a nice touch. A few improvements might be to include teaching standards and target audience in the beginning. Also, it may be better to embed the video into the presentation; the advertised videos that accompanied the Holy Grail clip weren’t exactly school appropriate. Overall, this is an entertaining and informative presentation. Technical Remarks:the links at the end are a bit disjointed and the presentation has no clear end.",4
4453,"The author did a wonderful job incorporating humor into the lesson through the use of the Monty Python video clip example in creating this stand-alone instructional resource. The emphasis on creativity in successfully using the scientific process is highlighted throughout the lesson. The use of the landmines example at the beginning will grab the attention of high school students, and promotes critical thinking. Text throughout the presentation is easy to read. I would recommend the author add objectives at the beginning to clearly define expectations for students before they begin the lesson. The variety of examples provided meets a variety of learning styles and helps activate background knowledge. The presentation is very visually appealing and uses appropriate images. I think it would be helpful to add buttons or arrows to provide clear navigation for the learner. It is not always clear how to advance to the next slide or whether or not information is linked to outside sources.  Minimal feedback is provided for both correct and incorrect answer choices, but this may be in part to the open-ended nature of the material being discussed. I think it would be helpful for other educators if the author included the content standards that are addressed in this lesson. Adding a slide with objectives, intended grade level, and a time estimate would be very helpful. Overall, this is a great resource for students to complete independently and learn about the value of the scientific process.  Technical Remarks:Navigation between slides is unclear and no obvious way to move backwards through the presentation. All links for additonal information in the presentation are active and functional.",4
4454,This STAIR was very informative.  The graphics made it engaging and your explanations were very clear and easy to understand.  It might have been helpful to have a back arrow on the pages as well because there were times when I wanted to reread what was on the last page but could only go forwards.  I thought the quiz questions did a good job of giving the learner practice using estar and ser.  Technical Remarks:Sometimes when I got a question wrong and clicked try again it took me back to a previous question instead of the one I got wrong.,4
4455,The author made sure to include plenty of background information to drive the point that dual credit is a great way to keep motivation an exciting factor.   ,4
4456,"The lesson articulates specific instructional objectives which address the identified problem for students to work toward understanding.  The objectives stated are categorized by performing skills, recalling facts, and applying principles.  In addition, specific standards are noted for Clarksville Montgomery County.  The defined objectives and standards are supported by the lesson activity.Objectives and standards are not only provided but situated within a real world context.  The performance task asks students to perform add and subtract decimals in the context of money.  Additionally, the task allows students freedom to choose the types of purchases made which serves to increase motivation and student interest.The lesson provides time for teacher modeling of the activity after students recall the necessary prior knowledge for the task.  Student groups are utilized to help students think about the types of purchases in addition to the modeled example providing students with a couple opportunities to think through the task that will be evaluated.  Students receive feedback from peers before submitting the final assignment for further feedback from the teacher.  This lesson offers students a couple chances to refine their work and explain their thinking to others.",4
4456,I think this is a great lesson for students because it combines real world skills with studying decimal operations. The lesson builds on prior knowledge by allowing students to take what they know about adding and subtracting decimals and apply it to shopping on the Internet. I think it is a great that the lesson combines the online shopping element as well. It helps teach kids early on that real money gets spent online and could be a good Internet safety lesson for them. Great job!,5
4457,"This is a wonderful idea, and a lesson that so many students need to learn.  This lesson is grounded in a real-world and authentic need, which serves to motivate students and keep them engaged.  Using a popular video will also serve to spark their interest.  Do students have a choice on which site they use to explore privacy settings?  How would you account for students who do not have a social networking account of any kind (I imagine this issue would come up less than infrequently, but one never knows).  What about school firewalls that prevent accessing these sites? I would recommend some kind of blogging/sharing/collaborative experience to accompany this activity where students justify why they made the changes that they made to their privacy settings.  Facebook has so many settings and options; there are sure to be a wide variety of settings chosen by students.  By supporting and defending their choices, students would demonstrate understanding of reasons behind changing privacy settings and help their peers understand different choices as well.  ",4

I like how you add the home button in case students wanna refer to the precious knowledge. You have implemented the stAIR design principles so that students can work on this totally by themselves without guidance.However, one problem is I can not open any one of the videoes provided. There maybe a problem with the link or something.Overall, you did a great job! Well done! Siming Hu",5
4464,I really like the background of this powerpoint. It is very nice and cute. The whole PPT is well organized and you can go back to homepage on every page. But I can not open the youtube links you have. Maybe thats because my school network blocked it.,5
4464,"Dear Angela,I enjoyed your StAIR. I think you did a good job giving simple but informational guidance to students. You also embedded videos in your ppt which will help students get a direct view of the problem. I think this shows that you are providing various pedagogies for students who have different learning styles and needs. Also, the quiz that you used are from simple to complex, and you provide encouraging feedbacks. This will help students to get excited about learning!However, I don't know why I cannot see the videos. In my computer the video pages do not show the videos.Thanks for sharing it with me. I have enjoyed it!Technical Remarks:utilization of the video",4
4465,"This is a great resouce for students in about 6th grade who are studying the regions of the United States. This resource could be used for the students who need extra reveiw or for students who miss a class.The standards/benchmarks are clearly outlined at the beginning and the lesson's goals are simply stated so that 6th grade students can understand the purpose of the slideshow before they begin. The slideshow would also appeal to a variety of learning styles because it uses multiple instructional strategies--videos, sound, visual photographs, written information and quizzes/practice. The slideshow especially has a high visual quality. The slides use many colors and photgraphs, and they are alwyas visually attractive. The author of this slideshow also employs a good use of color--the answers to the multiple choice questions change color when they are selected, helping the student use the process of elimination when they are unsure of a question.Technical Remarks:I would recommend embedding the videos into the slideshow so that it does not take viewers to a separate page. After viewing the videos, students might not be able to get back to the slideshow. I would also put a ""home"" button going to the menu on more of the slides to make navegation a bit easier.",4
4465,"This lesson is great! From a pedagogical perspective, it uses both visual and audio components to illustrate key concepts of the western and southern parts of the United States. The vivid pictures provided are an effective way to make sure that all students understand the different elements discussed. Also, the use of videos at the beginning of the presentation grabs the students’ attention, and keeps it by allowing them to choose the route they want to take first, west or south. The integration of quiz questions provided at the end of each section allows students to gain feedback on their understanding. Lastly, the presentation pulls all the information together for a final assessment dealing with both areas of the United States. From a technological perspective, the PowerPoint presentation is an effective way to review the information taught in class, or as a student lead learning activity. The two informational videos supports the information discussed during the rest of the presentation well. Also, I really like that the students could click on a link to find the weather and climate of the regions from the weather channel. This was a neat idea! Lastly, this aligns with the NETs for students (numbers 4&6). From a content perspective, the presentation is an effective way to present the material. The standards and benchmarks are clearly stated, as well as, the goals for the learners. The presentation is written so that all learners can understand the material discussed. The vivid pictures reinforce the content without distracting the student from the learning goals. Lastly, the content is presented in a logical order that is repeated throughout the presentation.Technical Remarks:I would try to embed the videos rather than sending the student to YouTube. This would keep students getting off task.",4

4469,This lesson seems well organized and it seems to adhere well to the UDL principles overall.  It is very easy to see that you used reverse design in creating this lesson and the goals are very clearly stated.  My primary concern is that students don’t have many options or paths to take when it comes to demonstrating their understanding of the content.  I have had any experience with flipcharts myself but would be interested to see if their was a way to incorporate and type of videocast into them for students who struggle with learning and demonstrating understanding with text.  Student who might struggle with reading may struggle with aspects of this assignment.  I would love to seem some technology aides incorporated such as text to talk to help those students who might not be able to handle the reading load that well.  Overall I think your lesson is well organized.  I spent twenty minutes reviewing your lesson and really enjoyed it.,4
4469,"  As Brad mentioned Gitane's statement of the standards upfront was good, and including the instructional objectives....but the common core for LA and ISTE NEts was too much for one powerpoint slide and could be in the appendix for teachers.  That would be one recommendation.  She used a current craigslist and Nation slide for student's examples which are real world examples.Craigslist has been associated with lots of phishing schemes so some lesson on cautions about websites and security may be in order.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the Craigslist Thailand but using craigslist as an example of persuasive writing was excellent.  It is about sales.  The practice slides were beneficial for the distinguishing part and finding the opinions or judgments as clues was good.  Nice visuals in the STAIR...the Happy face for correct answers was uplifting.Technical Remarks:20 minutes was spent reviewing this STAIR.",5
4469,You have a good balance of informational text & pictorial representations. I like how you explored the website with word bubbles. The information was straight to the point and not too wordy. I also liked how you had the information of the two different writing techniques on one slide for students to compare/contrast the information. Your STaIR was engaging & kept my interest until the end. Technical Remarks:I like how you allowed students the option to explore beyond the STaIR.,5
4470,"What great tutorials on edcanvas and slidesnack!  Both are new to me, so I truly appreciate learning about these new tools. I would rate the ease of this at a 9 because you show AND tell how to use both tools.  These are both practical technologies to use in the classroom at a station, or to post on a teacher website for students to use at home.  It would also be nice to use for a presentation.  The only problem I had were the slight pauses which I'm sure just happen due to processing time.   Thanks for the learning! Technical Remarks:Small pauses, but does not effect learning.",5
4470,"Good job, Lacey on your project!  I really enjoyed the layout that let the audience not only choose what tools they wanted to learn about, but also the way they wanted to learn about it as well.  Great if you're in a cafe or someplace and don't want the whole place to hear about how great Edcanvas is.  The only problem I had with the presentation was the screencasts did not automatically work when I viewed the presenation. I did notice that you had the videos in another folder so I could play them if I exited the presenation.",3
4471,"Nice job! Students in kindergarten will definitely relate to this as this is a very important concept/skill to master.  Often is can be tricky just to hear and understand, but giving students a visual with sounds as well as hands-on practice finding the sounds is great.    There is inductive reasoning at the beginning of the sections when students learn what middle and endings sounds are.  Then for the quizzes and practice students used deductive reasoning to be able to show what they have learned.  I like the little dancing penguin; this will keep students attention as they begin to look for him after completing an answer.  I like that you gave positive feedback as well as encouraging words for incorrect answers.  It reassures students that even though they were wrong, they can still accomplish the task.  Great job!Technical Remarks:A few issues I noticed were that I was able to click through the creation without having to wait or use the snowflakes keys or the penguin.  It seemed to not be in kiosk mode where students are unable to click any other buttons.  There were a few slides where two audios would play at the same time.  Your instructions would play as well as the featured word.  This could be confusing as to which words to listen to.  The StAIR also skipped in a few places and brought me back in a loop in one place.",4
4471,"I think title of your StAIR is attention grabbing! What first grader would not want to participate in an activity that has the word “Blast” in it! It is easy to see that you were accommodating the different learning styles of your audience. Having the words typed on the slides is important, but you took it a step further by incorporating your own voice in the activity. This is important for both visual and auditory learners. I loved how you had the snowflakes flash when you were showing the students where to focus for the learning activity. When you were focusing on middle letters, the middle letter of the word on your screen was…yet another important visual learning opportunity. This StAIR has inductive teaching involved as students were taught information and then quizzed on their understanding of the topic. I would maybe add some movement and sound on the “Great Job!” pages. Try using a different snow animal or dancing snowman to keep the attention of the learners. When quizzing the students on the middle sounds, it might make more sense to say “Click on the letter that makes the correct middle sound” instead of saying find the middle sound.Technical Remarks:Take a look at the final assessment. When I click on the different pictures, some of the sounds are not in the word at all. For example, when I click on the picture of a pin, the sound of the letter T is said. The directions also say to circle the M or E. On a presentation like this, you might need to have the students click on the appropriate letter since you can’t circle on the actual screen.",3
4472,"I have not read Hugo Cabret, nor have I ever used the book in my classroom, however I still found this StAIR to be enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the beginning set-up to the activity where the students were 'spoken' to by Hugo.  I found the links to be useful, however I would have liked the students to be given a goal when looking at those sites.  A large site can be overwhelming, especially for a student who is inexperienced with online research.  I enjoyed the pictures of France and feel that using this StAIR would create a greater understanding of the setting of Hugo Cabret.  The additional information about facts and opinions was useful, however, I felt that it could potentially side track the student from the identified objective.  Overall, I felt that this was a good activity that students would find engaging, enjoyable, and informative.Technical Remarks:The links and interactions worked properly.",4
4472,"My role is to rate this StAIR.  I have never used it in my fifth grade classroom.  This project would be useful when reading the book, ""The Inventions of Hugo Cabret"" in order to gain more knowledge on Paris, France, Automata, and Georges Melies.  It was effective to have more links on particular topics where a student could go to get more information or take a virtual tour.  However, I would suggest finding more user-friendly kid links.  It would enhance the presentation  I thought the link to the virtual tour was great, but the Eiffel Tower link could have been changed or deleted.  OVerall, I would recommend this StAIR project.Technical Remarks:There were no technological gliches as I went through the StAIR project.",4
4473,"This resource is well worth the use! The content is well organized, nicely laid out, with interesting additions of images and videos. I like how the content just seems to be unfolded smoothly, providing enough information for the reader, and culminating in multiple-choice questions. Well done!  Technical Remarks:Everything works beautifully. I also enjoyed the selection of colors, which makes the material more pleasant to read. The only suggestion that I have is about the correction of one typo under the first slide of the ""Earthquake"" section. It shows ""vedio"" instead of ""video"".",4
4474,"I think this lesson did a great job of incorporating all different types of multimedia on a very important topic. I agree that the instructions page was a lot of information at first but I think its necessary to have students slow down and go through the entire assignment. There is a lot of value to the pictures, video and audio and it truly has something for all types of learners. The questions are well formed and require students to pay attention in order to answer them correctly.As a Social Studies teacher I love collecting additional resources. This StAIR is a great lesson. Perhaps afterwards students can visit the museum website at http://www.nps.gov/elis/index.htmTechnical Remarks:I do not have power point so I am not sure if the issue I was having with the audio was related to viewing the presentation through Open Office. I was able to navigate easily through the quiz and found it a fun and engaging way to instantly provide a class full of students direct feedback on an assignment. The arrow buttons and home screen icon made it easy to navigate.",5
4474,"This was a very creative way to incorporate an online resource and mini-assessment questions into one lesson. The use of the Scholastic resources really enhanced this social studies unit on Ellis Island. I felt the use of the photos, videos, and audio was a great way to engage the students and take into account the various learning styles of the students.The Standards and Directions slides presented a lot of information for the students to read and process. I think the information is importatnt to include, but might better serve ALL students if the information was divided into several slides.Technical Remarks:The StAIR opened without issues on my computer with powerpoint. Unfortunaltely, I did have an issue with one of the slide hyperlinks. On slide 14, when I clicked on Stop 8 to ""try again"" it took me to the Great Job slide instead of the the Stop 8 for review.",4
4474,"I really enjoyed the tour through Ellis Island.  I found myslef completely entranced with the different stops and the video.  i am sure this would be an excellent resource for any social studies class, what amazing stories!The STAIR resource itself was well formed.  I found the instructions page to be a little daunting and because I tend to speed read, (a bad habit) I had to go back a few times to read the instructions again.  If the students had seen this kind of format before perhaps it would be easier.With all the different resources inthe Scholastic site I believe that the novelty of this lesson would be great with 8th graders.  it would force them to delve deeper into a very releavant topic for US history.Technical Remarks:I actually did not have Powerpoint on the computer I used but it worked well on Open Office.  Because these are 8th graders I think they would have no problem clicking back and forth from the website to the Powerpoint, probably Elementary students would have a hard time with it.   Everything worked well when I clicked on it and the buttons were obvious and well placed to keep the flow going.",4
4475,"This lesson begins with a good tutorial on how to work in blackboard.  It is very nice to see exactly what you need to do, rather than instructions in the form of a list for visual learners.  After this is done, students have to actually click everything they would need to for their tasks in blackboard.  This is great because before they ever get the chance to do it, they have done it.  This lesson appeals to different learning styles because you see it, hear it, and also have to do it.  This method of creating a tutorial could be very useful for anything that needs to be done on a computer and gives practice throughout (This is something I would like to learn after viewing this lesson!).  The quiz at the end of the sections is a good review to make sure that you are ready to try this on your own.  It is also useful that the video jumps to an answer if you get it wrong.",5
4475,"Well done tutorial. I like the way you start by explaining and showing the process you are about to teach.  Next, the steps are very clear and you provide timely stopping points for the learner to go through the process along with the step by step demonstration.  Lastly, you check for understanding by using quizzes.  This tutorial s very straight forward with little distraction to confuse the learner.",5
4476,I thought your StAIR was well done.  Reading the story allowed with the presentation made it easy to follow and took into consideration the fact that not everybody is on the same reading level.Technical Remarks:Have you thought about linking the audio to begin right when you click to slide? This would allow for a smoother transition to each slide and take away from the constant clicking.,4
4477,"Writing this review is difficult because I have no previous knowledge of the Chinese language.  I found this StAIR to be somewhat difficult to follow, as I did not always know what information I was supposed to be taking away from the slide.  For example, on the slide “Sentences and Vocabulary” I felt I was supposed to learn the Chinese equivalent of the sentence but there were no Chinese words of pronunciation examples given.  Also, the Megaphone on this slide did not work for me.In following through the rest of the StAIR I could not seem to get to all of the slides you created.  I watched this StAIR in kiosk mode, but I kept arriving at the end of the presentation without viewing all of your slides.I think that you kept UDL principals in mind when creating this project, as you incorporated various techniques to reach all of your learners.  I feel your audio could be improved because students would benefit from hearing more of your pronunciation.  The applause is uplifting and helps build confidence.  The images you use are very nice and help create a sound visual for your students.Technical Remarks:As stated above, some of the arrows did not take me to the next or previous slide within this presentation.  Also, I could not find audio on all of the Megaphone options.  If I had not exited and re-entered this project a couple of times, I believe I would have completely missed some of the information.",2
4477,"I was able to follow the reasoning behind the stAIR, but it opens as a Powerpoint instead of a running program. I like the topic, how to say useful and common phrases in Chinese. I like the quizzes being multiple choice, they really make you think about the correct answer. I was not able to follow the thought process, though, on the organization of slide. I got to the page with all of the sentences in English on it, and I saw the sound icons. I pressed them, hoping to hear the sentence in Chinese, but all I got was applause and a new slide with the Chinese words on it. I was never able to find out how the words were spoken, how they sounded when said out loud. All I could do is try to sound out the written words ( in English letters) and hope I was saying it right.This type of stAIR would be a great asset to any language program. To be able to access the prononciation and soind of a language at any time is great. I still remember some of the French I learned in High school because of speaking it over and over again.Technical Remarks:Like mentioned above, the sound icons were just applause on the 3rd or 4th slide. The slides did move when the forward button was clicked, though some buttons needed to be clicked in a certain area for them to work. I feel like I missed a lot of information when I went through because the slides jumped ahead without any sounds.",3
4478,"This resource contains clear objectives so that students can check their own learning, and presents information in a variety of ways (clear diagrams, useful explanations, and links to videos) to keep students engaged with the material.  Students are able to naviate backwards during teaching slides, which provides them the opportunity to review at their own pace.  I also liked the specific re-teaching slides that are included during the quiz activities.Technical Remarks:This StAIR is of high-quality and allows students to navigate easily throughout, but there are punctuation typos on a couple of slides.  Overall, the resource is presented in an information-rich, high-interest format.

4486,I really liked this STAIR. I knew nothing about SUPPLY and DEMAND curve shifts prior to examining this STAIR. The lesson takes the learner through a very systematic approach to the content examining all of the material. The quiz really allows opportunities for the learner to demonstarte their learning. The graphics are appropriate and the hyperlinks effective. I learnt something :),4
4486,"This StAIR project uses lecture with student interaction as the main instructional strategy. Students follow along to learn how to use KidBlog. I think this StAIR would be very useful for teaching students about supply and demand curves if students had a brief introduction to the concepts. The StAIR is very interactive with many interesting graphics. It is an engaging tutorial, but since there is not a very detailed description of the supply and demand curve in the StAIR, I think this would be helpful for the teacher to quickly explain before students begin this. The assignment explains what students will learn, and also what they will learn next. This informs the student about how this information will be valuable to them. The examples given are real life examples, which makes the StAIR applicable to students’ lives. The StAIR also gives immediate feedback to the students on whether their answers to specific questions are correct or not. Overall, the StAIR was engaging and appropriately interactive with sounds and images. One suggestion that I would make is to give students more feedback when they get answers to the questions incorrect. There is feedback given for correct answers, which is helpful. Also, I would recommend slowing down some of the animations in the presentation. I could not finish reading all of the automatic word bubbles as they appeared and disappeared. Other than that, this would be a great resource for students.",4

4496,"I really enjoy the topic and goal of your lesson plan. It is very important for students to recognize that they cannot just borrow information or images without citing where they grabbed the material from. I feel as though teachers need to take the time to teach such a lesson so that they can stress the importance to their students.The practice portion of your lesson points out that you had the children look up images that will be relevant at another time. I think that it is so important to give students a valued purpose for each assignment so they see why it has meaning to them and in the future.An additional piece to the meaningfulness of the lesson could be educating students of the effects of using information illegally without citing where it came from.Although students are expected to complete parts of this lesson independently, you leave the door open for classroom collaboration by encouraging them to utilize their peers as needed.Technical Remarks:I could not get the link for creative commons under the practice portion of the lesson to work.

There is immediate formative feedback and students know right away if they are understanding.  There is a lot of reading and answering questions but it is not very interavtice.  Will there be a culminating activity when they are done to use this information? I really enjoyed the text feature of this STAIR.Technical Remarks:All the links and text worked well. ",4

4503,"Wow! This slideshow is very visually appealing and extremely easy to use. I like that there is consistency with the description being presented down the left-side of the page and that I can go forward or backward through the slides. It was a nice touch that you included your own website as an example on one of the slides also. I think that students could easily use this lesson to learn more about design elements. I like that the quiz informed you if you were correct or incorrect. Do the students have to get 100% to ""pass"" the quiz? I missed a couple of questions and had a 40/50 (80%) and it said that I failed so I was just curious. I really don't have any suggestions for improvement except that there were two similar questions on your quiz (in a row) regarding contrast. The actual lesson was informational and easy to use.

Skinner's work is being used on autistic children, today, to articles about activism from the early 60s and ""anti-war and peace"" sites.   I think I will like the e-book for my work with ESLs, or if not this book, the method used.  I just think this work is more about getting a message out than what it is purporting.Technical Remarks:A few of the links, particularly the only one of the list of links that I was really interested in, didn't work.",3

This is very well done and looks really good.",4
4523,"Overall, the activity is very organized, logical and easy to follow with two distinct sections that can be accessed from the home page.   The colors are complimentary and the overall theme is not distracting.     Images are effectively used to provide examples of each term on each slide, but captions for these images might be helpful for some students.  Images are also used as part of an assessment, which is a useful differentiation technique.    Not only are text and visuals used, but video is also embedded to further engage the user.  Perhaps audio recording, which narrates some of the text would be useful as an additional UDL design principle.     The assessments also demonstrate good pedagogy.  For example, before students take the quiz, they have the option to go back and review that section of information.    The StAIR provides feedback for wrong answers in each quiz, but sometimes the feedback either repeats the question or does not guide the student toward the correct answer.   The final assessment is something tangible that can be collected by the teacher to gather data.Technical Remarks:The activity is made with PowerPoint and includes text, visuals, and video media.  Using a Mac with 10.5.8, I had no trouble viewing and accessing all parts of the StAIR.",4
4523,"Overall, the tool is logically sequenced and is easy to use.Graphics are clear.This stAIR project represents the concepts in word, pictures, audio, and video. Learners can click on the video to listen, watch, and learn and then click on choices and alternatives for feedback. The variety of transitions  provide some different types of engagement, yet the  following recommendations are for assistive learning:Label each picture with its caption, rather than listing.Place words in order as the pictures or vice versa for learners whom can’t identify the objects.Reorder the examples in the Human Feature by grouping categories – buildings, roads, transportation, communication, religion, food, industries.Under Question 3 the globes show lines, but a label or one line on the globe in red with an arrows pointing would better illustrate the concept of either longitude or latitude.The numbers and the pointer on the video about the map are illegible. It is recommended to put the pointer in a dark color and larger. The numbers on the map need to be larger as well. When the pointer indicates the lines, this instruction is unclear.

4524,"You had a very informative StAIR about the thirteen colonies!  I noticed that for some of the slides, you not only provided the students with information but also added music in the background to reflect the topic.  For instance, when talking about fishing and shipbuilding, you provided students with background music that sounded like ships.  The noise in addition to the text helped provide a clear visual for students to understand and relate to the information being provided.A suggestion that I might add to your StAIR would be to use animations to present the material in smaller chunks.  There was a lot of information being shared with the students on one slide.  This was okay because it was by topic, but perhaps having the information presented piece by piece would make it feel less overwhelming for a struggling student, particularly students who might struggle in reading.  Having the focused entrance of sets of information, rather than an entire slide full, would be a way of differentiating for students.Another way to spice up the UDL of your StAIR might be to add some varying ways of presenting the information.  Perhaps there are some interesting videos that you could incorporate into the resource or perhaps you could provide links for students to outside resources.  The information you provided was great, just maybe altering how it is presented could help reach all learners (auditory, visual, etc.).  I think it would keep students very engaged.Overall, you had an excellent resource here for students.  The StAIR provided students will all of the necessary main ideas for the colonies.  It was easy to tell that you divided the resource into three sections.  Students could easily “start over” within each section if they didn’t feel that they understood that topic enough.  Good job!Technical Remarks:Some of the animations would grow for the effect.  When this happened, the picture actually started to cover some of the information that was being presented to the students.  It also looked like some of the sound effects might not have been working.  This might have been because of the version of PowerPoint I have.  Other than that, all of the links took you to the desired location.  Good job!",4
4524,"This resource features a great amount information about the thirteen original colonies of the United States of America. The StAIR is broken into three subgroups: northern, middle, and southern colonies. Each of the subgroups features location, terrain, weather, resources, and other notable facts of the area. At the end of each subgroup, two questions are answered. The nice thing about this part of the resource is that if a question is answered incorrectly, the user will be directed back to the part of the lesson where the answer could be found. The only suggestions I have for this resource would be to add back buttons in the lesson, so that users could review before answering the questions. Also, adding an introduction and objectives to the beginning might be helpful for teachers to determine if they can use this resource in their classrooms. Lastly, adding some differentiation in your resource would help all students learn the material. Overall, the navigation, transitions, animations, and sounds were engaging to users and will be a great resource for a history class.Technical Remarks:All buttons worked to navigate through the StAIR.",4
4524,I thought you did a great job putting this STAIR together.  The content was spot on and the questions were appropriate for assessing student learning.  The layout of your slides were great too.  I really liked the theme of thre PPS.  The only suggestion I would make is to spread out the information over a few more slides.  That's a minor point that doesn't detract from the overall effectivness of this STAIR.,5
4525,"Hi Mrs. Khater 
I visited suggested website http://www.timeforkids.com and found it to be very beneficial, and practical, when it comes to teaching learners several issues about life related fact and practices. In the games section, and under Want to save the Earth? Then: . The rule of the game is about situation from our daily life where things are done in a way to hurt the environment and not help it. The players/ learners will get to be familiar with the rules of the game very quick. So the idea of the game is to click on certain sections of a big picture for things every one of us do on regular basis. Things like eating, showering, cooking, preparing box lunches, using our refrigerators and closets. 
Actually it is not played as any other game, yet it could be made into a game with questions and answers designed in the target language to enrich the vocabulary of the learner and help his critical thinking when it comes to problem solving in the foreign language. 
Now on choosing a certain situation from the main picture and clicking on it, a second window will open with suggestions on how to better deal with that selected situation to help the environment and preserve its resources. Like for instance if you were to chose the lunch box image and click on it, the box that will appear will include a note with a HINT on what is the best way to pack your lunch to minimize the amount of the throwaway garbage by packing only reusable containers. Imagine that HINT appearing in Arabic for example when the Arabic basic course student clicks on the picture. There will be couple questions associated with the HINT. Questions like write 20  50 in Arabic, words on how to minimize the everyday garbage amount the students take to school? 
	I think this is yet another appropriate website and a vital resource for any language teacher to tab in and redesign it, so to speak to fit his/ her students learning goals and objectives though it was originally created for children. Good job Mrs Khater, thanks.

Students easily move at their own pace, and when answering a question they can't move forward until they answer it correctly. I really enjoyed the embedded sounds for incorrect answers.Technical Remarks:After downloading, the PowerPoint opens in editing mode, so I would consider saving it so it opens automatically as a presentation. The PowerPoint operates in Kiosk mode and the action buttons work as expected, but I would consider placing back buttons on all slides in case a student chooses to review content from a previous slide. The movie has a .mov extension so PC users may need to download a plug-in to use it.",4
4527,"This powerpoint is easy for students to navigate and engages them with images and self-check quizzes. The focus is on introducting transition usage when writing paragraphs and it would be a great opportunity to use this resource to flip the classroom. Students can go home and learn about transitions on through the powerpoint and come to class the next day prepared to demonstrate their new found knowledge.The pedagogical strategy that dominates this lesson direct instruction through the ""rule-example"" approach. Students are exposed to different types of transitions and then presented a few examples of those transitions in use. It seems to be easily accessible to all learners and will allow them to go through the powerpoint at their own pace. This is in line with UDL principles.Technical Remarks:The powerpoint runs in kiosk mode and has a video clip embedded.Perhaps this could be improved upon by having students create a writing sample once they have finished the powerpoint and posting it to a wiki or blog before they come to school the next day. The teacher can then review these posts and gauge where students are at with the material coming into the class. It would add an additional technological component to the lesson and this could allow for some more individualized differentiation/another opportunity for teacher feedback.",4

4532,"1.Spent 1 hour viewing the material.2.Nice content that brings the concepts to you in more graphic detail.3. Very effective, from the text book4.The slides were very easy to use.",4
4532,"This is a slideshow that would be used to supplement a classroom lecture.  By itself, it does not provide value since the slides are not comprehensive.I said that it would not be used in the classroom since it would probably be more work to design a lecture around the slideshow versus a slideshow around an established lecture.",2
4533,"I reviewed this site for about 30 minutes. It gives alot of information, but very little instruction on using it.  Not very good for classroom use.",1

4535,"I was shocked to read this article. I think it really boarderlines ethnic values. If this experiment was to continue, I feel it would get alot of heated debate regarding the issue.",4
4536,"This lesson is great for reinforcing the skill of using a dictionary; which is a skill that many students lack, but definitely need to know. I think the idea of using an ELMO to demonstrate how to look up words is a great way to visually teach a large group of students how to use a dictionary.Technical Remarks:After completing the lesson as it is now, it might be a good idea to also teach them how to use online dictionaries or electronic dictionaries so the can have access to different resources.",4
4537,I think your StAIR will be a nice addition to showing instructors how to create their own grade book. I think with the template it should be an easy process for them without a lot of extra work. Technical Remarks:The only thing I would suggest would be to add some instructional videos of demonstration for added visuals.,5
4537,Ease of use –I think that your StAIR is well organized and easy to use. What you did well –I think that you did a good job of showing visuals to help with what you are explaining. What you could add to make the resource more useful –I think that you did everything very well.Technical Remarks:Technical remarks are that it was well done.,4
4537,"Great StAIR project.  You lesson was really easy to follow and clear for how to set up the grade book.  You make good use of screen captures to show exactly how to set up the grade book.  those visual clues are really helpful from a UDL standpoint.  You cover all the important details for anyone to get started on this process, as well as providing them with templates to help smooth over the transition.  ",5
4538,This is an excellent resource for teaching students about the value of money!  I especially liked the way there is an option to press the speaker button to hear the words read aloud.  I thought the presentation of the information was well-organized and easy to follow.  Lots of practice problems are given to reinforce learning.  The sound effects make the quizzes more exciting.  I would definitely use this resource in my classroom!Technical Remarks:All of the links worked well and were easy to follow.,5
4538,"I would absolutely use this StAIR in my own classroom. This does a wonderful job of reviewing the coins and their amounts before requiring students to move ahead. I like the home button which allows students to review their coins as many times as needed before moving on in the activities. The text-to-speech feature is important, in that it allows students to focus on the money rather than reading a large amount of text. This can often times frustrate students, so it is great that a recording is provided. Inductive and deductive teaching strategies are used as students are allowed to review the coins, but they then must use their own strategies to add and compare coin amounts. The student will not become overwhelmed with graphics and background noise as each slide was created in a clean, well organized fashion. Background information is activated at the beginning of the presentation, and relationships are discovered through comparing the various coin amounts.  A range of technologies is incorporated through games and comparison activities, and automatic feedback is given after answering each question.  This is a great tool to use in the classroom, and could easily be adapted for any classroom.Technical Remarks:All links are currently working and accurate. Upon downloading the presentation, the user may be prompted to go navigate through a file before finding the PowerPoint presentation.",5
4538,This is a great presentation for those who are teaching about money to the lower grades.,5
4539,Very nice. These interactive representations make it easy and fun for students to understand the basic concepts in chemistry.,5
4540,There's no content here; the site has been shut down.,1
4541,"Steve, Overall I think this is great....it looks like you took your time in making your design pictures.  The yellow writing a the top of your slides is a little tricky to the eye to read but the point is there.  At first I thought that when I got the question wrong that there was no feedback but you had it linked to another correct one so that made sense.  Otherwise I think its pretty cool but I still don't understand the voltage terminology...glad you are in our class to help us learn more about cars!",4
4541,"Quality of ContentThis StAIR presents valid concepts, models and skills that students in the automotive field will find useful.  The material can be used for practice or to learn the concept for the first time.  There are clear definitions and great visuals to help reinforce the concept of voltage dropping.  The feedback on questions, specifically when answered incorrectly, is fantastic.  I really like that the presentation goes back through certain slides that will help the student to better understand what they did wrong.Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching-Learning ToolThere are very detailed drawings to help the student understand the concept presented.  These visuals would be especially helpful to someone who was learning the material for the first time.  One way to improve effectiveness would be to use a voice-over for some of the incorrect answers to explain a mistake, or to give a general explanation of the main definition at the start of the presentation.  Overall, this presentation is appropriate for students at the college level.Ease of UseStudents can access this from school and or home to grasp the concept.  The buttons on each slide are easy to use and the presentation is easy to navigate.",5
4542,Youtube is an excellent source to find videos that reinforce concepts. You can tell this one is geared towards a younger audience. Students are never too young to get involved in science!,4
4542,This video is great! He talks a little fast but has some great information and vsiual cues about water. Its hard to trust somethings posted on youtuble videos but this video and all his other videos are really good!,4
4542,This is a good video to help explain the concets of water. It it interesting and informative. ,4
4543,"Great StAIR design! I appreciate the consistency of the theme design and button placement. I thought that the incorrect slide with the ‘try again’ button was creative because you had to click the button to actually go back to the previous slide and try again.The video links worked well. From a technology perspective, I suggest you embed the videos into the PowerPoint program so that the StAIR user does not need to depend on internet speed and connection. It would also be much easier to navigate because you would not have to go back to the Power Point presentation. It would all be located in one place.I was intrigued by the question marks that turned into images and demonstrated the corresponding sounds. I think that was an engaging and meaningful touch to your creation.The song at the end was a nice touch. My sixth graders think these songs are so cheesy but always get a good laugh. As silly as they are, the content and tune always end up sticking in their minds.",5
4544,I really enjoyed the animations on this website. It provided a lot fo examples as well as animated examples that works perfectly for explaining volcanoes and their destructive power. ,4
4544,This website is pretty simple. The attached flash videos are much more useful in displaying and understanding the phenomena of the volcano.,3
4544,Great information! I ilke the video's that really help explain how volcano's work. Great to show in science classrooms as a visual aid.,4
4545,"I really enjoyed the lesson plan. It included so many different ways of engaging students. I liked that the students were invested in the activity. They video gives them a visual idea of what is happening and they can feel like they are actually on the journey. I also liked that students’ pictures were used instead of just names. It created an authentic way to engage students and make them feel part of the process. When the activity started, I liked that students were speaking, writing, and listening (all important standards) to the information. It was a great way to differentiate and really make sure students comprehended the content. The Smart Board is an effective, interactive way for the teacher and students to embrace the content. Overall, I think the lesson plan was extremely well-done and beneficial to the students.Technical Remarks:I did not find any technical issues with the lesson plan. The link to the material worked correctly. The lesson plan was easily accessible and well-formated.",4
4545,"I was blown away at the complexity of engagement with this assignment.  The idea that students will not only get a quick review of the planet names before hand, but then have to watch and comprehend a video (which is also a bit of a review) in order to even begin the assignment showed the amount of learning they needed to go through just to understand it.  Additionally, I loved that the teacher will be modeling this complex process for the students so that she can clarify any misunderstandings before students jumped into it.  Doing this will help not only with student motivation and engagement, but also with creates multiple means of representation for the information.  I also felt that the whole assignment provided mutliple means of engagement especially in the areas of recruiting interests and options for self regulation.  These were apparent to me in the video (recruiting interests) and in the fact that students had to form sentences correctly, on their own, in order to be ""rescued"" (options for self regulation).  Overall a great resource for students learning a foreign language.  Technical Remarks:I did not find any issues with this resource.",5

4547,"Andrell, I think the topic choice is very important in this day and age. Students truly need to learn how to be digital citizens and cyber bullying is part of this. What I would consider, in regards to UDL principles, is allowing studnets to review previously referenced material. If you were testing their retention, then clearly the current format works great. It just is a matter of pedagogical decisions vs. UDL principles. Overall, great work.",4
4547,"This was a great presentation to share with students about a very poignant topic, Cyber Bullying. I would recommended that this be shown in classrooms and have a discussion afterwards. The questions were a little long, but you can probably discuss further when showing in a classroom.Technical Remarks:The technology that was used worked well. ",4
4548,A fun and creative way to help others learn about wolves. It is always improving and is very interesting.,4
4549,"This is an excellent resource for introducing certain aspects of the Word program to students. I absolutely loved the visual and audio aspects. Hearing as well as seeing the information is something that, as an ESL teacher, I prize greatly. The material was well scaffolded and easy to follow. After each mini-lecture, there was a quiz to review the material if, like me, you forget things easily. The quizzes were constructive in that they gave strong encouragment - dancing star!! - for correct answers and took you back for review if you got it wrong.The formatting section was brilliant. It's not an easy thing to understand because it's just a bunch of rules. However, each step was shown very simply and then a super clear example was given to make sure that the students really understood what each rule meant and how a finished memo should look. I would love to use something similar to teach my students how to format an essay.Technical Remarks:Technically, this was well put together. The slides followed each other in a logical manner, and there was ample support as to the direction of the lesson.However, it seems that some of the information, such as the videos(?) and review games in the last three sections didn't make it into the show. This may be because I'm using PPT 2008, so you might want to check which version of PPT you have before using this.Based on what I did see, however, I would strongly recommend this resource to any teacher who wanted to introduce her students to the basics of the Word program.",5

4551,This video is quite helpful for faculty of all disciplines to offer students guidance as to writing a succesful article critique. Many beginning graduate students have never written such a critique in their undergraduate career; this video sets standards and relieves graduate faculty from having to devote class time to teaching students how to do an assignment that the course requires.Technical Remarks:Transcript available; another video in the six-part series covers how to read critically and summarize material.,4
4552,The XComputer applet illistrated very well the step-bystep process of a computer as it executes a program.  I liked how it went into detail on how each register is populated with each fetch and execution cycle.  Very good stuff for the student to understand the computing process.,4

4553,"Hi Xiaochen,     You did a great job! I love how you provide a general introduction at the very beginning. It is a very fun project to helping students learn about Chinese instruments and musics. You have applied to UDL designing to provide sounds, words and pictures as alternative ways for learning input. Well done!        However, one problem is, do not know if it is the problem from my computer, when I click on those signing indicating they are audios, I cannot really open them and hear. Maybe you can try again and fix that. Nice job!    Siming Hu",5
4553,"I like your presentation very much. It is well-organized with rich information. I like the part you ask students to make a presentation. It encourage them to do some research. But it also give them the variety of expression. But when I click the ""go to material"" button on MERLOT, it link me to a page, where I have to copy and paste on another webpage. It might be easier if the link can direct me to download the ppt. There are some music which can just start to play when the ppt page comes out. We can read the content while listening to the music.",5
4553,"I really enjoyed the graphics that you used in this StAIR, they complimented your topic very well. The design of your PowerPoint looked extremely nice as well; I think you did a great job picking the backgrounds for each slide.I also like the set up and flow of your project. First we learned about the different types of music. Then we learned about Chinese singers, and finally the traditional instruments used to make music. It was neat that we returned to the home page after each session. I think that is really helpful for students to see the big picture of your project: the objectives and the structure of the lesson.You also did a really nice job of providing options for perception. The students could see written words, hear sounds and see pictures for each instrument; and similarly words and sound were provided for each type of music. This provides the students with many alternatives for taking in the information.I mentioned that I like design and structure of your PowerPoint; there is simply one suggestion that I have to improve the ease of use of this StAIR. It was wonderful when I could click on the “sound” button and music would play. There were a few instances that we had to click on a link that would take us away from the presentation to hear music or see images. I know that technology can be tricky, but if there was a way to embed those things into your PowerPoint I think it would have improved the ease of use of your presentation.Lastly, I think that it would have been nice if you could have incorporated more quiz questions into this presentation. I know that the main assignment that goes with this StAIR is the project explained at the end, and I think it is a really great project that the students will learn a lot from, but it would have been nice to have more interaction throughout the learning portion of the presentation. Also, it would be nice if you could turn your questions into multiple choice so that the viewer can click on an option and see if they got it right or wrong, instead of needing a separate sheet of paper.Overall you have done a very nice job with your StAIR and I learned a lot from your project!",4
4554,What a great presentation on grammar.  This will be so useful to use in the classroom.  Two things I especially liked were the addition of the audio on your slide about independent and dependent clauses as well as the video links with more information.  ,5

4560,"Wow..this is a very well thought out presentation and also quite user-friendly.  I appreciate how the quiz is broken down into three sections, including; People, Events, and Terms, Concepts and Things.  It is an easy way to access the information the individual needs to quiz themselves on in order to better prepare for the assessment. I also really like the fact that if you click on the wrong answer, there is a meaningful explanation as to why that answer was possibly chosen and where to go from that point.  It even gives you additional information when you choose the correct answer.  I found this very helpful as I navigated my way through the presentation.Personally, I found this StAIR very resourceful, full of great information and quotes, and incredibly well laid out.Technical Remarks:The presentation is very appealing to the eye, easy to navigate, and all of the links work marvelously!  A job well done!",5
4560,"The 1960's is such an interesting period in time.   The way this resource navigates and teaches information is amazing!  I love the way you sorted things into categories (people, events, terms).  It's helpful for students sometimes to have things sorted for them if they are struggling to make meaning of so many ideas.  One consideration for this project would be to add video and audio.  For example, the questions that have quotes or talk about musicians would be great areas to add in media so students can further connect the knowledge.This is outstanding!!!Technical Remarks:The navigation is fabulous... I didn't find any gaps or missing links. Great job!",5
4561,"This is a well-developed course currciulum! I am impressed with the variety and diversity of authors and films. It will be an interesting addition to include one or two popular songs or music videos, especially since Bollywood has given the allure of a musical and enchanting South Asia. The course is divided into themes or topics, which will help focus the material around a central idea. The balance between the different cultures, genres and assignments is also very even. The pace seems fairly consistent.I am surprised Arundhati Roy is not included, since her novel was highly praised. Then again, I am unsure if her novel was written in English, or whether translated texts are permissible. I also recommend the classic 1892 play Girls for Sale by Gurajada Apparao, which is available in English translation. For literary research and scholarship, Dr. Asha Choubey recently published Women on Women, which is a groundbreaking collection of scholarship about Indian women writers and their female protagonists.Technical Remarks:The photos were vivid.

I will definately use this lesson style in my classroom.",5
